"1","On decentralized computation of the leader's strategy in bi-level games","Marko Maljkovic, Gustav Nilsson, Nikolas Geroliminis","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","Motivated by the omnipresence of hierarchical structures in many real-world applications, this study delves into the intricate realm of bi-level games, with a specific focus on exploring local Stackelberg equilibria as a solution concept. While existing literature offers various methods tailored to specific game structures featuring one leader and multiple followers, a comprehensive framework providing formal convergence guarantees to a local Stackelberg equilibrium appears to be lacking. Drawing inspiration from sensitivity results for nonlinear programs and guided by the imperative to maintain scalability and preserve agent privacy, we propose a decentralized approach based on the projected gradient descent with the Armijo stepsize rule. The main challenge here lies in assuring the existence and well-posedness of Jacobians that describe the leader's decision's influence on the achieved equilibrium of the followers. By meticulous tracking of the Implicit Function Theorem requirements at each iteration, we establish formal convergence guarantees to a local Stackelberg equilibrium for a broad class of bi-level games. Building on our prior work on quadratic aggregative Stackelberg games, we also introduce a decentralized warm-start procedure based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers addressing the previously reported initialization issues. Finally, we provide empirical validation through two case studies in smart mobility, showcasing the effectiveness of our general method in handling general convex constraints, and the effectiveness of its extension in tackling initialization issues.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 11:12:18 UTC (301 KB)"
"2","An Empirical Study on Oculus Virtual Reality Applications: Security and Privacy Perspectives","Hanyang Guo, Hong-Ning Dai, Xiapu Luo, Zibin Zheng, Gengyang Xu, Fengliang He","Software Engineering (cs.SE)","Although Virtual Reality (VR) has accelerated its prevalent adoption in emerging metaverse applications, it is not a fundamentally new technology. On one hand, most VR operating systems (OS) are based on off-the-shelf mobile OS. As a result, VR apps also inherit privacy and security deficiencies from conventional mobile apps. On the other hand, in contrast to conventional mobile apps, VR apps can achieve immersive experience via diverse VR devices, such as head-mounted displays, body sensors, and controllers though achieving this requires the extensive collection of privacy-sensitive human biometrics. Moreover, VR apps have been typically implemented by 3D gaming engines (e.g., Unity), which also contain intrinsic security vulnerabilities. Inappropriate use of these technologies may incur privacy leaks and security vulnerabilities although these issues have not received significant attention compared to the proliferation of diverse VR apps. In this paper, we develop a security and privacy assessment tool, namely the VR-SP detector for VR apps. The VR-SP detector has integrated program static analysis tools and privacy-policy analysis methods. Using the VR-SP detector, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on 500 popular VR apps. We obtain the original apps from the popular Oculus and SideQuest app stores and extract APK files via the Meta Oculus Quest 2 device. We evaluate security vulnerabilities and privacy data leaks of these VR apps by VR app analysis, taint analysis, and privacy-policy analysis. We find that a number of security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks widely exist in VR apps. Moreover, our results also reveal conflicting representations in the privacy policies of these apps and inconsistencies of the actual data collection with the privacy-policy statements of the apps. Based on these findings, we make suggestions for the future development of VR apps.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 13:53:25 UTC (958 KB)"

To enhance the reliability of usability evaluations, employing cognitive load measurement methods can be highly effective in assessing the mental effort required to complete tasks during user testing. This review aims to provide an overview of the most suitable cognitive load measurement methods for evaluating various types of user interfaces, serving as a valuable resource for guiding usability assessments. To bridge the existing gap in the literature, a systematic review was conducted, analyzing 76 articles with experimental study designs that met the eligibility criteria. The review encompasses different methods of measuring cognitive load applicable to assessing the usability of diverse user interfaces, including computer software, information systems, video games, web and mobile applications, robotics, and virtual reality applications. The results highlight the most widely utilized cognitive load measurement methods in software usability, their respective usage percentages, and their application in evaluating the usability of each user interface type. Additionally, the advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Furthermore, the review proposes a framework to assist usability testers in selecting an appropriate cognitive load measurement method for conducting accurate usability evaluations.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 04:25:35 UTC (1,192 KB)"
"4","Combinatorial Client-Master Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Task Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing","Tesfay Zemuy Gebrekidan, Sebastian Stein, Timothy J.Norman","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Recently, there has been an explosion of mobile applications that perform computationally intensive tasks such as video streaming, data mining, virtual reality, augmented reality, image processing, video processing, face recognition, and online gaming. However, user devices (UDs), such as tablets and smartphones, have a limited ability to perform the computation needs of the tasks. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology to meet the increasing computing demands of UDs. Task offloading in MEC is a strategy that meets the demands of UDs by distributing tasks between UDs and MEC servers. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is gaining attention in task-offloading problems because it can adapt to dynamic changes and minimize online computational complexity. However, the various types of continuous and discrete resource constraints on UDs and MEC servers pose challenges to the design of an efficient DRL-based task-offloading strategy. Existing DRL-based task-offloading algorithms focus on the constraints of the UDs, assuming the availability of enough storage resources on the server. Moreover, existing multiagent DRL (MADRL)--based task-offloading algorithms are homogeneous agents and consider homogeneous constraints as a penalty in their reward function. We proposed a novel combinatorial client-master MADRL (CCM\_MADRL) algorithm for task offloading in MEC (CCM\_MADRL\_MEC) that enables UDs to decide their resource requirements and the server to make a combinatorial decision based on the requirements of the UDs. CCM\_MADRL\_MEC is the first MADRL in task offloading to consider server storage capacity in addition to the constraints in the UDs. By taking advantage of the combinatorial action selection, CCM\_MADRL\_MEC has shown superior convergence over existing MADDPG and heuristic algorithms.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 17:17:15 UTC (762 KB)"

"7","A holographic mobile-based application for practicing pronunciation of basic English vocabulary for Spanish speaking children","R. Cerezo, V. Calderon, C. Romero","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","This paper describes a holographic mobile-based application designed to help Spanish-speaking children to practice the pronunciation of basic English vocabulary words. The mastery of vocabulary is a fundamental step when learning a language but is often perceived as boring. Producing the correct pronunciation is frequently regarded as the most difficult and complex skill for new learners of English. In order to address these problems this research takes advantage of the power of multi-channel stimuli (sound, image and interaction) in a mobilebased hologram application in order to motivate students and improve their experience of practicing. We adapted the prize-winning HolograFX game and developed a new mobile application to help practice English pronunciation. A 3D holographic robot that acts as a virtual teacher interacts via voice with the children. To test the tool we carried out an experiment with 70 Spanish pre-school children divided into three classes, the control group using traditional methods such as images in books and on the blackboard, and two experimental groups using our drills and practice software. One experimental group used the mobile application without the holographic game and the other experimental group used the application with the holographic game. We performed pre-test and post-test performance assessments, a satisfaction survey and emotion analysis. The results are very promising. They show that the use of the holographic mobile-based application had a significant impact on the children's motivation. It also improved their performance compared to traditional methods used in the classroom.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 18:58:01 UTC (2,016 KB)"
"8","Treatment Effect Estimation Amidst Dynamic Network Interference in Online Gaming Experiments","Yu Zhu, Zehang Richard Li, Yang Su, Zhenyu Zhao","Applications (stat.AP)","The evolving landscape of online multiplayer gaming presents unique challenges in assessing the causal impacts of game features. Traditional A/B testing methodologies fall short due to complex player interactions, leading to violations of fundamental assumptions like the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). Unlike traditional social networks with stable and long-term connections, networks in online games are often dynamic and short-lived. Players are temporarily teamed up for the duration of a game, forming transient networks that dissolve once the game ends. This fleeting nature of interactions presents a new challenge compared with running experiments in a stable social network. This study introduces a novel framework for treatment effect estimation in online gaming environments, considering the dynamic and ephemeral network interference that occurs among players. We propose an innovative estimator tailored for scenarios where a completely randomized experimental design is implemented without explicit knowledge of network structures. Notably, our method facilitates post-hoc interference adjustment on experimental data, significantly reducing the complexities and costs associated with intricate experimental designs and randomization strategies. The proposed framework stands out for its ability to accommodate varying levels of interference, thereby yielding more accurate and robust estimations. Through comprehensive simulations set against a variety of interference scenarios, along with empirical validation using real-world data from a mobile gaming environment, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. This study represents a pioneering effort in exploring causal inference in user-randomized experiments impacted by dynamic network effects.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 00:34:59 UTC (22,324 KB)"

However, lacking introspection into the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), cloud gaming servers are ill-poised to cope with the vagaries of the wireless last hop to a mobile client, while 5G network operators run mostly closed networks, limiting their potential for co-design with the wider internet and user applications. This paper presents Telesa, a passive, incrementally-deployable, and independently-deployable Standalone 5G network telemetry system that streams fine-grained RAN capacity, latency, and retransmission information to application servers to enable better millisecond scale, application-level decisions on offered load and bit rate adaptation than end-to-end latency measurements or end-to-end packet losses currently permit. We design, implement, and evaluate a Telesa telemetry-enhanced game streaming platform, demonstrating exact congestion-control that can better adapt game video bitrate while simultaneously controlling end-to-end latency, thus maximizing game quality of experience. Our experimental evaluation on a production 5G Standalone network demonstrates a 178-249% Quality of Experience improvement versus two state-of-the-art cloud gaming applications.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 22:44:27 UTC (9,234 KB)"

The IOC method determines unknown cost functions in a single- or multi-agent setting from observed system trajectories by minimizing the so-called residual error, i.e. the extent to which the optimality conditions of the MP are violated with a current guess of cost functions. The main assumption of the IOC method to recover cost functions such that the resulting trajectories match the observed ones is that the given trajectories are the result of an OC problem with a known parameterized cost function structure. However, in practice, when the IOC method is used to identify the behavior of unknown agents, e.g. humans, this assumption cannot be guaranteed. Hence, we introduce the notion of the trustworthiness of the residual error and provide necessary conditions for it to define when the IOC method based on the MP is still applicable to such problems. From the necessary conditions, we conclude that the residual-based IOC method cannot be used to validate OC models for unknown agents. Finally, we illustrate this problem by validating a differential game model for the collision avoidance behavior between two mobile robots with human operators.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 16:24:27 UTC (1,682 KB)"

Nevertheless, the swift movement of the LEO satellites poses a challenge: frequent handovers are inevitable, compromising the quality of service (QoS) of users and leading to discontinuous connectivity. Moreover, considering LEO satellite connectivity for different flying vehicles (FVs) when coexisting with ground terminals, an efficient satellite handover decision control and mobility management strategy is required to reduce the number of handovers and allocate resources that align with different users' requirements. In this paper, a novel distributed satellite handover strategy based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and game theory named Nash-SAC has been proposed to solve these problems. From the simulation results, the Nash-SAC-based handover strategy can effectively reduce the handovers by over 16 percent and the blocking rate by over 18 percent, outperforming local benchmarks such as traditional Q-learning. It also greatly improves the network utility used to quantify the performance of the whole system by up to 48 percent and caters to different users requirements, providing reliable and robust connectivity for both FVs and ground terminals.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 10:44:59 UTC (961 KB)"

A common practice consists of creating metrics out of data collected by player interactions with the content; however, this allows for estimation only after the content is released and does not consider the characteristics of potential future players. In this article, we present a number of potential solutions for the estimation of difficulty under such conditions, and we showcase the results of a comparative study intended to understand which method and which types of data perform better in different scenarios. The results reveal that models trained on a combination of cohort statistics and simulated data produce the most accurate estimations of difficulty in all scenarios. Furthermore, among these models, artificial neural networks show the most consistent results.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 20:51:42 UTC (746 KB)"

L is assumed to begin inside the circle and wishes to escape to the perimeter with some finite angular separation from M at the perimeter. This scenario has, in the past, been formulated as a zero-sum differential game wherein L seeks to maximize terminal separation and M seeks to minimize it. Its solution is well-known. However, there is a large portion of the state space for which the canonical solution does not yield a unique equilibrium strategy. This paper provides such a unique strategy by solving an auxiliary zero-sum differential game. In the auxiliary differential game, L seeks to reach a point opposite of M at a radius for which their maximum angular speeds are equal (i.e., the antipodal point). L wishes to minimize the time to reach this point while M wishes to maximize it. The solution of the auxiliary differential game is comprised of a Focal Line, a Universal Line, and their tributaries. The Focal Line tributaries' equilibrium strategy for L is semi-analytic, while the Universal Line tributaries' equilibrium strategy is obtained in closed form.","Fri, 26 Jan 2024 16:47:28 UTC (129 KB)"

UAV Twins (UTs), as the digital twins of UAVs that revolutionize UAV applications by making them more immersive, realistic, and informative, are deployed and updated on ground base stations, e.g., RoadSide Units (RSUs), to offer metaverse services for UAV Metaverse Users (UMUs). Due to the dynamic mobility of UAVs and limited communication coverages of RSUs, it is essential to perform real-time UT migration to ensure seamless immersive experiences for UMUs. However, selecting appropriate RSUs and optimizing the required bandwidth is challenging for achieving reliable and efficient UT migration. To address the challenges, we propose a tiny machine learning-based Stackelberg game framework based on pruning techniques for efficient UT migration in UAV metaverses. Specifically, we formulate a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg model considering a new immersion metric of UMUs in the utilities of UAVs. Then, we design a Tiny Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Tiny MADRL) algorithm to obtain the tiny networks representing the optimal game solution. Specifically, the actor-critic network leverages the pruning techniques to reduce the number of network parameters and achieve model size and computation reduction, allowing for efficient implementation of Tiny MADRL. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes have better performance than traditional schemes.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 02:14:13 UTC (19,925 KB)"

While hot fixing is an essential and common activity in software maintenance, it has never been surveyed as a research activity. Thus, such a review is long overdue. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of work on hot fixing. We highlight the fields where this topic has been addressed, inconsistencies we identified in the terminology, gaps in the literature, and directions for future work. Our search concluded with 91 papers on the topic between the year 2000 and 2022. The papers found encompass many different research areas such as log analysis, runtime patching (also known as hot patching), and automated repair, as well as various application domains such as security, mobile, and video games. We find that there are many directions that can take hot fix research forward such as unifying existing terminology, establishing a benchmark set of hot fixes, researching costs and frequency of hot fixes, and researching the possibility of end-to-end automation of detection, mitigation, and propagation. We discuss these avenues in detail to inspire the community to systematize hot fixing as a software engineering activity.

A typical application is to run machine learning (ML) services on facial images collected from different individuals. To prevent identity theft, conventional methods commonly rely on an adversarial game-based approach to shed the identity information from the feature. However, such methods can not defend against adaptive attacks, in which an attacker takes a countermove against a known defence strategy. We propose Crafter, a feature crafting mechanism deployed at the edge, to protect the identity information from adaptive model inversion attacks while ensuring the ML tasks are properly carried out in the cloud. The key defence strategy is to mislead the attacker to a non-private prior from which the attacker gains little about the private identity. In this case, the crafted features act like poison training samples for attackers with adaptive model updates. Experimental results indicate that Crafter successfully defends both basic and possible adaptive attacks, which can not be achieved by state-of-the-art adversarial game-based methods.","Sun, 14 Jan 2024 05:06:42 UTC (6,139 KB)"

Narahari","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Mechanism design is essentially reverse engineering of games and involves inducing a game among strategic agents in a way that the induced game satisfies a set of desired properties in an equilibrium of the game. Desirable properties for a mechanism include incentive compatibility, individual rationality, welfare maximisation, revenue maximisation (or cost minimisation), fairness of allocation, etc. It is known from mechanism design theory that only certain strict subsets of these properties can be simultaneously satisfied exactly by any given mechanism. Often, the mechanisms required by real-world applications may need a subset of these properties that are theoretically impossible to be simultaneously satisfied. In such cases, a prominent recent approach is to use a deep learning based approach to learn a mechanism that approximately satisfies the required properties by minimizing a suitably defined loss function. In this paper, we present, from relevant literature, technical details of using a deep learning approach for mechanism design and provide an overview of key results in this topic. We demonstrate the power of this approach for three illustrative case studies: (a) efficient energy management in a vehicular network (b) resource allocation in a mobile network (c) designing a volume discount procurement auction for agricultural inputs.

We consider a new setting in which the Searcher has some potentially erroneous information, or prediction on the Hider's position. Specifically, we study tradeoffs between the consistency of a search strategy (i.e., its worst case expected payoff assuming the prediction is correct) and the robustness (i.e., the worst case expected payoff assuming that the prediction is adversarially generated). We show how to apply this framework in search games over both discrete and continuous, as well as bounded and unbounded spaces. Specifically, we prove optimal consistency/robustness tradeoffs for three fundamental search games, namely searching in a number of discrete locations, expanding search in a tree network, and searching in the infinite line. Our study is the first to address the full power of mixed (randomized) strategies; previous work focused only on deterministic strategies, or relied on stochastic assumptions that do not guarantee worst-case robustness in adversarial situations.","Tue, 2 Jan 2024 10:59:29 UTC (22 KB)"

This growth was due in large part to a shift in monetization strategies: rather than charging players an upfront cost (""pay-to-play""), games often request optional microtransactions throughout gameplay (""free-to-play""). We focus on a common scenario in which games include wait times -- gating either items or game progression -- that players can pay to skip. Game designers typically say that they optimize for player happiness rather than revenue; however, prices for skips are typically set at levels that few players are willing to pay, leading to low purchase rates. Under a traditional analysis, it would seem that game designers fail at their stated goal if few players buy what they are selling. We argue that an alternate model can better explain this dynamic: players value tasks more highly as they are perceived to be more difficult. While skips can increase players' utilities by providing instant gratification, pricing skips too cheaply can lower players' utilities by decreasing the perceived amount of work needed to complete a task. We show that high revenue, high player utility, and low purchase rates can all coexist under this model, particularly under a realistic distribution of players having few buyers but a few big-spending ""whales."" We also investigate how a game designer should optimize prices under our model.","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 21:01:37 UTC (1,937 KB)"

The decentralization of both the integrity and security of digital items has spurred the popularity of play-to-earn (P2E) games, where players are entitled to earn and own digital assets which they may trade for physical-world currencies. However, these computationally-intensive games are hardly playable on resource-limited mobile devices and the computational tasks have to be offloaded to an edge server. Through mobile edge computing (MEC), users can upload data to the Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) edge servers for computing. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between user-perceived in-game latency and user visual experience. The downlink transmission of lower-resolution videos lowers user-perceived latency while lowering the visual fidelity and consequently, earnings of users. In this paper, we design a method to enhance the Metaverse-based mobile augmented reality (MAR) in-game user experience. Specifically, we formulate and solve a multi-objective optimization problem. Given the inherent NP-hardness of the problem, we present a low-complexity algorithm to address it, mitigating the trade-off between delay and earnings. The experiment results show that our method can effectively balance the user-perceived latency and profitability, thus improving the performance of Metaverse-based MAR systems.","Sun, 10 Dec 2023 12:46:51 UTC (1,167 KB)"

This paper investigates a series of cross-layer matching mechanisms to achieve stable and cost-effective resource provisioning across different layers (i.e., MUs, ESs, CSs), seamlessly integrated into a novel hybrid paradigm that incorporates futures and spot trading. In futures trading, we explore an overbooking-driven aforehand cross-layer matching (OA-CLM) mechanism, facilitating two future contract types: contract between MUs and ESs, and contract between ESs and CSs, while assessing potential risks under historical statistical analysis. In spot trading, we design two backup plans respond to current network/market conditions: determination on contractual MUs that should switch to local processing from edge/cloud services; and an onsite cross-layer matching (OS-CLM) mechanism that engages participants in real-time practical transactions. We next show that our matching mechanisms theoretically satisfy stability, individual rationality, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Comprehensive simulations in real-world and numerical network settings confirm the corresponding efficacy, while revealing remarkable improvements in time/energy efficiency and social welfare.","Thu, 7 Dec 2023 07:52:55 UTC (6,579 KB)"
"24","Exploring Large Language Models for Human Mobility Prediction under Public Events","Yuebing Liang, Yichao Liu, Xiaohan Wang, Zhan Zhao","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Public events, such as concerts and sports games, can be major attractors for large crowds, leading to irregular surges in travel demand. Accurate human mobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as well as traffic or crowd management. While rich textual descriptions about public events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to encode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing methods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling data sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public events (LLM-MPE) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their unprecedented ability to process textual data, learn from minimal examples, and generate human-readable explanations. Specifically, LLM-MPE first transforms raw, unstructured event descriptions from online sources into a standardized format, and then segments historical mobility data into regular and event-related components. A prompting strategy is designed to direct LLMs in making and rationalizing demand predictions considering historical mobility and event features. A case study is conducted for Barclays Center in New York City, based on publicly available event information and taxi trip data. Results show that LLM-MPE surpasses traditional models, particularly on event days, with textual data significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, LLM-MPE offers interpretable insights into its predictions. Despite the great potential of LLMs, we also identify key challenges including misinformation and high costs that remain barriers to their broader adoption in large-scale human mobility analysis.","Wed, 29 Nov 2023 04:25:15 UTC (3,663 KB)"

Ideally, 3D reconstruction methods should generate high-fidelity results with 3D consistency in real-time. Traditional methods match pixels between images using photo-consistency constraints or learned features, while differentiable rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) use differentiable volume rendering or surface-based representation to generate high-fidelity scenes. However, these methods require excessive runtime for rendering, making them impractical for daily applications. To address these challenges, we present $\textbf{EvaSurf}$, an $\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{V}$iew-$\textbf{A}$ware implicit textured $\textbf{Surf}$ace reconstruction method on mobile devices. In our method, we first employ an efficient surface-based model with a multi-view supervision module to ensure accurate mesh reconstruction. To enable high-fidelity rendering, we learn an implicit texture embedded with a set of Gaussian lobes to capture view-dependent information. Furthermore, with the explicit geometry and the implicit texture, we can employ a lightweight neural shader to reduce the expense of computation and further support real-time rendering on common mobile devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can reconstruct high-quality appearance and accurate mesh on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Moreover, our method can be trained in just 1-2 hours using a single GPU and run on mobile devices at over 40 FPS (Frames Per Second), with a final package required for rendering taking up only 40-50 MB.","Thu, 16 Nov 2023 11:30:56 UTC (6,036 KB)[v2] Sat, 18 Nov 2023 07:30:54 UTC (6,050 KB)"

It is common for digital versions of board games, as any other type of digital games, to offer the option to select the difficulty of the game. This is usually done by customizing the search parameters of the AI algorithm. However, this approach cannot be extended to General Game Playing agents, as different games might require different parametrization for each difficulty level. In this paper, we present a general approach to implement an artificial intelligence opponent with difficulty levels for zero-sum games, together with a propose of a Minimax-MCTS hybrid algorithm, which combines the minimax search process with GGP aspects of MCTS. This approach was tested in our mobile application LoBoGames, an extensible board games platform, that is intended to have an broad catalog of games, with an emphasis on accessibility: the platform is friendly to visually-impaired users, and is compatible with more than 92\% of Android devices.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic examination of QUIC's performance over high-speed networks. We find that over fast Internet, the UDP+QUIC+HTTP/3 stack suffers a data rate reduction of up to 45.2% compared to the TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 counterpart. Moreover, the performance gap between QUIC and HTTP/2 grows as the underlying bandwidth increases. We observe this issue on lightweight data transfer clients and major web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera), on different hosts (desktop, mobile), and over diverse networks (wired broadband, cellular). It affects not only file transfers, but also various applications such as video streaming (up to 9.8% video bitrate reduction) and web browsing.

Griesbach, Martin Hoefer, Max Klimm, Tim Koglin","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","We study a novel approach to information design in the standard traffic model of network congestion games. It captures the natural condition that the demand is unknown to the users of the network. A principal (e.g., a mobility service) commits to a signaling strategy, observes the realized demand and sends a (public) signal to agents (i.e., users of the network). Based on the induced belief about the demand, the users then form an equilibrium. We consider the algorithmic goal of the principal: Compute a signaling scheme that minimizes the expected total cost of the induced equilibrium. We concentrate on single-commodity networks and affine cost functions, for which we obtain the following results. First, we devise a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the case that the demand can only take two values. It relies on several structural properties of the cost of the induced equilibrium as a function of the updated belief about the distribution of demands. We show that this function is piecewise linear for any number of demands, and monotonic for two demands. Second, we give a complete characterization of the graph structures for which it is optimal to fully reveal the information about the realized demand. This signaling scheme turns out to be optimal for all cost functions and probability distributions over demands if and only if the graph is series-parallel. Third, we propose an algorithm that computes the optimal signaling scheme for any number of demands whose time complexity is polynomial in the number of supports that occur in a Wardrop equilibrium for some demand. Finally, we conduct a computational study that tests this algorithm on real-world instances.","Thu, 12 Oct 2023 13:22:57 UTC (2,614 KB)"

The actual value of the degree when this happens is much smaller than that of the complete graph, and the threshold value depends on other network characteristics.","Mon, 31 Jul 2023 14:57:34 UTC (152 KB)"

These three types of localization can be ""fused"" to create a more accurate state estimate using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF is a nonlinear full-state estimator that approximates the state estimate with the lowest covariance error when given the sensor measurements, the model prediction, and their variances.

We assess eVTOL energy consumption and CO$_2$ emissions on urban and regional routes, comparing them with cars, public transport, and helicopters. Urban eVTOLs save around 23 minutes over cars and 22 minutes over public transport on 50 km routes. For regional routes (300 km), eVTOLs save 76 minutes over cars and 69 minutes over trains. However, eVTOLs' eco-friendliness depends on context. In urban areas, they consume more energy than electric cars, but beat traditional helicopters by 47%. For regional travel, eVTOLs outperform helicopters and some cars but lag behind electric vehicles and trains. To maximize AAM's sustainability in Paris, stakeholders must consider real-world operations and integrate eVTOLs into the broader transportation system.

However, UAVs face the challenges of limited battery capacity and computing resources, which could shorten the expected flight endurance of UAVs and increase the rescue response delay during performing mission-critical tasks. To address this challenge, we first present a three-layer post-disaster rescue computing architecture by leveraging the aerial-terrestrial edge capabilities of mobile edge computing (MEC) and vehicle fog computing (VFC), which consists of a vehicle fog layer, a UAV client layer, and a UAV edge layer. Moreover, we formulate a joint task offloading and resource allocation optimization problem (JTRAOP) with the aim of maximizing the time-average system utility. Since the formulated JTRAOP is proved to be NP-hard, we propose an MEC-VFC-aided task offloading and resource allocation (MVTORA) approach, which consists of a game theoretic algorithm for task offloading decision, a convex optimization-based algorithm for MEC resource allocation, and an evolutionary computation-based hybrid algorithm for VFC resource allocation. Simulation results validate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the other benchmark schemes, especially under heavy system workloads.","Thu, 17 Aug 2023 10:59:53 UTC (2,640 KB)[v2] Fri, 6 Oct 2023 07:40:13 UTC (2,618 KB)"

However, developing models capable of effectively handling input time series data presents an enduring challenge. This study presents novel preference learning approaches to multiple criteria sorting problems in the presence of temporal criteria. We first formulate a convex quadratic programming model characterized by fixed time discount factors, operating within a regularization framework. To enhance scalability and accommodate learnable time discount factors, we introduce a novel monotonic Recurrent Neural Network (mRNN). It is designed to capture the evolving dynamics of preferences over time while upholding critical properties inherent to MCS problems, including criteria monotonicity, preference independence, and the natural ordering of classes. The proposed mRNN can describe the preference dynamics by depicting marginal value functions and personalized time discount factors along with time, effectively amalgamating the interpretability of traditional MCS methods with the predictive potential offered by deep preference learning models. Comprehensive assessments of the proposed models are conducted, encompassing synthetic data scenarios and a real-case study centered on classifying valuable users within a mobile gaming app based on their historical in-app behavioral sequences.

A mobile crowdsensing platform (MCSP) sequentially publishes sensing tasks to the available mobile units (MUs) that signal their willingness to participate in a task by sending sensing offers back to the MCSP. From the received offers, the MCSP decides the task assignment. A stable task assignment must address two challenges: the MCSP's and MUs' conflicting goals, and the uncertainty about the MUs' required efforts and preferences. To overcome these challenges a novel decentralized approach combining matching theory and online learning, called collision-avoidance multi-armed bandit with strategic free sensing (CA-MAB-SFS), is proposed. The task assignment problem is modeled as a matching game considering the MCSP's and MUs' individual goals while the MUs learn their efforts online. Our innovative ""free-sensing"" mechanism significantly improves the MU's learning process while reducing collisions during task allocation. The stable regret of CA-MAB-SFS, i.e., the loss of learning, is analytically shown to be bounded by a sublinear function, ensuring the convergence to a stable optimal solution. Simulation results show that CA-MAB-SFS increases the MUs' and the MCSP's satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the average task completion time by at least 16%.","Tue, 19 Sep 2023 13:07:15 UTC (3,889 KB)"

An edge of the tree is revealed to the team when one agent becomes adjacent to that edge. The agents start from the root and all move synchronously along one adjacent edge in each round. Communication between the agents is unrestricted, and they are, therefore, centrally controlled by a single exploration algorithm. The algorithm's guarantee is typically compared to the number of rounds required by the agents to go through all edges if they had known the tree in advance. This quantity is at least $\max\{2n/k,2D\}$ where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the tree depth. Since the introduction of the problem by [FGKP04], two types of guarantees have emerged: the first takes the form $r(k)(n/k+D)$, where $r(k)$ is called the competitive ratio, and the other takes the form $2n/k+f(k,D)$, where $f(k,D)$ is called the competitive overhead. In this paper, we present the first algorithm with linear-in-$D$ competitive overhead, thereby reconciling both approaches. Specifically, our bound is in $2n/k + O(k^{\log_2(k)-1} D)$ and leads to a competitive ratio in $O(k/\exp(\sqrt{\ln 2\ln k}))$. This is the first improvement over $O(k/\ln k)$ since the introduction of the problem, twenty years ago. Our algorithm is developed for an asynchronous generalization of collective tree exploration (ACTE). It belongs to a broad class of locally-greedy exploration algorithms that we define. We show that the analysis of locally-greedy algorithms can be seen through the lens of a 2-player game that we call the tree-mining game and which could be of independent interest.","Wed, 13 Sep 2023 15:03:18 UTC (303 KB)[v2] Mon, 30 Oct 2023 18:07:12 UTC (302 KB)"

However, as the number of ISAC devices growing, there exists intensive interactions among ISAC devices in the processes of data collection and processing since they share the common network resources. In this paper, we consider the environment sensing problem in the large-scale mobile crowd ISCC systems and propose an efficient waveform precoding design algorithm based on the mean field game~(MFG). Specifically, to handle the complex interactions among large-scale ISAC devices, we first utilize the MFG method to transform the influence from other ISAC devices into the mean field term and derive the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, which models the evolution of the system state. Then, we derive the cost function based on the mean field term and reformulate the waveform precoding design problem. Next, we utilize the G-prox primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm to solve the reformulated problem and analyze the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can solve the interactions among large-scale ISAC devices effectively in the ISCC process.

The experiments using simulated mobile robot pedestrian interactions and real-world automated driving data provide empirical evidence that the game-theoretic layer improves the predictive performance of various neural network backbones.","Thu, 31 Aug 2023 08:30:11 UTC (3,935 KB)[v2] Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:37:54 UTC (3,944 KB)"
"48","To Rectify Routing Games for Social Information Sharing","Songhua Li, Lingjie Duan","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Crowdsourcing services, such as Waze and Google Maps, leverage a mass of mobile users to learn massive point-of-interest (PoI) information while traveling and share it as a public good. Given that crowdsourced users mind their travel costs and possess various preferences over the PoI information along different paths, we formulate the problem as a novel non-atomic multi-path routing game with positive network externalities among users in social information sharing, which distinguishes itself from the routing game literature. In the absence of any incentive design, our price of anarchy (PoA) analysis shows that users' selfish routing on the path with the lowest cost will limit information diversity and lead to an arbitrarily large efficiency loss from the social optimum. This motivates us to design effective incentive mechanisms to remedy while upholding desirable properties such as individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget balance for practical feasibility. Moreover, our mechanisms are designed with incomplete information, as they do not rely on individual user's path preferences, thereby ensuring user privacy. To start with, we present a non-monetary mechanism called Adaptive Information Restriction (AIR) that imposes fractions on users' access to the public good as an indirect penalty. By adapting penalty fractions to the actual user flows along different paths, our AIR achieves the first PoA of $\frac{1}{4}$ for the problem. Then, we delve into a monetary mechanism called Adaptive Side-Payment (ASP) that charges or rewards side payments over users choosing certain paths. With those side payments well-tailored, ASP significantly improves the PoA to $\frac{1}{2}$.","Fri, 25 Aug 2023 10:52:52 UTC (1,425 KB)[v2] Tue, 12 Sep 2023 09:57:51 UTC (1,431 KB)[v3] Fri, 26 Jan 2024 04:57:08 UTC (1,523 KB)"

Smith, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Junwei Lu","Machine Learning (stat.ML)","We propose a nonparametric additive model for estimating interpretable value functions in reinforcement learning. Learning effective adaptive clinical interventions that rely on digital phenotyping features is a major for concern medical practitioners. With respect to spine surgery, different post-operative recovery recommendations concerning patient mobilization can lead to significant variation in patient recovery. While reinforcement learning has achieved widespread success in domains such as games, recent methods heavily rely on black-box methods, such neural networks. Unfortunately, these methods hinder the ability of examining the contribution each feature makes in producing the final suggested decision. While such interpretations are easily provided in classical algorithms such as Least Squares Policy Iteration, basic linearity assumptions prevent learning higher-order flexible interactions between features. In this paper, we present a novel method that offers a flexible technique for estimating action-value functions without making explicit parametric assumptions regarding their additive functional form. This nonparametric estimation strategy relies on incorporating local kernel regression and basis expansion to obtain a sparse, additive representation of the action-value function. Under this approach, we are able to locally approximate the action-value function and retrieve the nonlinear, independent contribution of select features as well as joint feature pairs. We validate the proposed approach with a simulation study, and, in an application to spine disease, uncover recovery recommendations that are inline with related clinical knowledge.","Fri, 25 Aug 2023 02:05:51 UTC (7,930 KB)"
"50","Out of the Box Thinking: Improving Customer Lifetime Value Modelling via Expert Routing and Game Whale Detection","Shijie Zhang, Xin Yan, Xuejiao Yang, Binfeng Jia, Shuangyang Wang","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction is essential for mobile game publishers trying to optimize the advertising investment for each user acquisition based on the estimated worth. In mobile games, deploying microtransactions is a simple yet effective monetization strategy, which attracts a tiny group of game whales who splurge on in-game purchases. The presence of such game whales may impede the practicality of existing LTV prediction models, since game whales' purchase behaviours always exhibit varied distribution from general users. Consequently, identifying game whales can open up new opportunities to improve the accuracy of LTV prediction models. However, little attention has been paid to applying game whale detection in LTV prediction, and existing works are mainly specialized for the long-term LTV prediction with the assumption that the high-quality user features are available, which is not applicable in the UA stage. In this paper, we propose ExpLTV, a novel multi-task framework to perform LTV prediction and game whale detection in a unified way. In ExpLTV, we first innovatively design a deep neural network-based game whale detector that can not only infer the intrinsic order in accordance with monetary value, but also precisely identify high spenders (i.e., game whales) and low spenders. Then, by treating the game whale detector as a gating network to decide the different mixture patterns of LTV experts assembling, we can thoroughly leverage the shared information and scenario-specific information (i.e., game whales modelling and low spenders modelling). Finally, instead of separately designing a purchase rate estimator for two tasks, we design a shared estimator that can preserve the inner task relationships. The superiority of ExpLTV is further validated via extensive experiments on three industrial datasets.","Thu, 24 Aug 2023 12:08:07 UTC (1,763 KB)"

This potential justifies the enthusiasm and growing interest in DRL in both academia and industry. However, the community currently focuses mostly on the development phase of DRL systems, with little attention devoted to DRL deployment. In this paper, we propose an empirical study on Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular Q&A forum for developers, to uncover and understand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying DRL systems. Specifically, we categorized relevant SO posts by deployment platforms: server/cloud, mobile/embedded system, browser, and game engine. After filtering and manual analysis, we examined 357 SO posts about DRL deployment, investigated the current state, and identified the challenges related to deploying DRL systems. Then, we investigate the prevalence and difficulty of these challenges. Results show that the general interest in DRL deployment is growing, confirming the study's relevance and importance. Results also show that DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. Additionally, we built a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges in deploying DRL to different platforms. On all platforms, RL environment-related challenges are the most popular, and communication-related challenges are the most difficult among practitioners. We hope our study inspires future research and helps the community overcome the most common and difficult challenges practitioners face when deploying DRL systems.","Wed, 23 Aug 2023 21:44:09 UTC (1,406 KB)"

Careful strategic placement of honeypots in networks should consider not only network aspects but also attackers' preferences. The allocation of honeypots in tactical networks under network mobility is of great interest. To achieve this objective, we present a game-theoretic approach that generates optimal honeypot allocation strategies within an attack/defense scenario. Our proposed approach takes into consideration the changes in network connectivity. In particular, we introduce a two-player dynamic game model that explicitly incorporates the future state evolution resulting from changes in network connectivity. The defender's objective is twofold: to maximize the likelihood of the attacker hitting a honeypot and to minimize the cost associated with deception and reconfiguration due to changes in network topology. We present an iterative algorithm to find Nash equilibrium strategies and analyze the scalability of the algorithm. Finally, we validate our approach and present numerical results based on simulations, demonstrating that our game model successfully enhances network security.

With the help of mobile relays (MRs) installed on the roof of the train, the application of Millimeter-Wave (mm-wave) communication which has rich spectrum resources to the train-ground communication system can realize high data rate, so as to meet users' increasing demand for broad-band multimedia access. Also, full-duplex (FD) technology can theoretically double the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we formulate the user association and transmission scheduling problem in the mm-wave train-ground communication system with MR operating in the FD mode as a nonlinear programming problem. In order to maximize the system throughput and the number of users meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements, we propose an algorithm based on coalition game to solve the challenging NP-hard problem, and also prove the convergence and Nash-stable structure of the proposed algorithm.

In particular, we describe the transition between the usable part of the boundary of the target (where the value vanishes) and the non-usable part (where the value is positive). We show that the value enjoys a different behaviour depending on the regularity of the obstacles involved in the game. Namely, we prove that the boundary profile is continuous for the case of smooth obstacles, and that it exhibits a jump discontinuity when the obstacle contains corners. Moreover, we prove that, in the latter case, there is a semi-permeable barrier emanating from the interface between the usable and the non-usable part of the boundary of the target set.","Thu, 17 Aug 2023 18:47:52 UTC (1,286 KB)[v2] Fri, 25 Aug 2023 00:05:35 UTC (1,287 KB)"

The existing solutions for realizing MAR combine multiple technologies like edge, cloud computing, and fifth-generation (5G) networks. However, the inherent communication latency of visual data imposes apparent limitations on the quality of experience (QoE). To address the challenge, we propose an emergent semantic communication framework to learn the communication protocols in MAR. Specifically, we train two agents through a modified Lewis signaling game to emerge a discrete communication protocol spontaneously. Based on this protocol, two agents can communicate about the abstract idea of visual data through messages with extremely small data sizes in a noisy channel, which leads to message errors. To better simulate real-world scenarios, we incorporate channel uncertainty into our training process. Experiments have shown that the proposed scheme has better generalization on unseen objects than traditional object recognition used in MAR and can effectively enhance communication efficiency through the utilization of small-size messages.","Sat, 12 Aug 2023 16:45:39 UTC (2,060 KB)"

In this paper, we focus on the interactions between citizens who compete for the limited resources of a mobility system to complete their desired trip. Specifically, we present a game-theoretic framework for multi-modal mobility systems, where citizens, characterized by heterogeneous preferences, have access to various mobility options and seek individually-optimal decisions. We study the arising game and prove the existence of an equilibrium, which can be efficiently computed via a convex optimization problem. Through both an analytical and a numerical case study for the classic scenario of Sioux Falls, USA, we illustrate the capabilities of our model and perform sensitivity analyses.

We present a four-tier task processing architecture for MEC and vehicular networks, which includes processing tasks locally within a vehicle, on neighboring vehicles, on an edge cloud, and on a remote cloud. The flexible network connection is controlled by SDN. We propose a CPU resource allocation algorithm, called Partial Idle Resource Strategy (PIRS) with Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communications, based on Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Solution (ANBS) in Game Theory. PIRS encourages vehicles in the same location to cooperate by sharing part of their spare CPU resources. In our simulations, we adopt four applications running on the vehicles to generate workload. We compare the proposed algorithm with Non-Cooperation Strategy (NCS) and All Idle Resource Strategy (AIRS). In NCS, the vehicles execute tasks generated by the applications in their own On-Board Units (OBU), while in AIRS vehicles provide all their CPU resources to help other vehicles offloading requests. Our simulation results show that our PIRS strategy can execute more tasks on the V2V layer and lead to fewer number of task (and their length) to be offloaded to the cloud, reaching up to 28% improvement compared to NCS and up to 10% improvement compared to AIRS.","Tue, 8 Aug 2023 20:24:26 UTC (1,812 KB)"

In this paper, we propose a new method for recovering lost or corrupted video frames in cloud gaming. Unlike traditional video frame recovery, our approach uses game states to significantly enhance recovery accuracy and utilizes partially decoded frames to recover lost portions. We develop a holistic system that consists of (i) efficiently extracting game states, (ii) modifying H.264 video decoder to generate a mask to indicate which portions of video frames need recovery, and (iii) designing a novel neural network to recover either complete or partial video frames.

This is then compared to the level completion rate of a large sample of real players.We find that the strongest predictor of player completion rate for a level is the number of moves taken to complete a level of the ~5% best runs of the agent on a given level. A very interesting observation is that, while in absolute terms, the agent is unable to reach human-level performance across all levels, the differences in terms of behaviour between levels are highly correlated to the differences in human behaviour. Thus, despite performing sub-par, it is still possible to use the performance of the agent to estimate, and perhaps further model, player metrics.","Mon, 26 Jun 2023 12:00:05 UTC (4,302 KB)"

However, the heavy sparsity of consumption events and the interference of data variance and noise obstruct LTV estimation. Many existing LTV prediction methods directly train a single-view LTV predictor on consumption samples, which may yield inaccurate and even biased knowledge extraction. In this paper, we propose a contrastive multi-view framework for LTV prediction, which is a plug-and-play solution compatible with various backbone models. It synthesizes multiple heterogeneous LTV regressors with complementary knowledge to improve model robustness and captures sample relatedness via contrastive learning to mitigate the dependency on data abundance. Concretely, we use a decomposed scheme that converts the LTV prediction problem into a combination of estimating consumption probability and payment amount. To alleviate the impact of noisy data on model learning, we propose a multi-view framework that jointly optimizes multiple types of regressors with diverse characteristics and advantages to encode and fuse comprehensive knowledge. To fully exploit the potential of limited training samples, we propose a hybrid contrastive learning method to help capture the relatedness between samples in both classification and regression tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world game LTV prediction dataset and the results validate the effectiveness of our method.

DNN surgery, which partitions DNN processing between mobile devices and multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers, can enable real-time inference despite the computational limitations of mobile devices. However, DNN surgery faces a critical challenge: determining the optimal computing resource demand from the server and the corresponding partition strategy, while considering both inference latency and MEC server usage costs. This problem is compounded by two factors: (1) the finite computing capacity of the MEC server, which is shared among multiple devices, leading to inter-dependent demands, and (2) the shift in modern DNN architecture from chains to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which complicates potential solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel Decentralized DNN Surgery (DDS) framework.

We first provide some theoretical conditions that hold for the static game and also help identify good strategies valid under any setup, including dynamic games. Since dynamic games, although more realistic, are characterized by an exploding strategy space, we exploit reinforcement learning to obtain efficient strategies leading to equilibrium outcomes.

We propose a new Heteroskedasticity Adjusted Multiple Testing (HAMT) procedure that avoids data reduction by standardization, and directly incorporates the side information from the variances into the testing procedure. Our approach relies on an improved nonparametric empirical Bayes deconvolution estimator that offers a practical strategy for capturing the dependence between the inferential parameter of interest and the variance of the test statistic.

The existing methods find it difficult to learn from biased reviews to infer the actual service state, as the state can also be extreme and the platform cannot verify the truthfulness of reviews immediately. Further, reviewers can hide their (positive or negative) bias types and proactively adjust their anonymous reviews against the platform's inference. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study how to save mobile crowdsourcing from cheap-talk and strategically learn from biased users' reviews. We formulate the problem as a dynamic Bayesian game, including users' service-type messaging and the platform's follow-up rating/inference. Our closed-form PBE shows that an extremely-biased user may still honestly message to convince the platform of listening to his review. Such Bayesian game-theoretic learning obviously outperforms the latest common schemes especially when there are multiple diversely-biased users to compete.

More often this kind of data is categorical and sparse in nature making it even more difficult to interpret any underlying hidden patterns such as clusters of users. However, if this information can be estimated accurately, it will have huge impacts in different business areas such as user recommendations for apps, songs, movies, and other similar products, health analytics using electronic health record (EHR) data, and driver profiling for insurance premium estimation or fleet management. In this work, we propose a clustering strategy of such categorical big data, utilizing the hidden sparsity of the dataset. Most traditional clustering methods fail to give proper clusters for such data and end up giving one big cluster with small clusters around it irrespective of the true structure of the data clusters. We propose a feature transformation, which maps the binary-valued usage vector to a lower dimensional continuous feature space in terms of groups of usage categories, termed as covariate classes. The lower dimensional feature representations in terms of covariate classes can be used for clustering. We implemented the proposed strategy and applied it to a large sized very high-dimensional song playlist dataset for the performance validation. The results are impressive as we achieved similar-sized user clusters with minimal between-cluster overlap in the feature space (8%) on average).

The results of the research showed that all three algorithms were able to effectively classify users based on their individual touch dynamics, with accuracy ranging from 80% to 95%. The Neural Network algorithm performed the best, achieving the highest accuracy and precision scores, followed closely by XGBoost and SVC. The data shows that continuous authentication using mobile touch dynamics has the potential to be a useful method for enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access to personal devices. This research also notes the importance of choosing the correct algorithm for a given dataset and use case, as different algorithms may have varying levels of performance depending on the specific task.","Mon, 24 Apr 2023 13:45:25 UTC (444 KB)"
"70","Dissertation on Applied Microeconomics of Freemium Pricing Strategies in Mobile App Market","Naixin Zhu","General Economics (econ.GN)","In my dissertation, I will analyze how the product market position of a mobile app affects its pricing strategies, which in turn impacts an app's monetization process. Using natural language processing and k-mean clustering on apps' text descriptions, I created a new variable that measures the distinctiveness of an app as compared to its peers. I created four pricing variables, price, cumulative installs, and indicators of whether an app contains in-app ads and purchases. I found that the effect differs for successful apps and less successful apps. I measure the success here using cumulative installs and the firms that developed the apps. Based on third-party rankings and the shape of the distribution of installs, I set two thresholds and divided apps into market-leading and market-follower apps. The market-leading sub-sample consists of apps with high cumulative installs or developed by prestigious firms, and the market-follower sub-sample consists of the rest of the apps. I found that the impact of being niche is smaller in the market-leading apps because of their relatively higher heterogeneity. In addition, being niche also impact utility apps differently from hedonic apps or apps with two-sided market characteristics. For the special gaming category, being niche has some effect but is smaller than in the market follower sub-sample. My research provides novel empirical evidence of digital products to various strands of theoretical research, including the optimal distinctiveness theory, product differentiation, price discrimination in two or multi-sided markets, and consumer psychology.","Sat, 22 Apr 2023 04:19:06 UTC (8,047 KB)"

Rangel","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","We investigate a tritrophic system in which organisms' energy depletion, resulting from failed selection attempts, leads to a partial loss of capacity to win the cyclic spatial game. The energy required to maintain optimal organism fitness may be impacted by changes in environmental conditions, increasing the death risk due to accelerated deterioration of health. We simulate the evolutionary behavioural strategy performed by individuals of one species, which consists in balancing efforts dedicated to reproduction and mobility to minimise the chances of death by lack of energy. We show that the unevenness introduced by the trade-off strategy unbalances the rock-paper-scissors model, with the predominant species profiting from enemies' lower birth rate of enemies. Quantifying the spatial patterns, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale of single-species domains decreases as energy loss accelerates due to environmental changes. The erosion in the spatial patterns provoked by the reproduction-mobility trade-off benefits biodiversity, with coexistence probability rising for faster energy depletion and higher trade-off factors. The findings have implications for ecologists seeking to understand the impact of survival behaviour on biodiversity promotion.","Thu, 4 May 2023 23:04:03 UTC (2,383 KB)"

Chow","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) systems are two-sided markets, with two mutually exclusive sets of agents, i.e., travelers/users and operators, forming a mobility ecosystem in which multiple operators compete or cooperate to serve customers under a governing platform provider. This study proposes a MaaS platform equilibrium model based on many-to-many assignment games incorporating both fixed-route transit services and mobility-on-demand (MOD) services. The matching problem is formulated as a multicommodity flow network design problem under congestion. The local stability conditions reflect a generalization of Wardrop's principles that include operator decisions. A subsidy mechanism from the platform is proposed to guarantee local stability. An exact solution algorithm is proposed based on a branch and bound framework with a Frank-Wolfe algorithm integrated with Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient optimization, which guarantees the optimality of the matching problem but not stability. A heuristic which integrates stability conditions and subsidy design is proposed, which reaches either the optimal MaaS platform equilibrium solution with global stability, or a feasible locally stable solution that may require subsidy. A worst-case bound and condition for obtaining an exact solution are both identified. Two sets of reproducible numerical experiments are conducted. The first, on a toy network, verifies the model and algorithm, and illustrates the differences between local and global stability. The second, on an expanded Sioux Falls network with 82 nodes and 748 links, derives generalizable insights about the model for coopetitive interdependencies between operators sharing the platform, handling congestion effects in MOD services, effects of local stability on investment impacts, and illustrating inequities that may arise under heterogeneous populations.","Mon, 1 May 2023 13:33:16 UTC (2,703 KB)"

In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving decentralized game-theoretic framework for resource crowdsourcing in MEC. Our framework models the interactions between a content provider (CP) and multiple mobile edge device users (MEDs) as a non-cooperative game, in which MEDs offer idle storage resources for content caching in exchange for rewards. We introduce efficient decentralized gradient play algorithms for Nash equilibrium (NE) computation by exchanging local information among neighboring MEDs only, thus preventing attackers from learning users' private information. The key challenge in designing such algorithms is that communication among MEDs is not fixed and is facilitated by a sequence of undirected time-varying graphs. Our approach achieves linear convergence to the NE without imposing any assumptions on the values of parameters in the local objective functions, such as requiring strong monotonicity to be stronger than its dependence on other MEDs' actions, which is commonly required in existing literature when the graph is directed time-varying. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient resource outsourcing decisions while preserving the privacy of the edge devices.","Wed, 26 Apr 2023 02:29:35 UTC (6,865 KB)"

However, there is no hard data on crimes that these games enable, ranging from assault to cyberstalking to grooming. Given these potential harms, we conduct a risk assessment and quasi-experiment on the game features of location-based games. Using PokemonGO as a case study, we identify and establish cyber-enabled stalking as the main risk event where in-game features such as an innocent function to share in-game postcards can be exploited by malicious users. Users obtain postcards that are unique to each Pokestop and represent gifts that can be shared with in-game friends. The number of postcards that each user can retain is limited, so they send the excess to their friends with items that boost their friends' game activities. The postcard often also unintentionally leaks the users' commonly visited locations to their in-game friends. We analyze these in-game features using risk assessment and identify cyber-enabled stalking as one of the main threats. We further evaluate the feasibility of this crime through a quasi-experiment. Our results show that participants' routine locations such as home and work can be reliably re-identified within days from the first gift exchange. This exploitation of a previously unconsidered in-game feature enables physical stalking of previously unknown persons which can escalate into more serious crimes. Given current data protection legislation in Europe, further preventive measures are required by Niantic to protect pseudonymized users from being re-identified by in-game features and (potentially) stalked.","Thu, 6 Apr 2023 09:22:25 UTC (9,146 KB)"

We develop an online convex programming technique for single-attack defense coordination, which not only allows adaptability to joint states but also identifies the maximal region of initial joint states that guarantees successful attack interception. Our defense allocation algorithm utilizes a hierarchical iterative method to approximate integer linear programs with a monotonicity constraint, reducing computational burden while ensuring enhanced defense performance over time.

Heemels, Mauro Salazar","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","Within mobility systems, the presence of self-interested users can lead to aggregate routing patterns that are far from the societal optimum which could be achieved by centrally controlling the users' choices. In this paper, we design a fair incentive mechanism to steer the selfish behavior of the users to align with the societally optimal aggregate routing. The proposed mechanism is based on an artificial currency that cannot be traded or bought, but only spent or received when traveling. Specifically, we consider a parallel-arc network with a single origin and destination node within a repeated game setting whereby each user chooses from one of the available arcs to reach their destination on a daily basis. In this framework, taking faster routes comes at a cost, whereas taking slower routes is incentivized by a reward. The users are thus playing against their future selves when choosing their present actions. To capture this complex behavior, we assume the users to be rational and to minimize an urgency-weighted combination of their immediate and future discomfort. To design the optimal pricing, we first derive a closed-form expression for the best individual response strategy. Second, we formulate the pricing design problem for each arc to achieve the societally optimal aggregate flows, and reformulate it so that it can be solved with gradient-free optimization methods. Our numerical simulations show that it is possible to achieve a near-optimal routing whilst significantly reducing the users' perceived discomfort when compared to a centralized optimal but urgency-unaware policy.","Wed, 29 Mar 2023 18:06:47 UTC (774 KB)"

Channel estimation is one of the most critical challenges for the realization of RIS-assisted communications. Non-parametric channel estimation techniques are inefficient due to the huge pilot dimensionality that stems from the large number of RIS elements. The challenge becomes more serious if we consider the mobility of the users where the channel needs to be re-estimated whenever the user moves to a new location. This paper develops a novel maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for jointly estimating the line-of-sight (LOS) channel from the user to the RIS and the direct channel between the user and the base station. By smartly refining the RIS configuration during the channel estimation procedure, we show that the channels can be accurately estimated with only a few pilot transmissions -- much fewer than the number of RIS elements. The proposed scheme is also shown to be capable of effectively tracking the channel when the user moves around in a continuous but non-stationary manner with varying LOS angles.","Wed, 29 Mar 2023 09:12:03 UTC (245 KB)"

In this zero-sum game, a Hider picks a point to hide on the tree and a Searcher picks a unit speed trajectory starting at the root. The payoff (to the Hider) is the search time. In Gal's model (and many subsequent investigations), the Searcher receives no additional information after the Hider chooses his location. In reality, the Searcher will often receive such locational information. For homeland security, mobile sensors on vehicles have been used to locate radioactive material stashed in an urban environment. In a military setting, mobile sensors can detect chemical signatures from land mines. In predator-prey search, the predator often has specially attuned senses (hearing for wolves, vision for eagles, smell for dogs, sonar for bats, pressure sensors for sharks) that may help it locate the prey. How can such noisy locational information be used by the Searcher to modify her route? We model such information as signals which indicate which of two branches of a binary tree should be searched first, where the signal has a known accuracy p<1. Our solution calculates which branch (at every branch node) is favored, meaning it should always be searched first when the signal is in that direction. When the signal is in the other direction, we calculate the probability the signal should be followed. Compared to the optimal Hider strategy in the classic search game of Gal, the Hider's optimal distribution for this model is more skewed towards leaf nodes that are further from the root.","Thu, 23 Mar 2023 15:47:20 UTC (69 KB)"

Menezes","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","We study a three-species cyclic model whose organisms are vulnerable to contamination with an infectious disease which propagates person-to-person. We consider that individuals of one species perform an evolutionary self-preservation strategy by reducing the mobility rate to minimise infection risk whenever an epidemic outbreak reaches the neighbourhood. Running stochastic simulations, we quantify the changes in spatial patterns induced by unevenness in the cyclic game introduced by the mobility restriction strategy of organisms of one out of the species. Our findings show that variations in disease virulence impact the benefits of dispersal limitation reaction, with the relative reduction of the organisms' infection risk accentuating in surges of less contagious or deadlier diseases. The effectiveness of the mobility restriction tactic depends on the tolerable fraction of infected neighbours used as a trigger of the defensive strategy and the deceleration level. If each organism promptly reacts to the arrival of the first viral vectors in its surroundings with strict mobility reduction, contamination risk decreases significantly. Our conclusions may help biologists understand the impact of evolutionary defensive strategies in ecosystems during an epidemic.","Sun, 19 Mar 2023 17:43:28 UTC (3,423 KB)"

Connectivity can be a game-changer for some of the world's most marginalized children. However, while legislatures around the world have enacted regulations to protect children's online privacy, and app stores have instituted various protections, privacy in mobile apps remains a growing concern for parents and wider society. In this paper, we explore the potential privacy issues and threats that exist in these apps. We investigate 20,195 mobile apps from the Google Play store that are designed particularly for children (Family apps) or include children in their target user groups (Normal apps). Using both static and dynamic analysis, we find that 4.47% of Family apps request location permissions, even though collecting location information from children is forbidden by the Play store, and 81.25% of Family apps use trackers (which are not allowed in children's apps). Even major developers with 40+ kids apps on the Play store use ad trackers. Furthermore, we find that most permission request notifications are not well designed for children, and 19.25% apps have inconsistent content age ratings across the different protection authorities.

Rangel","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","We study the spatial rock-paper-scissors model, where resource competitors' cyclic dominance impacts organisms' energy levels. Our model assumes that failed selection interactions can lead to energy loss, reducing the chances of success in the spatial game and hastening decline. To prevent death by energy insufficiency, organisms of one out of the species strategically perform a trade-off between reproduction and mobility. When prioritising exploring more extensive areas, organisms aim to maximise the chances of acquiring resources to regain high energy levels. Through simulation, we examine the effect of survival behaviour on species segregation and spatial patterns. Our outcomes show that the trade-off between offspring generation and accelerated movement effectively protects individuals from death due to lack of energy. Moreover, the risk of being eliminated by an enemy in the cyclic game reduces due to the behavioural strategy. Considering a three-state model, we quantify how the trade-off parameter controls the organisms' energy recovery. Computing the median organisms' survival time, we find that although individuals performing the trade-off strategy may live longer, the organisms of other species are negatively affected by a life expectancy reduction.

However, designing scalable autonomous fleet coordination schemes to accommodate fast-growing mobility systems is challenging primarily due to the increasing heterogeneity of the fleets, time-varying demand patterns, service area expansions, and communication limitations. We introduce the concept of partially observable advanced air mobility games to coordinate a fleet of aerial vehicles by accounting for the heterogeneity of the interacting agents and the self-interested nature inherent to commercial mobility fleets. To model the complex interactions among the agents and the observation uncertainty in the mobility networks, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph attention encoder-decoder (HetGAT Enc-Dec) neural network-based stochastic policy. We train the policy by leveraging deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, allowing decentralized decision-making for the agents using their local observations. Through extensive experimentation, we show that the learned policy generalizes to various fleet compositions, demand patterns, and observation topologies. Further, fleets operating under the HetGAT Enc-Dec policy outperform other state-of-the-art graph neural network policies by achieving the highest fleet reward and fulfillment ratios in on-demand mobility networks.","Tue, 14 Feb 2023 20:48:00 UTC (1,456 KB)[v2] Thu, 16 Feb 2023 18:09:30 UTC (1,456 KB)[v3] Tue, 1 Aug 2023 19:36:57 UTC (3,608 KB)"

A real-time bidding (RTB) system is rapidly becoming the most popular method to buy and sell online advertising impressions. Within the RTB system, demand-side platforms (DSP) aim to spend advertisers' campaign budgets efficiently while maximizing profit, seeking impressions that result in high user responses, such as clicks or installs. In the current study, we investigate the process of predicting a mobile gaming app installation from the point of view of a particular DSP, while paying attention to user privacy, and exploring the trade-off between privacy preservation and model performance. There are multiple levels of potential threats to user privacy, depending on the privacy leaks associated with the data-sharing process, such as data transformation or de-anonymization. To address these concerns, privacy-preserving techniques were proposed, such as cryptographic approaches, for training privacy-aware machine-learning models. However, the ability to train a mobile gaming app installation prediction model without using user-level data, can prevent these threats and protect the users' privacy, even though the model's ability to predict may be impaired. Additionally, current laws might force companies to declare that they are collecting data, and might even give the user the option to opt out of such data collection, which might threaten companies' business models in digital advertising, which are dependent on the collection and use of user-level data. We conclude that privacy-aware models might still preserve significant capabilities, enabling companies to make better decisions, dependent on the privacy-efficacy trade-off utility function of each case.","Tue, 7 Feb 2023 09:14:59 UTC (710 KB)[v2] Tue, 28 Mar 2023 08:09:27 UTC (711 KB)"

By (visually) transporting users from the real or physical world to exciting and realistic virtual spaces, VR systems can enable true-to-life and more interactive versions of traditional applications such as gaming, remote conferencing, social networking and virtual tourism. However, as with any new consumer technology, VR applications also present significant user-privacy challenges. This paper studies a new type of privacy attack targeting VR users by connecting their activities visible in the virtual world (enabled by some VR application/service) to their physical state sensed in the real world. Specifically, this paper analyzes the feasibility of carrying out a de-anonymization or identification attack on VR users by correlating visually observed movements of users' avatars in the virtual world with some auxiliary data (e.g., motion sensor data from mobile/wearable devices held by users) representing their context/state in the physical world. To enable this attack, this paper proposes a novel framework which first employs a learning-based activity classification approach to translate the disparate visual movement data and motion sensor data into an activity-vector to ease comparison, followed by a filtering and identity ranking phase outputting an ordered list of potential identities corresponding to the target visual movement data. Extensive empirical evaluation of the proposed framework, under a comprehensive set of experimental settings, demonstrates the feasibility of such a de-anonymization attack.","Sun, 22 Jan 2023 02:50:05 UTC (6,566 KB)"

To this end, we consider a multimodal transportation network, where a ride-hailing platform operates a fleet of AVs to offer mobility-on-demand services in competition with a public transit agency that offers transit services on a transportation network. A game-theoretic model is developed to characterize the intimate interactions between the ride-hailing platform, the transit agency, and multiclass passengers with distinct income levels. An algorithm is proposed to compute the Nash equilibrium of the game and conduct an ex-post evaluation of the performance of the obtained solution. Based on the proposed framework, we evaluate the spatial and social equity in transport accessibility using the Theil index, and find that although the proliferation of for-hire AVs in the ride-hailing network improves overall accessibility, the benefits are not fairly distributed among distinct locations or population groups, implying that the deployment of AVs will enlarge the existing spatial and social inequity gaps in the transportation network if no regulatory intervention is in place. To address this concern, we investigate two regulatory policies that can improve transport equity: (a) a minimum service-level requirement on ride-hailing services, which improves the spatial equity in the transport network; (b) a subsidy on transit services by taxing ride-hailing services, which promotes the use of public transit and improves the spatial and social equity of the transport network. We show that the minimum service-level requirement entails a trade-off: as a higher minimum service level is imposed, the spatial inequity reduces, but the social inequity will be exacerbated.

The problem of learning such simulations is called predictive world modeling. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) agents leveraging world models have achieved SOTA performance in game environments. However, understanding how to apply the world modeling approach in complex real-world environments relevant to mobile robots remains an open question. In this paper, we present a framework for learning a probabilistic predictive world model for real-world road environments. We implement the model using a hierarchical VAE (HVAE) capable of predicting a diverse set of fully observed plausible worlds from accumulated sensor observations. While prior HVAE methods require complete states as ground truth for learning, we present a novel sequential training method to allow HVAEs to learn to predict complete states from partially observed states only. We experimentally demonstrate accurate spatial structure prediction of deterministic regions achieving 96.21 IoU, and close the gap to perfect prediction by 62% for stochastic regions using the best prediction. By extending HVAEs to cases where complete ground truth states do not exist, we facilitate continual learning of spatial prediction as a step towards realizing explainable and comprehensive predictive world models for real-world mobile robotics applications.

Rangel","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","We run stochastic simulations of the spatial version of the rock-paper-scissors game, considering that individuals use sensory abilities to scan the environment to detect the presence of enemies. If the local dangerousness level is above a tolerable threshold, individuals aggregate instead of moving randomly on the lattice. We study the impact of the locally adaptive aggregation on the organisms' spatial organisation by measuring the characteristic length scale of the spatial domains occupied by organisms of a single species. Our results reveal that aggregation is beneficial if triggered when the local density of opponents does not exceed $30\%$; otherwise, the behavioural strategy may harm individuals by increasing the average death risk. We show that if organisms can perceive further distances, they can accurately scan and interpret the signals from the neighbourhood, maximising the effects of the locally adaptive aggregation on the death risk. Finally, we show that the locally adaptive aggregation behaviour promotes biodiversity independently of the organism's mobility. The coexistence probability rises if organisms join conspecifics, even in the presence of a small number of enemies. We verify that our conclusions hold for more complex systems by simulating the generalised rock-paper-scissors models with five and seven species. Our discoveries may be helpful to ecologists in understanding systems where organisms' self-defence behaviour adapts to local environmental cues.","Wed, 4 Jan 2023 17:53:58 UTC (2,375 KB)"

However, a fully centralized RL approach is beset with difficulties in a multi-network scenario because of exponential growth in state-action space with increasing intersections. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can overcome the high-dimension problem by employing the global control of each local RL agent, but it also brings new challenges, such as the failure of convergence caused by the non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we introduce an off-policy nash deep Q-Network (OPNDQN) algorithm, which mitigates the weakness of both fully centralized and MARL approaches. The OPNDQN algorithm solves the problem that traditional algorithms cannot be used in large state-action space traffic models by utilizing a fictitious game approach at each iteration to find the nash equilibrium among neighboring intersections, from which no intersection has incentive to unilaterally deviate. One of main advantages of OPNDQN is to mitigate the non-stationarity of multi-agent Markov process because it considers the mutual influence among neighboring intersections by sharing their actions. On the other hand, for training a large traffic network, the convergence rate of OPNDQN is higher than that of existing MARL approaches because it does not incorporate all state information of each agent. We conduct an extensive experiments by using Simulation of Urban MObility simulator (SUMO), and show the dominant superiority of OPNDQN over several existing MARL approaches in terms of average queue length, episode training reward and average waiting time.","Mon, 2 Jan 2023 12:58:51 UTC (4,984 KB)"

Despite the potential benefits of AR in poker, not much research has been done in the field. In fact, PokAR is the first application to enable AR poker on a mobile device without requiring extra costly equipment. This has been done by creating a Snapchat Lens which can be used on most mobile devices. We evaluated this application by instructing 4 participant dyads to use PokAR to engage in poker play and respond to survey questions about their experience. We found that most PokAR features were positively received, AR did not significantly improve nor hinder socialization, PokAR slightly increased the game pace, and participants had an overall enjoyable experience with the Lens. These findings led to three major conclusions: (1) AR has the potential to augment and simplify traditional table games, (2) AR should not be used to replace traditional experiences, only augment them, (3) Future work includes additional features like increased tactility and statistical annotations.","Mon, 2 Jan 2023 02:32:26 UTC (4,031 KB)"

Peñaherrera-Pulla, Raquel Barco, Sergio Fortes","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","User equipment is one of the main bottlenecks facing the gaming industry nowadays. The extremely realistic games which are currently available trigger high computational requirements of the user devices to run games. As a consequence, the game industry has proposed the concept of Cloud Gaming, a paradigm that improves gaming experience in reduced hardware devices. To this end, games are hosted on remote servers, relegating users' devices to play only the role of a peripheral for interacting with the game. However, this paradigm overloads the communication links connecting the users with the cloud. Therefore, service experience becomes highly dependent on network connectivity. To overcome this, Cloud Gaming will be boosted by the promised performance of 5G and future 6G networks, together with the flexibility provided by mobility in multi-RAT scenarios, such as WiFi. In this scope, the present work proposes a framework for measuring and estimating the main E2E metrics of the Cloud Gaming service, namely KQIs. In addition, different machine learning techniques are assessed for predicting KQIs related to Cloud Gaming user's experience. To this end, the main key quality indicators (KQIs) of the service such as input lag, freeze percent or perceived video frame rate are collected in a real environment. Based on these, results show that machine learning techniques provide a good estimation of these indicators solely from network-based metrics. This is considered a valuable asset to guide the delivery of Cloud Gaming services through cellular communications networks even without access to the user's device, as it is expected for telecom operators.","Wed, 28 Dec 2022 19:22:39 UTC (1,494 KB)"

To this end, we propose a new form of edge server, namely SoC-Cluster, that orchestrates many low-power mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) through an on-chip network. For the first time, we have developed a concrete SoC-Cluster server that consists of 60 Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoCs in a 2U rack. Such a server has been commercialized successfully and deployed in large scale on edge clouds. The current dominant workload on those deployed SoC-Clusters is cloud gaming, as mobile SoCs can seamlessly run native mobile games. The primary goal of this work is to demystify whether SoC-Cluster can efficiently serve more general-purpose, edge-typical workloads. Therefore, we built a benchmark suite that leverages state-of-the-art libraries for two killer edge workloads, i.e., video transcoding and deep learning inference. The benchmark comprehensively reports the performance, power consumption, and other application-specific metrics. We then performed a thorough measurement study and directly compared SoC-Cluster with traditional edge servers (with Intel CPU and NVIDIA GPU) with respect to physical size, electricity, and billing. The results reveal the advantages of SoC-Cluster, especially its high energy efficiency and the ability to proportionally scale energy consumption with various incoming loads, as well as its limitations. The results also provide insightful implications and valuable guidance to further improve SoC-Cluster and land it in broader edge scenarios.","Sun, 25 Dec 2022 02:42:46 UTC (1,689 KB)"

This may result in societal costs that are significantly higher compared to what could be achieved by a centralized system-optimal controller. Monetary tolling schemes can effectively align the behavior of selfish users with the system-optimum. Yet, they inevitably discriminate the population in terms of income. Artificial currencies were recently presented as an effective alternative that can achieve the same performance, whilst guaranteeing fairness among the population. However, those studies were based on behavioral models that may differ from practical implementations. This paper presents a data-driven approach to automatically adapt artificial-currency tolls within repetitive-game settings. We first consider a parallel-arc setting whereby users commute on a daily basis from an individual origin to an individual destination, choosing a route in exchange of an artificial-currency price or reward, while accounting for the impact of the choices of the other users on travel discomfort. Second, we devise a model-based reinforcement learning controller that autonomously learns the optimal pricing policy by interacting with the proposed framework considering the closeness of the observed aggregate flows to a desired system-optimal distribution as a reward function. Our numerical results show that the proposed data-driven pricing scheme can effectively align the users' flows with the system optimum, significantly reducing the societal costs with respect to the uncontrolled flows (by about 15% and 25% depending on the scenario), and respond to environmental changes in a robust and efficient manner.","Sun, 27 Nov 2022 11:23:29 UTC (127 KB)[v2] Thu, 25 May 2023 13:04:53 UTC (127 KB)"

However, it is difficult to obtain time-varying traffic conditions, and emerging crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Waze and Google Maps) provide a convenient way for mobile users travelling on the paths to learn and share the traffic conditions over time. When congestion games meet mobile crowdsourcing, it is critical to incentive selfish users to change their myopic routing policy and reach the best exploitation-exploration trade-off. By considering a simple but fundamental parallel routing network with one deterministic path and multiple stochastic paths for atomic users, we prove that the myopic routing policy's price of anarchy (PoA) is larger than $\frac{1}{1-\rho}$, which can be arbitrarily large as discount factor $\rho\rightarrow1$. To remedy such huge efficiency loss, we propose a selective information disclosure (SID) mechanism: we only reveal the latest traffic information to users when they intend to over-explore the stochastic paths, while hiding such information when they want to under-explore. We prove that our mechanism reduces PoA to be less than $\frac{1}{1-\frac{\rho}{2}}$. Besides the worst-case performance, we further examine our mechanism's average-case performance by using extensive simulations.","Fri, 25 Nov 2022 11:03:54 UTC (114 KB)[v2] Sun, 12 Feb 2023 10:25:38 UTC (114 KB)"

Projections of energy futures, however, are met with diverging assumptions on its scale and pace, causing disagreement among IOC decision-makers and their stakeholders over what the business model of an incumbent fossil fuel company should be. In this work, we used deep multi-agent reinforcement learning to solve an energy systems wargame wherein players simulate IOC decision-making, including hydrocarbon and low-carbon investments decisions, dividend policies, and capital structure measures, through an uncertain energy transition to explore critical and non-linear governance questions, from leveraged transitions to reserve replacements. Adversarial play facilitated by state-of-the-art algorithms revealed decision-making strategies robust to energy transition uncertainty and against multiple IOCs. In all games, robust strategies emerged in the form of low-carbon business models as a result of early transition-oriented movement. IOCs adopting such strategies outperformed business-as-usual and delayed transition strategies regardless of hydrocarbon demand projections. In addition to maximizing value, these strategies benefit greater society by contributing substantial amounts of capital necessary to accelerate the global low-carbon energy transition. Our findings point towards the need for lenders and investors to effectively mobilize transition-oriented finance and engage with IOCs to ensure responsible reallocation of capital towards low-carbon business models that would enable the emergence of fossil fuel incumbents as future low-carbon leaders.","Sun, 20 Nov 2022 17:52:59 UTC (25,022 KB)"

Low/medium interaction honeypots offer a promising lightweight defense for actively protecting mobile Internet of things, particularly UAV networks. While previous research has primarily focused on honeypot system design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAV's participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks remains unexplored. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive design, in the presence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs and the network operator under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. The optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry is then solved using a contract-theoretic approach that ensures budget feasibility, truthfulness, fairness, and computational efficiency. In addition, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the time-varying UAV network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV's cooperation in VDD sharing and improve defensive effectiveness, compared with conventional schemes.","Sat, 29 Oct 2022 01:48:32 UTC (2,981 KB)[v2] Wed, 30 Aug 2023 02:59:44 UTC (3,104 KB)"

In this work, we present a hierarchical, game-based, control mechanism for balancing the simultaneous charging of multiple ride-hailing fleets. The mechanism takes into account sometimes conflicting interests of the ride-hailing drivers, the ride-hailing company management, and the external agents such as power-providing companies or city governments that will play a significant role in charging management in the future. The upper-level control considers charging price incentives and models the interactions between the external agents and ride-hailing companies as a Reverse Stackelberg game with a single leader and multiple followers. The lower-level control motivates the revenue-maximizing drivers to follow the company operator's requests through surge pricing and models the interactions as a single leader, multiple followers Stackelberg game. We provide a pricing mechanism that ensures the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium of the upper-level game that minimizes the external agent's objective at the same time. We provide theoretical and experimental robustness analysis of the upper-level control with respect to parameters whose values depend on sensitive information that might not be entirely accessible to the external agent. For the lower-level algorithm, we combine the Nash equilibrium of the upper-level game with a quadratic mixed integer optimization problem to find the optimal surge prices.

Low/medium-interaction honeypot is regarded as a promising lightweight defense to actively protect mobile Internet of things, especially UAV networks. Existing works primarily focused on honeypot design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAVs' participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks is still under-explored. This paper proposes a novel game-based collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive mechanism design, in the presence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. We then devise a contract-theoretic method to solve the optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry, while ensuring truthfulness, fairness, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a reinforcement learning based distributed method to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the fast-changing network. Experimental simulations show that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV's collaboration in VDD sharing and enhance defensive effectiveness, compared with existing solutions.","Wed, 28 Sep 2022 03:40:06 UTC (792 KB)"

Recently, the SereTOD challenge is organized and releases the MobileCS dataset, which consists of real-world dialog transcripts between real users and customer-service staffs from China Mobile. Based on the MobileCS dataset, the SereTOD challenge has two tasks, not only evaluating the construction of the dialogue system itself, but also examining information extraction from dialog transcripts, which is crucial for building the knowledge base for TOD. This paper mainly presents a baseline study of the two tasks with the MobileCS dataset. We introduce how the two baselines are constructed, the problems encountered, and the results. We anticipate that the baselines can facilitate exciting future research to build human-robot dialogue systems for real-life tasks.","Tue, 27 Sep 2022 15:30:43 UTC (174 KB)[v2] Tue, 18 Oct 2022 06:15:28 UTC (168 KB)"

Lyu","Software Engineering (cs.SE)","Mobile apps are becoming an integral part of people's daily life by providing various functionalities, such as messaging and gaming. App developers try their best to ensure user experience during app development and maintenance to improve the rating of their apps on app platforms and attract more user downloads. Previous studies indicated that responding to users' reviews tends to change their attitude towards the apps positively. Users who have been replied are more likely to update the given ratings. However, reading and responding to every user review is not an easy task for developers since it is common for popular apps to receive tons of reviews every day. Thus, automation tools for review replying are needed. To address the need above, the paper introduces a Transformer-based approach, named TRRGen, to automatically generate responses to given user reviews. TRRGen extracts apps' categories, rating, and review text as the input features. By adapting a Transformer-based model, TRRGen can generate appropriate replies for new reviews. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on the real-world datasets indicate that the proposed approach can generate high-quality replies for users' reviews and significantly outperform current state-of-art approaches on the task. The manual validation results on the generated replies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Thu, 15 Sep 2022 11:20:06 UTC (1,553 KB)[v2] Sun, 25 Sep 2022 14:36:11 UTC (1,555 KB)"

However, proper financial incentives need to be in place to enlist EV drivers to provide services to the grid. In this paper, we consider two types of EV drivers who may be willing to provide mobile storage service using their EVs: commuters taking a fixed route, and on-demand EV drivers who receive incentives from a transportation network company (TNC) and are willing to take any route. We model the behavior of each type of driver using game theoretic methods, and characterize the Nash equilibrium (NE) of an EV battery sharing game where each EV driver withdraws power from the grid to charge its EV battery at the origin of a route, travels from the origin to the destination, and then discharges power back to the grid at the destination of the route. The driver earns a payoff that depends on the participation of other drivers and power network conditions. We characterize the NE in three situations: when there are only commuters, when there are only on-demand TNC drivers, and when the two groups of drivers co-exist. In particular, we show that the equilibrium outcome supports the social welfare in each of these three cases.","Wed, 14 Sep 2022 07:30:22 UTC (1,698 KB)[v2] Fri, 16 Dec 2022 19:41:41 UTC (1,749 KB)"

However, interactive multimedia applications (e.g., ultra high definition video conferencing, 3D and multiview video streaming, crowd-sourced video streaming, cloud gaming, virtual and augmented reality) are becoming more ambitious with high volume and low latency video streams putting strict demands on the already congested networks. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network i.e., at the base station level. To meet the latency requirements and avoid the end-to-end communication with remote cloud data centers, MEC allows to store and process video content (e.g., caching, transcoding, pre-processing) at the base stations. Both video on demand and live video streaming can utilize MEC to improve existing services and develop novel use cases, such as video analytics, and targeted advertisements. MEC is expected to reshape the future of video streaming by providing ultra-reliable and low latency streaming (e.g., in augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles), pervasive computing (e.g., in real-time video analytics), and blockchain-enabled architecture for secure live streaming. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent developments in MEC-enabled video streaming bringing unprecedented improvement to enable novel use cases. A detailed review of the state-of-the-art is presented covering novel caching schemes, optimal computation offloading, cooperative caching and offloading and the use of artificial intelligence (i.e., machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning) in MEC-assisted video streaming services.","Tue, 13 Sep 2022 06:53:32 UTC (9,136 KB)"

This work considers vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only its own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the game composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely uncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making algorithm presented in \cite{Cho2021} for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent solution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost variations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework where each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice adapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According to the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual perturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure a certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the actual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the correspondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of agents.","Sat, 3 Sep 2022 07:55:48 UTC (1,134 KB)[v2] Sat, 20 May 2023 18:55:08 UTC (1,117 KB)"

These apps are named as underground economy apps, or UEware for short. As most UEware do not have malicious payloads, traditional malware detection approaches are ineffective to perform the detection. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to effectively and efficiently detect UEware by considering the transition orders of the user interfaces (UIs), which determine the usage scenarios of these apps. Based on the proposed approach, we design a system named DeUEDroid to detect the UEware via scene graph. To evaluate DeUEDroid, we collect 26, 591 apps to evaluate DeUEDroid and build up the first large-scale ground-truth UEware dataset (1, 720 underground economy apps and 831 legitimate apps). The evaluation result shows that DeUEDroid can construct scene graph accurately, and achieve the accuracy scores of 77.70% on the five-classification task (i.e., gambling game, porn, financial scam, miscellaneous, and legitimate apps), reaching obvious improvements over the SOTA approaches. Running further on 24, 017 apps, DeUEDroid performs well in the real-world scenario to mitigate the threat. Specifically, by using DeUEDroid, we found that UEware are prevalent, i.e., 61% apps in the wild and 21% apps in the app stores are UEware (with over 72% accuracy after the manual investigation). We will release our dataset and system to engage the community after been accepted.","Sat, 3 Sep 2022 03:36:41 UTC (8,802 KB)"

(2) What: Agents augment message contents with wireless network measurements to better select the game and communication actions. (3) How: Agents use a novel neural message encoder to preserve all information from received messages, regardless of the number and order of messages.

Rangel","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","We study a three-species cyclic game system where organisms face a contagious disease whose virulence may change by a pathogen mutation. As a responsive defence strategy, organisms' mobility is restricted to reduce disease dissemination in the system. The impact of the collective self-preservation strategy on the disease infection risk is investigated by performing stochastic simulations of the spatial version of the rock-paper-scissors game. Our outcomes show that the mobility control strategy induces plasticity in the spatial patterns with groups of organisms of the same species inhabiting spatial domains whose characteristic length scales depend on the level of dispersal restrictions. The spatial organisation plasticity allows the ecosystems to adapt to minimise the individuals' disease contamination risk if an eventual pathogen alters the disease virulence. We discover that if a pathogen mutation makes the disease more transmissible or less lethal, the organisms benefit more if the mobility is not strongly restricted, thus forming large spatial domains. Conversely, the benefits of protecting against a pathogen causing a less contagious or deadlier disease are maximised if the average size of groups of individuals of the same species is significantly limited, reducing the dimensions of groups of organisms significantly. Our findings may help biologists understand the effects of dispersal control as a conservation strategy in ecosystems affected by epidemic outbreaks.","Thu, 1 Sep 2022 16:55:14 UTC (2,094 KB)"
"126","Neuroevolution-Based Generation of Tests and Oracles for Games","Patric Feldmeier, Gordon Fraser","Software Engineering (cs.SE)","Game-like programs have become increasingly popular in many software engineering domains such as mobile apps, web applications, or programming education. However, creating tests for programs that have the purpose of challenging human players is a daunting task for automatic test generators. Even if test generation succeeds in finding a relevant sequence of events to exercise a program, the randomized nature of games means that it may neither be possible to reproduce the exact program behavior underlying this sequence, nor to create test assertions checking if observed randomized game behavior is correct. To overcome these problems, we propose Neatest, a novel test generator based on the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. Neatest systematically explores a program's statements, and creates neural networks that operate the program in order to reliably reach each statement -- that is, Neatest learns to play the game in a way to reliably cover different parts of the code. As the networks learn the actual game behavior, they can also serve as test oracles by evaluating how surprising the observed behavior of a program under test is compared to a supposedly correct version of the program. We evaluate this approach in the context of Scratch, an educational programming environment. Our empirical study on 25 non-trivial Scratch games demonstrates that our approach can successfully train neural networks that are not only far more resilient to random influences than traditional test suites consisting of static input sequences, but are also highly effective with an average mutation score of more than 65%.","Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:27:21 UTC (1,689 KB)"

In many such recommendation scenarios, contexts are drifting over time. For example, in a mobile game recommendation, contextual features like locations, battery, and storage levels of mobile devices are frequently drifting over time. However, most existing graph-based collaborative filtering methods are designed under the assumption of static features. Therefore, they would require frequent retraining and/or yield graphical models burgeoning in sizes, impeding their suitability for context-drifting recommendations. In this work, we propose a specifically tailor-made Hybrid Static and Adaptive Graph Embedding (HySAGE) network for context-drifting recommendations. Our key idea is to disentangle the relatively static user-item interaction and rapidly drifting contextual features. Specifically, our proposed HySAGE network learns a relatively static graph embedding from user-item interaction and an adaptive embedding from drifting contextual features. These embeddings are incorporated into an interest network to generate the user interest in some certain context. We adopt an interactive attention module to learn the interactions among static graph embeddings, adaptive contextual embeddings, and user interest, helping to achieve a better final representation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HySAGE significantly improves the performance of the existing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.","Sat, 20 Aug 2022 03:11:24 UTC (2,932 KB)"

Most of the matchmaking systems largely rely on precise estimation of players' game skills to construct equitable games. However, the skill rating of a novice is usually inaccurate, as current matchmaking rating algorithms require considerable amount of games for learning the true skill of a new player. Using these unreliable skill scores at early stages for matchmaking usually leads to disparities in terms of team performance, which causes negative game experience. This is known as the ''cold-start'' problem for matchmaking rating algorithms. To overcome this conundrum, this paper proposes QuickSKill, a deep learning based novice skill estimation framework to quickly probe abilities of new players in online multiplayer games. QuickSKill extracts sequential performance features from initial few games of a player to predict his/her future skill rating with a dedicated neural network, thus delivering accurate skill estimation at the player's early game stage. By employing QuickSKill for matchmaking, game fairness can be dramatically improved in the initial cold-start period. We conduct experiments in a popular mobile multiplayer game in both offline and online scenarios. Results obtained with two real-world anonymized gaming datasets demonstrate that proposed QuickSKill delivers precise estimation of game skills for novices, leading to significantly lower team skill disparities and better player game experience. To the best of our knowledge, proposed QuickSKill is the first framework that tackles the cold-start problem for traditional skill rating algorithms.","Mon, 15 Aug 2022 11:59:05 UTC (1,275 KB)"

However, live streaming might miss critical highlight moments in the game, including kills and tactics. We identify how and why the live streaming team fails to capture highlight moments to reduce such live streaming mistakes. We named such mistakes jarring observations. We conducted a field study of live streaming competitions of Game For Peace, a popular FPS mobile game, to summarize five typical jarring observations and identify three primary reasons that caused the issues. We further studied how to improve the live streaming system to prevent jarring observations from happening by doing semi-structured interviews with two professional streaming teams for Game For Peace. The study showed that a better system should (1) add a new sub-team role to share the director's responsibility of managing observers; (2) provide interfaces customized for three roles of live streamers in the team; (3) abstract more geographical info; (4) predict the priority of observation targets; and (5) provide non-verbal interfaces for sync-up between sub-teams.

We consider heterogeneous commuters traveling through a single bottleneck that differ in both the desired arrival time and Value of Time (VOT). We consider a generalized notion of VOT by allowing it to vary dynamically on each day (e.g., according to trip purpose and urgency), rather than being a static characteristic of each individual. In our CARMA scheme, the bottleneck is divided into a fast lane that is kept in free flow and a slow lane that is subject to congestion. We introduce a non-tradable mobility credit, named karma, that is used by commuters to bid for access to the fast lane. Commuters who get outbid or do not participate in the CARMA scheme instead use the slow lane. At the end of each day, karma collected from the bidders is redistributed, and the process repeats day by day. We model the collective commuter behaviors under CARMA as a Dynamic Population Game (DPG), in which a Stationary Nash Equilibrium (SNE) is guaranteed to exist. Unlike existing monetary schemes, CARMA is demonstrated, both analytically and numerically, to achieve a) an equitable traffic assignment with respect to heterogeneous income classes and b) a strong Pareto improvement in the long-term average travel disutility with respect to no policy intervention. With extensive numerical analysis, we show that CARMA is able to retain the same congestion reduction as an optimal monetary tolling scheme under uniform karma redistribution and even outperform tolling under a well-designed redistribution scheme. We also highlight the privacy-preserving feature of CARMA, i.e., its ability to tailor to the private preferences of commuters without centrally collecting the information.","Mon, 15 Aug 2022 10:53:02 UTC (1,935 KB)[v2] Mon, 18 Sep 2023 06:42:42 UTC (5,947 KB)"

This aspect has been studied intensively in social dilemmas where competing players' individual and collective interests are in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where players are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are present, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change their positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly, these so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain their permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly. Hence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by its neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly biased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of parameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher cooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population density, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the presence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern changes slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow. In this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called Moor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they subsequentially transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence, paradoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a higher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be isolated otherwise.","Wed, 10 Aug 2022 08:29:59 UTC (7,195 KB)[v2] Mon, 12 Sep 2022 07:06:06 UTC (7,195 KB)"

Here, due to the specifics of the application, it is not generally possible to perform long pre-training, as it is commonly done in off-line, model-free approaches, which are akin to dynamic programming. Such applications may be found more frequently in industry, rather than in pure digital fields, such as cloud services, video games, database management, etc., where reinforcement learning has been demonstrating success. Online reinforcement learning, in contrast, is more akin to classical control, which utilizes some model knowledge about the environment. Stability of the closed-loop (agent plus the environment) is a major challenge for such online approaches. In this paper, we tackle this problem by a special fusion of online reinforcement learning with elements of classical control, namely, based on the Lyapunov theory of stability. The idea is to start the agent at once, without pre-training, and learn approximately optimal policy under specially designed constraints, which guarantee stability. The resulting approach was tested in an extensive experimental study with a mobile robot. A nominal parking controller was used as a baseline. It was observed that the suggested agent could always successfully park the robot, while significantly improving the cost. While many approaches may be exploited for mobile robot control, we suggest that the experiments showed the promising potential of online reinforcement learning agents based on Lyapunov-like constraints. The presented methodology may be utilized in safety-critical, industrial applications where stability is necessary.","Mon, 18 Jul 2022 16:23:26 UTC (16 KB)[v2] Thu, 28 Jul 2022 13:19:51 UTC (136 KB)[v3] Mon, 1 Aug 2022 17:19:11 UTC (137 KB)[v4] Tue, 2 Aug 2022 12:38:48 UTC (17 KB)[v5] Sun, 21 Aug 2022 14:58:05 UTC (18 KB)[v6] Fri, 26 Aug 2022 21:21:56 UTC (18 KB)[v7] Tue, 20 Sep 2022 17:57:29 UTC (80 KB)[v8] Tue, 8 Nov 2022 19:56:51 UTC (2,675 KB)[v9] Wed, 16 Nov 2022 15:31:45 UTC (2,684 KB)"

To expand on this point, we study one such scenario from the perspective of game theory, considering a mobile mmWave receiver and an adversary interacting strategically as players in a zero-sum game, where they want to maximize, or respectively minimize, the spectral efficiency of the communication. To do so, the adversary attempts at screening the receiver's line of sight as an obstacle, while the receiver can move around so as to avoid the blockage. We consider preset distances and the choices available to the players are to change their angular coordinates to go around each other. This is framed as a static game of complete information, for which we numerically find the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies, drawing some interesting conclusions such as connecting it with the beamforming pattern of the transmitter.","Fri, 10 Jun 2022 07:41:09 UTC (44 KB)"

The MRs operate in the full-duplex (FD) mode to achieve high spectrum utilization. We formulate the problem of minimizing the average task execution latency of all users, under local device and MRs energy consumption constraints. We propose a joint resource allocation and computation offloading scheme (JRACO) to solve the problem. It consists of a resource allocation and computation offloading (RACO) algorithm and an MR Energy constraint algorithm. RACO utilizes the matching game theory to iterate between two subproblems, i.e., data segmentation and user association and sub-channel allocation. With the RACO results, the MR energy constraint algorithm ensures that the MR energy consumption constraint is satisfied. Extensive simulations validate that JRACO can effectively reduce the average latency and increase the number of served users compared with three baseline schemes.","Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:10:08 UTC (1,379 KB)"

Lenia can be viewed as a continuously-valued generalization of the Game of Life, a seminal cellular automaton developed by John Conway that exhibits complex and universal behavior based on simple birth and survival rules. Life's framework of totalistic CA based on the Moore neighborhood includes many other interesting, Life-like, CA. A simplification introduced in Lenia limits the types of Life-like CA that are expressible in Lenia to a specific subset. This work recovers the ability to easily implement any Life-like CA by splitting Lenia's growth function into genesis and persistence functions, analogous to Life's birth and survival rules. We demonstrate the capabilities of this new CA variant by implementing a puffer pattern from Life-like CA Morley/Move, and examine differences between related CA in Lenia and Glaberish frameworks: Hydrogeminium natans and s613, respectively. These CA exhibit marked differences in dynamics and character based on spatial entropy over time, and both support several persistent mobile patterns. The CA s613, implemented in the Glaberish framework, is more dynamic than the Hydrogeminium CA in terms of a consistently high variance in spatial entropy over time. These results suggest there may be a wide variety of interesting CA that can be implemented in the Glaberish variant of the Lenia framework, analogous to the many interesting Life-like CA outside of Conway's Life.","Fri, 20 May 2022 23:41:40 UTC (1,497 KB)"
"140","Energy-Delay Minimization of Task Migration Based on Game Theory in MEC-assisted Vehicular Networks","Haipeng Wang, Tiejun Lv, Zhipeng Lin, Jie Zeng","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","Roadside units (RSUs), which have strong computing capability and are close to vehicle nodes, have been widely used to process delay- and computation-intensive tasks of vehicle nodes. However, due to their high mobility, vehicles may drive out of the coverage of RSUs before receiving the task processing results. In this paper, we propose a mobile edge computing-assisted vehicular network, where vehicles can offload their tasks to a nearby vehicle via a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link or a nearby RSU via a vehicle-to-infrastructure link. These tasks are also migrated by a V2V link or an infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I) link to avoid the scenario where the vehicles cannot receive the processed task from the RSUs. Considering mutual interference from the same link of offloading tasks and migrating tasks, we construct a vehicle offloading decision-based game to minimize the computation overhead. We prove that the game can always achieve Nash equilibrium and convergence by exploiting the finite improvement property. We then propose a task migration (TM) algorithm that includes three task-processing methods and two task-migration methods. Based on the TM algorithm, computation overhead minimization offloading (COMO) algorithm is presented. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed TM and COMO algorithms reduce the computation overhead and increase the success rate of task processing.","Fri, 13 May 2022 13:28:52 UTC (11,742 KB)"
"141","Competition and Cooperation of Autonomous Ridepooling Services: Game-Based Simulation of a Broker Concept","Roman Engelhardt, Patrick Malcolm, Florian Dandl, Klaus Bogenberger","Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)","Autonomous mobility on demand services have the potential to disrupt the future mobility system landscape. Ridepooling services in particular can decrease land consumption and increase transportation efficiency by increasing the average vehicle occupancy. Nevertheless, because ridepooling services require a sufficient user base for pooling to take effect, their performance can suffer if multiple operators offer such a service and must split the demand. This study presents a simulation framework for evaluating the impact of competition and cooperation among multiple ridepooling providers. Two different kinds of interaction via a broker platform are compared with the base cases of a single monopolistic operator and two independent operators with divided demand. In the first, the broker presents trip offers from all operators to customers (similar to a mobility-as-a-service platform), who can then freely choose an operator. In the second, a regulated broker platform can manipulate operator offers with the goal of shifting the customer-operator assignment from a user equilibrium towards a system optimum. To model adoptions of the service design depending on the different interaction scenario, a game setting is introduced. Within alternating turns between operators, operators can adapt parameters of their service (fleet size and objective function) to maximize profit. Results for a case study based on Manhattan taxi data, show that operators generate the highest profit in the broker setting while operating the largest fleet. Additionally, pooling efficiency can nearly be maintained compared to a single operator. With the resulting increased service rate, the regulated competition benefits not only operators (profit) and cities (increased pooling efficiency), but also customers. Contrarily, when users can decide freely, the lowest pooling efficiency and operator profit is observed.","Mon, 9 May 2022 14:22:15 UTC (7,957 KB)"

Silva, Frederico Aleixo, Albert van der Linde, João Leitão, Nuno Preguiça","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)","An increasing number of mobile applications share location-dependent information, from collaborative applications and social networks to location-based games. For such applications, peer-to-peer architectures where mobile devices share information directly may grant lower latency and reduce server load. In this work, we propose a framework to support these applications, providing location-dependent replication. Data has an associated location and is replicated in the mobile devices that show interest and are close to that location. Our proposal combines peer-to-peer synchronisation among mobile devices and replication at edge servers. Our preliminary results are promising.","Mon, 2 May 2022 17:29:33 UTC (139 KB)[v2] Tue, 3 May 2022 10:28:40 UTC (139 KB)"

Batista","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","We investigate a tritrophic system whose cyclic dominance is modelled by the rock-paper-scissors game. We consider that organisms of one or two species are affected by movement limitations, which unbalances the cyclic spatial game. Performing stochastic simulations, we show that mobility unevenness controls the population dynamics. In the case of one slow species, the predominant species depends on the level of mobility restriction, with the slow species being preponderant if the mobility limitations are substantial. If two species face mobility limitations, our outcomes show that being higher dispersive does not constitute an advantage in terms of population growth. On the contrary, if organisms move with higher mobility, they expose themselves to enemies more frequently, being more vulnerable to being eliminated. Finally, our findings show that biodiversity benefits in regions where species are slowed. Biodiversity loss for high mobility organisms, common to cyclic systems, may be avoided with coexistence probability being higher for robust mobility limitations. Our results may help biologists understand the dynamics of unbalanced spatial systems where organisms' dispersal is fundamental to biodiversity conservation.","Wed, 20 Apr 2022 21:59:01 UTC (923 KB)"

Basically, we built two types of vision systems for thrower and skip robots, respectively. First, the thrower robot drives towards a given point of curling sheet to release a stone. Our vision system in the thrower robot initialize 3DoF pose on two dimensional curling sheet and updates the pose to decide for the decision of stone release. Second, the skip robot stands at the opposite side of the thrower robot and monitors the state of the game to make a strategic decision. Our vision system in the skip robot recognize every stones on the curling sheet precisely. Since the viewpoint is quite perspective, many stones are occluded by each others so it is challenging to estimate the accurate position of stone. Thus, we recognize the ellipses of stone handles outline to find the exact midpoint of the stones using perspective Hough transform. Furthermore, we perform tracking of a thrown stone to produce a trajectory for ice condition analysis. Finally, we implemented our vision systems on two mobile robots and successfully perform a single turn and even careful gameplay. Specifically, our vision system includes three cameras with different viewpoint for their respective purposes.","Wed, 20 Apr 2022 04:46:36 UTC (694 KB)"
"145","Decentralized Control of Distributed Cloud Networks with Generalized Network Flows","Yang Cai, Jaime Llorca, Antonia M. Tulino, Andreas F. Molisch","Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)","Emerging distributed cloud architectures, e.g., fog and mobile edge computing, are playing an increasingly important role in the efficient delivery of real-time stream-processing applications (also referred to as augmented information services), such as industrial automation and metaverse experiences (e.g., extended reality, immersive gaming). While such applications require processed streams to be shared and simultaneously consumed by multiple users/devices, existing technologies lack efficient mechanisms to deal with their inherent multicast nature, leading to unnecessary traffic redundancy and network congestion. In this paper, we establish a unified framework for distributed cloud network control with generalized (mixed-cast) traffic flows that allows optimizing the distributed execution of the required packet processing, forwarding, and replication operations. We first characterize the enlarged multicast network stability region under the new control framework (with respect to its unicast counterpart). We then design a novel queuing system that allows scheduling data packets according to their current destination sets, and leverage Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty control theory to develop the first fully decentralized, throughput- and cost-optimal algorithm for multicast flow control. Numerical experiments validate analytical results and demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed design over existing network control policies.","Tue, 19 Apr 2022 17:44:11 UTC (605 KB)[v2] Fri, 30 Sep 2022 03:59:40 UTC (552 KB)"
"146","Personalized incentives as feedback design in generalized Nash equilibrium problems","Filippo Fabiani, Andrea Simonetto, Paul J. Goulart","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","We investigate both stationary and time-varying, nonmonotone generalized Nash equilibrium problems that exhibit symmetric interactions among the agents, which are known to be potential. As may happen in practical cases, however, we envision a scenario in which the formal expression of the underlying potential function is not available, and we design a semi-decentralized Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm. In the proposed two-layer scheme, a coordinator iteratively integrates the (possibly noisy and sporadic) agents' feedback to learn the pseudo-gradients of the agents, and then design personalized incentives for them. On their side, the agents receive those personalized incentives, compute a solution to an extended game, and then return feedback measurements to the coordinator. In the stationary setting, our algorithm returns a Nash equilibrium in case the coordinator is endowed with standard learning policies, while it returns a Nash equilibrium up to a constant, yet adjustable, error in the time-varying case. As a motivating application, we consider the ridehailing service provided by several companies with mobility as a service orchestration, necessary to both handle competition among firms and avoid traffic congestion, which is also adopted to run numerical experiments verifying our results.","Thu, 24 Mar 2022 09:24:29 UTC (2,098 KB)[v2] Wed, 26 Oct 2022 08:53:11 UTC (1,145 KB)[v3] Mon, 22 May 2023 07:34:01 UTC (2,136 KB)"
"147","Adaptive movement strategy may promote biodiversity in the rock-paper-scissors model","J. Menezes, M. Tenorio, E. Rangel","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","We study the role of the adaptive movement strategy in promoting biodiversity in cyclic models described by the rock-paper-scissors game rules. We assume that individuals of one out of the species may adjust their movement to escape hostile regions and stay longer in their comfort zones. Running a series of stochastic simulations, we calculate the alterations in the spatial patterns and population densities in scenarios where not all organisms are physically or cognitively conditioned to perform the behavioural strategy. Although the adaptive movement strategy is not profitable in terms of territorial dominance for the species, it may promote biodiversity. Our findings show that if all individuals are apt to move adaptively, coexistence probability increases for intermediary mobility. The outcomes also show that even if not all individuals can react to the signals received from the neighbourhood, biodiversity is still benefited, but for a shorter mobility range. We find that the improvement in the coexistence conditions is more accentuated if organisms adjust their movement intensely and can receive sensory information from longer distances. We also discover that biodiversity is slightly promoted for high mobility if the proportion of individuals participating in the strategy is low. Our results may be helpful for biologists and data scientists to understand adaptive process learning in system biology.","Tue, 22 Mar 2022 23:50:55 UTC (1,734 KB)[v2] Fri, 23 Dec 2022 19:31:20 UTC (1,722 KB)"
"148","Mobility Equity and Economic Sustainability Using Game Theory","Ioannis Vasileios Chremos, Andreas Malikopoulos","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","In this paper, we consider a multi-modal mobility system of travelers each with an individual travel budget, and propose a game-theoretic framework to assign each traveler to a ``mobility service"" (each one representing a different mode of transportation). We are interested in equity and sustainability, thus we maximize the worst-case revenue of the mobility system while ensuring ``mobility equity,"" which we define it in terms of accessibility. In the proposed framework, we ensure that all travelers are truthful and voluntarily participate under informational asymmetry, and the solution respects the individual budget of each traveler. Each traveler may seek to travel using multiple services (e.g., car, bus, train, bike). The services are capacitated and can serve up to a fixed number of travelers at any instant of time. Thus, our problem falls under the category of many-to-one assignment problems, where the goal is to find the conditions that guarantee the stability of assignments. We formulate a linear program of maximizing worst-case revenue under the constraints of mobility equity, and we fully characterize the optimal solution.","Tue, 22 Mar 2022 02:27:51 UTC (348 KB)[v2] Thu, 29 Sep 2022 21:35:14 UTC (479 KB)[v3] Sun, 26 Feb 2023 05:49:51 UTC (79 KB)"
"149","Adaptive movement strategy in rock-paper-scissors models","M. Tenorio, E. Rangel, J. Menezes","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","Organisms may respond to local stimuli that benefit or threaten their fitness. The adaptive movement behaviour may allow individuals to adjust their speed to maximise the chances of being in comfort zones, where death risk is minimal. We investigate spatial cyclic models where the rock-paper-scissors game rules describe the nonhierarchical dominance. We assume that organisms of one out of the species can control the mobility rate in response to the information obtained from scanning the environment. Running a series of stochastic simulations, we quantify the effects of the movement strategy on the spatial patterns and population dynamics. Our findings show that the ability to change mobility to adapt to environmental clues is not reflected in an advantage in cyclic spatial games. The adaptive movement provokes a delay in the spatial domains occupied by the species in the spiral waves, making the group more vulnerable to the advance of the dominant species and less efficient in taking territory from the dominated species. Our outcomes also show that the effects of adaptive movement behaviour accentuate whether most individuals have a long-range neighbourhood perception. Our results may be helpful for biologists and data scientists to comprehend the dynamics of ecosystems where adaptive processes are fundamental.","Sat, 12 Mar 2022 23:11:07 UTC (772 KB)[v2] Fri, 23 Dec 2022 19:19:52 UTC (816 KB)"

The protocol must ensure a high level of client perceived end-to-end quality of service (QoS) under heavy work load conditions. Each remote display protocol works differently depending on the network and which applications are being delivered. In healthcare applications, doctors and nurses can use mobile devices directly to monitor patients. Moreover, the ability to implement tasks requiring high consumption of CPU and other resources is applicable to a variety of applications including research and cloud gaming. Such computer games and complex processes will run on powerful cloud servers and the screen contents will be transmitted to the client. TO enable such applications, remote display technology requires further enhancements to meet more stringent requirements on bandwidth and QoS, an to allow realtime operation. In this paper, we present an architecture including flexible QoS control to improve the user quality of experience (QoE). The QoS control is developed based on linear regression modeling using historical network data. Additionally, the architecture includes a novel compression algorithm of 2D images, designed to guarantee the best image quality and to reduce video delay; this algorithm is based on k-means clustering and can satisfy the requirements of realtime onboard processing. Through simulations with a real work dataset collected by the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Lab, we present experimental as well as explain the performance of the QoS system.","Fri, 11 Mar 2022 03:22:11 UTC (16,428 KB)"
