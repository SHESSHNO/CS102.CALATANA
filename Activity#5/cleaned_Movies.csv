"The Pope's Exorcist","tresm87","9 April 2023","Like clockwork we have at least 2 possession films each year around the same time. Easter and Halloween it seems. They're usually hit or miss with the same cliches strewn about with maybe some attempts at being slightly innovative. While this doesn't break away too much from the plot formula, Crowe's powerhouse performance does and amplifies the overall film to enticing levels. He has clearly found his late career niche with thrillers/horrors of late and it works extremely well. The scares are serviceable and the story is as well. Visually it's one of the best possession films I've seen in quite sometime with fantastic settings and terrific practical and cgi features. This doesn't mean the cliches don't hinder it at times but overall a very welcome film for the genre.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Sleepin_Dragon","25 April 2023","Father Gabriele Amorth is dispatched by The Vatican to assist a family, who's youngest member has become possessed by a powerful Demon, Amorth unearths all manner of secrets, some of which The Vatican would prefer stayed secret.I'll be honest, I had low expectations for this film, let's be honest, how many possession films have been released in recent years, some low budget some high, one or two pretty good, the majority not white. The Pope's Exorcist actually rates quite highly.There are the moments and sequences that you'd expect, the jump scares, the dialogues, the explosions, they're all there, but there is so much more, the characters are all well developed and have more depth than you'd expect, it delivers scares and emotional kicks in equal measure.Father Amorth is the coolest Priest I've seen on the big screen, Russell Crowe was brilliant, he was tough, he was funny, he drove a Vespa, on my book, be rocked.This film gave me back some faith in a genre that I thought had long since run its course.8/10.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","LovesCinematography","20 August 2023","It's a double edged sword when an actor becomes super famous. On one side, they are extremely marketable and gain great roles. However, on the other side, we tend to see the actor in the movie and not the character which distracts from the experience of the story.This was not the case with this film. I'm not an accent specialist nor a native Italian speaker, but Russell's portrayable had me convinced.The story itself was exciting and intriguing. There were some nonsensical aspects of course. Its a very fictional film with its own share of contradictions that are noticeable. The authenticity of the Vatican traditions and language barriers might have been compromised, but as a normal viewer, none of it was recognizable thus not bothered.Overall I give this a 7. It's not going to leave a lasting impression on me, but It was a good to watch.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","hillman_mcfc","8 April 2023","I honestly went in their with really low expectations. I walked out of The Devil in Me as we've seen it all before it's the same formula and nothing ever will live up to the original Exorcist. I think I can name 3 good exorcism movies. The Exorcist, Exorcist 3 and the Exorcism of Emily Rose. The plot really gets moving fast! There's no real character building but what I will say is Russell Crowe really does play the part well. It's a mixture of a great performance and a parody..whatever it is it works! It doesn't really do anything new, we've seen it all before but for some reason or another this was better than expected. Give it a watch.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","skyhawk747","9 April 2023","Having not seen a decent horror surface for a long time, I was quite excited to go along and see Crowe's first horror flick.It says ""inspired by Vatican files"" so I'm not quite sure how much of this film is factual but It's your typical possession story. However, Russell Crowe plays a solid and strong performance which makes his character very likeable and most importantly believable. I also liked his characters sense of humour which Crowe played very well..Lot's of cliches, although it was a good watch but not very scary. The special effects and CGI for the most of the movie were very good but it did struggle during certain moments. The depth to the plot was good but I feel the other characters could have been stronger.Overall, this is a good movie and Crowe carried it very well. I'd recommend that you go if you like this genre.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","nathangoffnett","16 May 2023","I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed The Pope's Exorcist. After initially seeing the trailers, I wrote this movie off as a standard possession film that I have seen time and time again, and while most of that is still true, there is something about this film that made it a joy to watch.The film does not attempt to do anything particularly new or groundbreaking in the genre, but everything it has is handled with care and precision. The direction is fantastic, with a very quick pace that makes each scene have a sense of urgency as our characters attempt to perform the exorcism. There is particularly deep lore that is established within the church structure, with different factions and politics at play that add a slightly different dimension rather than just your run-of-the-mill ""insert random priest here.""My favorite aspect of the film is the acting. I think all of the adult characters do a tremendous job here. Russell Crowe kills it in every scene he is in and definitely gives an entirely different take on the exorcist character. Where most are intensely serious and melodramatic, Crowe adds a bit of whimsicalness and youth to the character that creates a calming presence to every intense scene. His rapport with Daniel Zovatto is excellent. The two really play off each other well and carried the film in many ways. Alex Essoe was great, although underutilized. The two children were okay. The boy gave a very stereotypical portrayal of a possessed child, and the daughter was flat in many ways.My only complaint about the entire film is its lack of originality and the story. Every single beat is something that we have seen before; there were no new or fresh ideas that were interjected into the story. The tension was fine, but nothing was particularly scary. Overall, if not for the film's fantastic director and cast, it would have been a bomb.Score: 63% üëç
Verdict: Decent.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Eric266","21 August 2023","Russell Crowe plays the real life Pope's exorcist, Gabriele Amorth. Father Amorth passed away in 2006 and its probably a good thing. While this movie is spooky and entertaining, its a big, exaggerated, and I assume highly fictionalized, version of a time in Father Amorth's life.The Pope (Franco Nero) assigns Father Amorth to look into a potential demonic possession of a young boy in Spain. The boy, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney), his mother Julia (Alex Essoe) and his sister Amy (Laurel Marsden) are Americans who move to Spain after the death of Henry's father in a car accident. They are living in an old Spanish abbey that is the only think Julia's husband left them when he died in a car accident the year before. A local priest, Father Esquible (Daniel Zovatto) is out of his element, but is enlisted by Amorth to assist in the exorcism.The possession tropes are all here. Contortions, scary voices, lights going on and off, crosses turning upside down, people getting thrown around, possessed people spewing fluids and cursing, climbing walls and crawling around like spiders. There is a mystery about the origin of the abbey dealing with the church's role in the Inquisition.There is some gratuitous nudity that just felt out of place in this movie. I mean, I like naked breasts as much as the next guy, but it just felt a bit uneccessary.Crowe does a really good job as Father Amorth. He has the right balance of faith, weariness and conviction for someone who faces evil of all kinds. Zovatto's performance as Father Esquibel, to me, was the highlight of the film. He keeps everything grounded, despite the bizarre happenings. All three of the actors playing the family members are cookie-cutter performances and don't really add or subtract from the proceedings. There are some genuine chills in this move and a few scary moments. I enjoyed it and its crisp runtime kept it from getting boring. Still, I was hoping for a bit more story and less stunt work. I mean how many times do we need to see someone get thrown across a room into a mirrored wall and get right back up? One character, while wrestling with a possessed child, gets their head smashed through a ceramic sink with no effect. I might have tapped out and sought some aspirin.Enjoy it for what it is. Then go watch the Exorcist again.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","honeybloggs-69648","21 May 2023","Critics said that Russell Crowe's performance as an Italian was dismal . I strongly disagree . He captured the essence of an Italian man . His accent was excellent
I liked the way he delivered his lines and the way he showed his sense of humour . He was fantastic !The other actors were great too ! . The Set was brilliantThis film could have been spectacular .However it was marred by the boy. The little boy over acted his role . It looked ridiculous and laughable . It is not the child's fault . It was the casting director's fault and the film directors fault . The little boy had the 'stage school presence' about him . These kids who go to stage schools over emphasise everything as they are taught to . They are trained for roles in the Theatre where everything is over dramatised . So when these kids appear in films , it doesn't work . UNLESS the film director can obliterate that stage school training and give these kids a fresh approach and train them in a totally different way so they can act well in films .Also the voice the boy had as a demon was not synched properly ! It looked pathetic! . He looked like he was playing a joke on the Priests and would burst into a fit of giggles at any time . How could anyone involved in the film think that sounded scary and authentic! It made the film into a comedy horror ! I was laughing .If the Casting Director had chosen the right boy to play the part the film would have been fantastic . It is still a good movie and worth watching
The twist at the End is great and unexpected . Loved that! .Some people in this review section said it's been done before . Well it's very hard to get new concept in horror films. I don't care if it was done before as long as it's done well !","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","RachelMary2","14 April 2023","Oh dear. I'm not sure if the makers of this movie were going for comedy horror or something else but it didn't really work. It was basically a film of silly voices. There wasn't enough tension to hold my engagement or enough story to keep me interested.Some of the effects were good but nothing I haven't seen before. Russell Crowe was enjoyable to watch but it was difficult to take his character seriously and I'm not sure as a viewer I was supposed to. It was all just a bit too silly for my taste. I didn't believe the setting, it was too fantastical and the family characters were more like caricatures. It sort of hinted at a story for them but that didn't really go anywhere. So, superfluous and silly but not awful.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","jp_91","6 April 2023","After seeing the trailer for ""The Pope's Exorcist"", I thought it would be another one of those lousy exorcism movies that have been released in recent years, but to my surprise I found a good, entertaining movie that enjoys some clich√©s of the exorcism movie theme. The performances are good, Russell Crowe achieves an interesting performance, while Franco Nero offers a successful performance. The script with the already boring legend: ""based on true events"", is entertaining and has innovative moments, other interesting ones and a funny appearance of clich√©s, the dialogues are usually plausible but some jokingly are absurd. The soundtrack has potential and the cinematography triumphs with its chiaroscuro, achieving a good atmosphere together with the filming locations. The downside are the digital special effects that look fake in several scenes, but the gore and some old-school effects are welcome. ""The Pope's Exorcist"" isn't the best exorcism movie ever made, but it manages to stand out from most that have touched on this subject in recent years.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","arungeorge13","6 May 2023","Julius Avery's films Overlord and Samaritan have offered differing outputs and satisfaction levels, but one thing that made them both stand out is their unique visual signature. So, when he ventures into an exorcism film set in Spain with Russell Crowe starrring, there's always a sense of ""oh let's see how that turns out."" That's just natural excitement! But the plot, the house-with-dark-secrets setting, the Vatican connection, the generic exorcism scenes - everything comes with a seen-that-before stamp. There's also some excessive CGI which is off-putting in horror films, further dissolving the overall impact.I'll give credit to Avery for some of the wider, panoramic shots. However, most of the interior scenes not only lack the basic horror ingredient (i.e. The element of surprise) but also the decision to juxtapose humour in critical situations takes the whole damn wind out of the sails. It works only when the humour is situationally dark and organic (like in, say Evil Dead Rise) but here, everyone except for Crowe's character is shown to be pissing their pants. And that includes the Pope himself. Also, the supporting cast is pretty hit-and-miss. Ultimately, this film does nothing for the exorcism sub-genre. It ends up being just another exorcism flick with very little redeemable qualities.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","FeastMode","7 May 2023","From my review for Prey for the Devil (2 stars): ""I also think I might be done with exorcism horror flicks. A couple come out each year and they're usually useless.""Because of this, I originally had no interest in The Pope's Exorcist. But I saw some good buzz around it and gave in. I thought it might be different. Why would I think that?How many times can we see a cross turn upside down? How many times can we see a body contortionist? How many times can we see a priest yelling at the possessed? How many times can we see someone thrown against a wall?It's all the same, and I don't know how people continue to be scared or entertained by it. This movie could not get me even 1% invested, intrigued or scared. I didn't care about anything except maybe how often the lead actress makes the same facial expression. (1 viewing, 5/6/2023)","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","eoinpgeary","11 April 2023","Finally, I am sick to death of horror movies that solely rely on jump scares to call it a horror, this story had a bit of weight to it and I was happy overall.So it's your average story, the chief exorcist is sent to do an exorcism, what changes this movie is that it has a nice to to the Vatican and the church dating way back and many hidden secrets.Russel Crowe was fantastic, having an actor that can bring a certain charm to a role like this is definitely drawing.The ""scenes"" were all good and it took a route I wasn't expecting. The CG was good along worth an effective score and good prosthetics. The supporting cast were good and i especially enjoyed father Thomas.There were some times that felt a little unnecessary BUT the good outweighs the bad in this one and I can honestly see a sequel if it does well. I'd recommend going out to see it in cinema !","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Jester222","5 May 2023","SPOILERS.Predictable and cheesey ""You're all going to die"" (delivered with zero menace by a child actor, they should have looked harder because he's unconvincing or maybe its the direction) and some scenes are unintentionally hilarious. ""Wrong Priest"" üòÅ and the ""Panty Sniffer "" priest who is totally useless and his acting b movie level. Is it meant to be a dark comedy? Also would you seriously leave a young boy alone with a Catholic priest!?.The films desperation to add shocking dialogue from a child fails and it all still pales in comparison to The Exorcist even now after all these years. Some very poor cgi throughout.The Demon sounds like one of the Orcs from Lord of the Rings. Like a London Taxi Driver with a sore throat. Ha ha.Its cliche after cliche. Crowes accent isn't as annoying as I thought from Trailer and his acting is strong considering the turd he is in.Who the hell directed this? Is it their first Horror film? It fails to have any genuine
The location is magnificent though love that place. üòç and some impressive sets. But its full fat cheese.The fact they try to pass off all the child sex abuse of the Catholic Church because of Satan is insulting to all those who were abused.Despite all these negatives. I am still kinda enjoyed parts of it as a comedy. Things try best pick up once they enter the Catacomb but its a mess at the end of the day.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","SnoopyStyle","14 May 2023","It's 1987. Father Gabriel Amorth (Russell Crowe) is the Chief Exorcist appointed by the Pope (Franco Nero). He faces skeptism from some in the church. He refers 98% of his cases to the medical professionals. He is called to Spain for a dangerous case. Widower Julia (Alex Essoe) and her two kids, Henry and Amy, moved into an old Abbey inherited from her late husband. Henry becomes possessed. Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto) is the local priest.This suffers from the standard horror problem. The family would never stay in the house especially after the gas problem. Sure, the fireballs are fun, but no reasonable family would stay in a place that could blow up at any time. Amorth gives the mom a reason to stay, but the hot teen has to stay for completely different non-story reasons. Aside from that, this is a fine possession horror. It's not great. Russell Crowe gives this movie some heft. I would definitely play up the 'based on real story' aspect even if it's not true. The movie seems to end with sequels in mind. I don't see any of that coming.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ajikude","6 May 2023","I didn't have high expectations but it was more boring than I thought. Russell does his part acting but the script is simple, sophomoreish and the dialogue is predictable and simple The costume is not realistic, too new, the acting of the kids are too woody. The special effects are laughable. The most scary scenes I found myself laughing out loud...The scare scenes are too predictable and not scary...the cinemato6is sometimes good and sometimes very bad, the music is over dramatic, they rely too much on using the music to make it dramatic...I would not recommend watching this unless you were stoned at home or if there was nothing else on TV. I certainly would not pay to watch it.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Hussain-AL-Naseer","29 April 2023","The Pope's Exorcist is another cliched horror movie that fails to offer anything new or innovative to the genre. The story revolves around the same old tired tropes of a haunted mansion, a family moving in, and a malevolent ghost targeting a child. The film lacks any jump scares or truly scary moments, relying instead on tired and predictable horror clich√©s.Even the presence of Russell Crowe fails to elevate the film, as he is given a limited scope of work and ultimately cannot save the movie from its own mediocrity. The Pope's Exorcist is a disappointing addition to the horror genre and fails to bring anything new or worthwhile to the table.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","xxmisssvxx","20 April 2023","As someone that loves movies in general and often reviews films as they are, I saw this film last week and it was surprisingly better than expected. Is it golden globe worthy? Not at all but it is worthy enough to deliver what it was supposed to do? Yes. I love exorcism based films for the stories they tell and the types of demons we learn about through the stories. Exorcism films generally focus more on a storyline rather than the adrenaline of scare that differs (and separates) from the elements of creepiness. The Pope's Exorcist does just that - focuses on the story without much of the scare factor, which is exactly what this film should be, and is. That's what I wanted and got - a story. The only creepy elements are the castle, the grounds of the home itself. That's it. The cinematography was beautiful and the demon/possessions revealed in this film was solid; the aggressiveness of the demon. Russell Crowe delivers a strong performance with a pinch of sarcasm that compliments his character..
.The only element I didn't care for was the family, specifically the actors that were cast for their characters didn't fit the film in my opinion. Especially the actor cast as the daughter-who looked and felt disconnected. She was not the best choice for this role in my opinion; she just didn't fit in. This film is worth seeing but it won't be your first choice..

"The Pope's Exorcist","Howling_at_the_Moon_Reviews","23 August 2023","So I will say that this was better than I expected it to be. While the story wasn't anything crazy original or innovative, it was still thoroughly entertaining with solid and engaging pacing and decent acting across the board.Despite some wavering with the accent, and some cliche humor, I thought Crowe did a good job and I enjoyed his character. The mother also did a solid job, I am a fan of Alex Essoe. The only acting that stuck out negatively to me was that of Cardinal Sullivan.While I think this story would have been a bit more successful with something different than every other exorcism tale... it was very atmospheric, awesome locations and some really cool CGI/special effects. I don't think this will blow you away by any means but it is most certainly an entertaining, spooky experience.Despite its biggest downfall being lack of originality and recycling of clich√©s and tropes, I think a lot of other positives took up for that. 6.5 rounding to a 7, would recommend.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","vengeance20","7 April 2023","Saw a few previews for this prior to watching & to be fair, wasn't expecting much, the previews didn't exactly show much or sell the film to me as such. But, being a horror fan I went into see this anyway.Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth, Chief Exorcist of the Vatican. The film follows Amorth in the summer of 1987 as he investigates a young boy's terrifying possession & ends up uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden.I found the film to be surprisingly good! At first, it seemed to be pretty sub standard stuff for a supernatural flick, though not bad. But, when it got to the middle & really broke in, it started to really show some good stuff going on & by the third act & the end, it was ace!The films runtime isn't bad at 97 minutes (1 hour & 37 minute), along with it's pacing which is a little slow in areas, but not bad. The characters of the family could've been better developed more I think, but the story is good & the visuals are pretty ace too along with a great triumph of an ending!Overall, it's a great film supernatural horror film! It isn't groundbreaking stuff, but what does it matter? It's got a good (true) story, has some great & scary visuals & a triumph of an ending you'll love! Russell Crowe is good in this & with a great runtime, & not bad pacing, this is one supernatural flick you won't want to miss!9/10.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","scootm16","14 April 2023","Wow what a boring, bland piece of demonic trash! Almost nothing happens this entire movie that takes place in basically one setting. Every trope ever conceived in an exorcism movie is on full display, but in the most bland way possible. It's as if the director doesn't know how to orchestrate tension because there was ZERO.The demon was an absolute joke with little to no power. All the demon would do was stay tied to the bed and yell terribly wirtten expletives that you would hear a 9 year-old yell in an Xbox Live lobby.The only somewhat redeeming/entertaining factor of this movie was Russell Crowe in an extremely random role. Still, they didn't let Crowe chew the scenery enough because the director probably wanted to keep the vibe of the movie ""dark and horrifying"", though it was most definitely neither.There was also a terrible part during the finale where Crowe and his sidekick pull out their crosses for one last chance at beating the demon. I kid you not, when they pulled out the crosses, they made a high-pitched ""power-up"" noise, as if the crosses were charging up a power attack. What an absolute joke!I can't believe all the people giving this dumpster fire a 9 or 10. Thats just complete disrespect to cinema and you should be thrown to the depths of Hell for such blasphemy.3.5/10.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Lomax343","1 May 2023","Fifty years ago, The Exorcist was a groundbreaking piece of cinema. This tired and tiring rip-off, is a disgrace.Here are the differences between the two: The sick child is a boy, the projectile vomit is red, and the spider-crawl wasn't left on the cutting-room floor.Here are the similarities: Everything else. People in the cinema were laughing as they audibly ticked off a check-list.To be fair to Russell Crowe, the only thing he really did wrong was to agree to appear in the first place. To be fair to the rest of the cast, some of them were too young to realise what a travesty they'd got themselves into.To be fair to the writer, the director and the producer(s) you would need a pointed stick.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","iboso64","20 April 2023","SPOILER Russel Crowe is fun, and the movie moves along quite nicely. There's a mystery that must be solved, too. Wonderful special effects, and a game cast round out what should have been a fun, occasionally scary (whatever that means) movie. Unfortunately...In two different scenes, Father Exorcist discovers ""truths"" about the past of the Catholic Church, regarding their most infamous, uh, transgressions; The Spanish Inquisition and the more recent, decades-long sexual abuse scandal. And what is the film's conclusion, you ask? That the Devil did it all. Not humans. The Devil. This film literally vomited all over everyone who ever suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church.Good going.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","classicsoncall","18 July 2023","I haven't seen a lot of other movies of this type since 1973's ""The Exorcist"", so I can't relate to other reviewers remarking how this one resembles 'hundreds' of other films about exorcism. If there were hundreds of other exorcist movies, I think I'd at least be aware of them. For what this was, I thought it was pretty good. Russell Crowe portrays a dedicated but sometimes ribald servant of God, placed in the unenviable position of being a handpicked exorcist for the Pope. The Pope is never mentioned by name, but the years 1986 through 2016 coincide with the papacies of John Paul II, Benedict XVI and current Pope Francis. The one in the story, portrayed by Franco Nero, most closely resembles John Paul II, who reigned from 1978 till 2005.Though the movie follows a fairly traditional formula (like those hundreds of others), I thought it was well done. The opening scene prepares the viewer for the idea that most cases of presumed demonic possession are really something else requiring a doctor or psychiatrist to sort out. I wouldn't have expected the ratio to be 98:2, but on reflection, that seems to make sense. So, when Father Gabriel Amorth (Crowe) is dispatched to Spain to investigate the case of a young boy named Henry (Peter de Souza-Feighoney), he's immediately confronted by a demon that even he realizes will require immense effort to free the youth. Assisting Amorth is the local priest, Father Tomas Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto), who harbors a few secrets of his own that he must confess before the sacred rituals begin.A subtext of the picture involves the origins of the Spanish Inquisition and its origins, a topic I'm not familiar enough with to comment on, but something I'll want to investigate further. I'll also want to investigate the story of the real Father Gabriel Amorth, beginning with the William Friedkin directed documentary, ""The Devil and Father Amorth"", and maybe even pick up one of the books by the good Father. By all accounts, including the movie, they're supposed to be real good.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","fairlesssam","5 May 2023","This movie is nothing new, the same has been done so many times before and much better than this. The plot is slow and boring, nothing is unexpected or exciting. The cast don't give any kind of charisma or gel well. The use of Ralph Ineson's voice for the demon was very distracting and, because its so recognisable, had a negative effect on the believability while watching. The lack of originality was frustrating and I found it very difficult to engage in what was happening or even care.On the positive side, Peter DeSouza-Feighoney is quite an incredible actor. He stole the show and, for me, was the only good thing to come out of it.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","flicklover","20 April 2023","When u saw the trailer for this film I was like here we go again. Another demon possession film that will use the tropes that every film of this kind have used since The Exorcist. I understand that they are tropes that are necessary fur this type of film. There have been some, very few films about demonic possession that have been good. It is a tired sub genre that is just run out of good ideas.The Pope's Exorcist supposedly has two things going for it. It has Russell Crowe as Father Gabriele Amorth. This priest was a real exorcist at The Vatican so the trailer says the film is based on a true story. I had heard of Father Amourth and it would have been interesting to see a film that was about this man's pretty unique life. What we get is a very hammy performance by Crowe. But a bad performance but he seemed to be playing this with a wink. The story is about a widowed mother and her two kids that move into an abbey in Spain that was left to them by her husband. The son gets possessed by a demon so the Pope asks Father Amourth to go and investigate and perform an exorcism if needed. No more plot explanation needed. The family is just there to be victimized by the demon. We do not really get any time to care about this family so what happens to the boy is just plays as a checklist of every visual trope that has ever been put in one these films. There is no atmosphere, no tension, no sense of dread. Just a been there done that series of scenes that we've seen hundreds of times. Another arrives and of course starts the exorcism and we get a CGI filled, uninspired mid budget special effects battle. The film is not bad as much as it is lazy. Russel Crowe does his best to bring some value to the film but he can't save it.An uninspired, lazy, completely forgettable film.Grade: D.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","JPEI64","17 April 2023","A load of tripe disguised as a 'horror' movie, by using the Catholic Church (a favourite punching bag), the Pope and the Catholic faith as a crutch. It is to the Vatican's credit that no one objected to this drivel.Dreadful storyline, acting, script and dialogues. The kid looks anything but evil. Everything is hyper bloated to include explosions, bloody mouths spewing obscenities, twisting bodies and ear shattering screams - none of which are horrifying, - rather tiresome.So it's a been there done that movie that drains you halfway and just when you thought everyone's done, the voice says 'We' re not done yet!'. Aaaagh! The horrors!!Watch it if your cinemas has great popcorn and snacks. Otherwise, strictly avoid and offer a prayer for everyone connected with this nonsense.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","chris_rowe-881-168820","12 April 2023","I watch a lot of movies and horrors are a particular favourite of mine but with actors/budget this one has I expected it to be atleast decent but I'd put it down as one of the worst films I've ever seen, I nearly walked out at multiple points as it just got dumber and dumber and was trying to act like it was a credit for or serious film, even potentially teasing more, but I hope that was just explaining their future as this is s world that never needs revisiting.Why on earth did they cast him as the lead? I mean his name value isn't as big as it was but he was awful, his accent, delivery and well just about everything was bad here, I'd have been so embarrassed. Surely their are Italian actors or ones who could've leant credibility to the role?The effects were tragic, the stuff with the women was hilarious but again looked ridiculous and the family weren't remotely interesting or likeable and some of the stuff the little boy said will no doubt be used as a joke for years to come.It was all so corny and ridiculous, there was nothing remotely scary, the story was rotten and the acting was even worse. Don't waste your money, I've seen plenty of exorcist movies from big obvious ones to budget dvd ones and this isn't even good enough to be a cheap dvd, avoid!","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ryandannar","9 September 2023","I don't think I'm going to leave a proper review of this movie, because it doesn't really deserve it. But you, dear reader, do deserve to know that this is probably the funniest exorcism movie I have ever seen.Was it supposed to be funny? I am not sure. It does seem like Russell Crowe is having a grand time playing the titular character. His role calls for broad gravitas delivered with a knowing wink, and Crowe handles the demands of the part like it's a piece a'cake, and looks like he's having a lot of fun doing it.But if the movie was intended to be camp, Russell Crowe seems to have been the only actor who got the memo. Everything about this movie is so overstated and ridiculous that it's impossible for it to be anything but funny.And yet, there is definitely something enjoyable about watching a bad horror film that makes you laugh at its awfulness. Despite blood, and bodily contortions, and blasphemous curses, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" never succeeds at being even a little bit scary. Nor does it succeed in having anything interesting to say, theologically, other than the notion that church atrocities may have been ""the work of the devil!""(I mean, come on, what isn't ""the work of the devil?"" I live in the overwhelmingly Christian state of Oklahoma, and I can assure you that if anyone ever did anything bad - or ever took pleasure in anything that made someone else feel icky - it was ""the work of the devil."" To me, calling something ""the work of the devil"" is akin to letting someone off the hook for their actions, disavowing personal responsibility, and/or shaming those who are different than you.)I digress. Anyway, the best exorcism films out there are still the original ""The Exorcist,"" and perhaps ""The Exorcist III."" Those films are scary not only because of horrific imagery, but also because they have a genuine interest in honest theological questions.In comparison, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" is about as scary as an episode of ""Scooby Doo."" But I did laugh almost continuously during this movie because it was so hilariously bad. And that's not worth nothing. Hence, four stars out of 10.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","CinemaSerf","13 April 2023","Based on a real character from the murkier side of quite recent Vatican operations, Russell Crowe dons his cassock and travels to a remote abbey in Spain where his meets with ""Fr. Esquibel"" (Daniel Zovatto). Why? Well it seems that a young boy is being possessed by a singularly nasty demon. Now Fr. Amorth is not unused to these scenarios and is also aware that the vast majority of these situations have nothing to do with satanic practices and more to do with mental health issues. Quickly, though, he realises that this is a serious and potentially deadly demonisation and both he and his colleague must discover what went on at this place and just who their violent foe is, before they can have any hope of casting it back into the shadows. That's the plot, and to be fair Crowe actually plays his character with a bit of charisma, but the rest of this is the same old loudly scored, visual effects feast with plenty of routine dramatic scenes: screaming, eye-popping, ceiling climbing, bodies and holy water thrown about the place and this one even has a bit of the Spanish Inquisition thrown in for added authenticity. It's not that is terrible - it isn't; it is just all so very derivative. Just because the exorcist was real doesn't actually make this film any different from an whole spate of other similar films that have the same beginning, middle, and end... It will do fine on the television around Halloween, but the cinema adds little to the presentation. It's nice to see that Franco Nero is still making films, but otherwise this is adequate, but nothing more.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","kosmasp","18 April 2023","No pun intended - actually puns, considering the layers I used with my summary line there. Probably more than I thought of at first. And the movie also way more entertaining and fun (in more than one way), than I expected. I have to admit, I actually thought this movie would not be any good ... maybe decent at best. So maybe I am going over the top a bit with the rating - or I am just right about that (only slightly kidding with that).Russell Crowe really seems to have fun with the character. Well it is based on an actual person - and the story is based on something he wrote (which supposedly or allegedly is really good - the end credits remind us of that). While there can only be one Exorcist (no pun intended, as in movie that is), there can be other movies that depict and have nice stories and/or characters.I had to endure some people in the cinema that were not really understanding the concept of cinemas and others not wanting to hear their voices - the woman going ""now now now"" right before a scary scene or jump scare was about to happen - very annoying. But I was able to blend that out, plus the movie was loud enough in the appropriate scenes for that not to matter. So even with having to endure stuff like that, I had a good time.Now the movie is not without flaws - the ... attempt to clear a lot of evil the church has done is quite brazen for example ... but I take it as creative freedom. Also not the worst idea if you want to plead not guilty ... you'll understand once you watch the movie.Good acting, good effects and while not every character may get the depth they deserve the planting/seeding and sowing ... works quite well. Blink and you'll miss some of the good things the cinematography has laid out for you - without the director putting too much emphasis on it. Especially when it is not spoon fed to you. Sometimes you have to let things fly/free ... they will come back to you (and with that pun I bid farewell - may the power of .. whatever you believe help you)","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","allmoviesfan","24 July 2023","Not the best Italian accent from Australia's own Russell Crowe, but an interesting if dark and violent film based on a true story of Father Gabriele Amorth, apparently a somewhat cantankerous Vatican priest, and his attempts to try and free a possessed boy in Spain.What follows is, to be frank, fairly grim (there is not much in the way of sunshine and warm feelings in this one), and tests Amorth's faith. Crowe is pretty good in the role, a hulking sort of man with a weathered face who seems fairly implacable, even in the face of pure evil. The exorcism uncovers some awkward truths for the Catholic church. The finale was very well done, everything building to a crescendo.Not a religious person by any stretch, but I nonetheless found this darkly entertaining. Other than the accent issues, I thought Russell Crowe did a good job.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","teocrito","9 April 2023","The Exorcist changed everything after was released in 1973. It set the framework of every single horror movie about possessions or demons. From the scenery, the way the possessed person acts and the parts of the Bible they quote.There are good examples that comes after it. Some with the same ideas but new story lines and terrifying demons.However, this is not it. This is just another silly copycat of what the Exorcist tryed to achieve. It is the same thing all over again, nothing we haven't seen dozens of times in many other failed productions.It started OK. It had the typical Exorcist vibes. Some funny moments too. But then it is just got everything wrong.First of all, the story is predictable as hell, you know who is going to be possessed, why and how it is going to develop since minute one.Secondly, the localization is a joke. Of course, this is and American movie, so they do not expect, nor care, that someone is going to be able to recognize where is set. Anyone that has been in Segovia can tell there is no way that place is in there. Castille, especially that area is dry and with lots of plains. The place looks like it is in the north or in any other country. The actor that portrays the Spanish priest is from Costa Rica, and doesn't look like someone born and raised in the central meseta. Specially in the eighties, when Spain wasn't as multicultural as it is today. The same thing happens with the workers, they haven't seen a Spanish construction worker in their lives.The plot twist is just nonsense. The idea that the origin of the Spanish inquisition is because some bishop was possessed by a demon is just ridiculous. It is the product of the Spanish black legend. You just have to take a history book to know that there were inquisitions formed all over Europe in medieval times way long before the Spanish one. Of course they were cruel, but it wasn't nothing new at those times, and protestants and every single branch of Christianism did the same when it came to heretics.Just as we saw in the Exorcist, this movie use the same old Bible extracts and in the same way. They don't even care how silly it looks repeating the same formula since 1973. At least in that movie were trying to be realistic and before they could carry the exorcism they needed the authorization of the bishop and there needed to be a doctor present. Here they are just trying to look cool, with some typical head turning 180¬∞, a demon voice shouting blasphemies and lots of guttural noises. That is not an exorcism, that is just repeating what seems to be worked in dozens of movies before... But failed.Anyway, I could carry on with many more inconsistencies but this movie doesn't deserve it.I would skip it and watch The Exorcist instead, when it comes to movies about possessions you don't need any other.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","lucaherion","7 April 2023","I expected the typical horror movie with a lot of jumpscares and loud sounds but actually I got to see a fairly good story with very good actors and nice scenery. So while I was watching the movie I kept forgetting that it belongs to the horror genre. I mean sure, the make up was very creepy and also the voices of the possessed people was brought very well but still I was more focused on the story and it's ending than I usually am.Additionally it's important to point out that the actors were introduced very well and followed a good storytelling.In conclusion, don't watch it as the typical bad horror movie with jumpscares to keep you entertained and rather look at it as a story that's being told.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ndunn-39806","6 April 2023","Is this film perfect, absolutely not. But it is certainly a great watch. I enjoyed Crowe's performance and found the humor he brought to the role spot on. It wasn't over the top, and it felt organic.The special effects and CGI for the most part were very good. With only a few moments the broke the suspension of disbelief.I enjoyed the depth to the plot and how it approached faith in general. Was nice to see some decent attempts at passing past the usual possession schtick.Overall this is a really solid film and I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to any fans of the religious horror/possession genre.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","BA_Harrison","6 April 2023","I'm a bit unsure about whether The Pope's Exorcist is supposed to be a serious film or a parody: the cast play it absolutely straight with little evidence of star Russell Crowe having his tongue in cheek, but the whole thing is so cheesy at times that it's hard to see how it could possibly be taken as anything but a knowingly daft pastiche of the genre. If you decide to go see the film, I suggest you don't take it too seriously...Crowe plays Father Gabriel Amorth, chief exorcist of The Vatican, appointed by the pope to deal with cases of demonic possession. Amorth is sent to Spain to investigate the case of a young boy, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney, doing a hilarious imitation of Linda Blair), who is acting most peculiarly. When the priest arrives, it's time for director Julius Avery to lay on the clich√©s that have been serving horror film-makers (many of them Italian) well for the past fifty years: guttural voices, levitation, rotating heads, vomiting, writing appearing on the body in welts, etcetera, etcetera.The demon causing all the trouble turns out to be none other than Asmodeus, one of the Kings of Hell under Lucifer the emperor. So he's a bit powerful. But Amorth is no slouch when it comes to such matters and, with the help of Spanish priest Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto), he engages the hell spawn in a battle of good versus evil which involves an exploding naked chick covered in blood and an appearance by the virgin Mary. The film is not exactly groundbreaking stuff - Exorcist rip-offs aren't exactly hard to come by - and there are moments that had me laughing out loud (Crowe's mouth transforming into a gaping maw is hilariously bad), but I was never bored.I'm going to be generous and give The Pope's Exorcist 6/10 - not essential viewing, but do we honestly think that David Gordon Green's The Exorcist remake, due out later this year, will be any better?","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Xstal","6 May 2023","Father Gabriel Amorth likes to come forth, to expunge evil with his religious force, if he can get it in a pig, he can soon make a rejig, with a shotgun, and a little bit of mirth. He's been sent over to Spain to take the pain, of poor Henry who's become a touch insane, as he's possessed by unnamed devil, who insults with lots of revel, on a bed they tie him down to keep contained. But this demon is a tricky thing to prise, a real nasty type of thing to exorcise, he's been contained under an abbey, his past keepers look quite shabby, and his sleeves are full of tricks and some surprise. So a battle wages between good and bad, Crowe's accent irritates, might make you mad, nowt you haven't seen before, although it's not really a chore, but it's not all that good either, is all I'll add.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","mDanHam","16 August 2023","My headline sums it up, but IMDb has a minimum character requirement, so here we go (yawn):
Starts out well enough; the setup is OK, atmosphere effective, acting good, story is (initially) intelligent, script literate, and the Catholic stuff is accurate enough that it won't make your head spin 'round. It draws a lot from ""The Exorcist"" and pays homage to that groundbreaking film in several ways, both visually and thematically, and not in a bad way.The story goes beyond a simple possession, and involves a more elaborate plan by the demon that will affect the whole Church. This aspect comes across like an afterthought, though; something contrived to try and put a new and different spin on worn out subject matter.Although the movie is fictionalized, Father Amorth was a real priest. His real name is used, and it's set in the 1980's. So why a generic Pope, rather than John Paul II?! He's obviously not supposed to be JP II, because he sports a beard, which JP did not, and he otherwise reflects none of JP's personality traits. Seems to be a deliberate attempt to distance the movie pontiff from the real Pope. Kind of undermines the whole ""Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth"" claim, wouldn't you say?All of that can be forgiven, however -- after all, it's just a movie. Likewise, I could even forgive the tired, trite, predictable old tie-ins to the Church's alleged past abuses and (haha, quite literally in this case) skeletons in the closet. (Monty Python notwithstanding, EVERYBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition!)So, what goes wrong? Instead of something sensible that aligns with the rest of the movie's realistic tone, the climax wallows in overblown theatrics better suited to Marvel or DC. Is this supposed to be believable, or is it about gods and monsters? Give me a break.Dear Hollywood: Please stop making demonic possession movies. What's that...? Yet ANOTHER one due out later this year?!! Lord, save us.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","joeymcpee","19 April 2023","I've seen worse, and though I wondered if I'd end up walking out due to the film devolving into such a mess that I'd have to remove myself and save my time, I didn't.But, unfortunately, this was ultimately a movie of tropes, recycled themes, copied scenes and even Gollum (from the Lord of the Rings) as our central demoniac.The opening scene was very underwhelming (considering how long this sub-genre has had mainstream representation), though I guess it told the psychological aspect of Crowe's character's discoveries while performing his vocation.And then there were the endless recyclings complete with: growling demon voices, barked obscenities, inverting crosses, heads twisting backwards, crackling joints preceding unnatural crabwalks and whatever else, ceiling crawls that accomplish nothing, windows and mirrors being blown out, priest guilt, symbolism, an old castle with secrets, a rain storm with lightning, priestly whiskey flasks, cgi . . .Ironically the film was mildly interesting at moments and I suppose the ending had a little flare and intrigue though not exactly scary.I think all-in-all the more I endure possession movies I'm more inclined to believe there was Blatty's The Exorcist and not much since, though I'll give the tip of my hat to The Conjuring and Annabelle for being decently creative and scary.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","chand-suhas","6 April 2023","A boy is possessed by a powerful demon when the family shifts into their newly inherited mansion, built over hallowed ground. It is upto the chief exorcist of Vatican to save this family while uncovering the dark secret behind this demon and that mansion. Based on the experiences of a real life exorcist, The Pope's Exorcist tries to be this decade's new Conjuring but it doesn't have enough meat in it to be one.The story is pretty basic and so are the scares but what it lacks is properly establishing the characters. It begins so haphazardly, I for one couldn't care less for the family moving into the new mansion. Sure, there was a personal loss involved, rebellious teenager and a traumatized boy. Even a mother who can fight back a demon to get back her kids safely. But those initial scenes fail to create any concern for the family.It does however show promise with the mystery behind the demon as the priests try to figure out it's name and uncover a dirty Vatican secret. The film somehow revived itself in the second act but the all too generic third act, ensured The Pope's Exorcist was nothing more than an ordinary watch. Russell Crowe gave his best to carry the film forward but even he can do only so much with a screenplay that doesn't try to raise above the routine stuff.","9/10"

I love Russell Crowe's performance no matter where, and I can never miss a good horror movie, and I do enjoy exorcism movies...
STILL
I fell asleep numerous times during the film, and I'm pretty sure I didn't miss much.Russell Crowe's foreign accent was not becoming of him, I think. We're used to seeing him in different kinds of roles. The film had far too much in common with The Exorcist to be taken seriously.I don't know... I really wanted to like it.

"The Pope's Exorcist","Blashma","15 April 2023","The film turns in a new direction compared to most three-cent horror films, the film does not focus too much on jumpscare but focuses on each character's emotions when being invaded by fear.I am very impressed with the plot, in addition to the cool and funny Father Gabriel character, the rest of the characters are also very well built. If you want a movie full of jumpscare then this is not the movie for you, and if you want a jumpscare movie that is just enough and has a compelling plot for you to enjoy then this is the movie for you. Applause for the cast and crew. Don't let the fools keep you from enjoying this movie. They're just kids who like jumpscare and don't like the humor in ''Horror'' movies.The movie is just good enough for the viewer to feel comfortable. Personally, I really enjoyed this movie

"The Pope's Exorcist","ashfordofficial","4 May 2023","As a Screen Gems horror fan I can always rely them on delivering a visually splendid horror film with outstanding VFX, quality aside.Yes, the movie is a jumbled mess and if it wasn't for Russell Crowe with his imposing physicality and screen presence this movie could've collapsed entirely. It's sad to see it's made by the same guy who directed Overlord (2018) and at the same time I'm not surprised because he also directed that horses*it called Samaritan (2022).On a positive side, I loved the abbey setting, the mysteries surrounding it and the historical and biblical connections behind it. It all felt very interesting and impressive. Also I loved the performances of Alex Essoe and Laurel Marsden. The final act was quite entertaining with stunning CGI and creative exorcism concept.Maybe the sequel will be better if they hired a different creative team.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","alfredvankuik","18 April 2023","It's the 80s and Russell Crowe is now an exorcist. He is quirky and excentric. He also ignored a mentally unwell woman who told him she was being sexually abused by a priest but that's okay because he's quirky and excentric so it's okay.Then there's a demon bullying a poor American family and only Russell Crowe can help, so he hops on his Vespa and drives all the way from the Vatican to Spain (I'm not kidding, the movie seriously implies this). He drinks some whiskey and starts talking to the demon. The demon is apparently the king of hell, but he is less active than the average housecat. Despite not being tied down, he mostly just lays on the bed spouting nonsense and puking up baby birds every now and then. The mother doesn't seem too concerned by her son puking up baby birds and soundly sleeps through most of the movie while both her kids are being possessed.The actual exorcism in this movie is slow and inconsistent. Russell Crowe has a Spanish sidekick, another priest with many sins under his belt and who doesn't know how to pray properly. He chokes a kid at one point but it's okay because the kid said something mean to him. They both just stand by Henry's bed and mumble some prayers while the demon shrugs them off and keeps giving everyone cliche horror visions of dead loves ones. There's not a lot of progression to it all besides the forced character arcs of the priests confessing their horrible sins and being washed clean of them way too easily.Then Russell Crowe uses his priest senses to find a hidden well full of skulls from Spanish inquisition victims. He finds this really funny, taking one to throw at people as a funny prank because he is quirky and eccentric. The movie goes out of it's way to say the church was not to blame for the Spanish inquisition because the ones giving the orders were possessed at the time, which of course makes total sense.But back to the exorcism. Russell Crowe finds the demon's name in the magical well of exorcisms past and he goes back up to Henry, who does a few cool party tricks, suddenly being way more active just so the movie can throw in the cliche backwards spider walk. Russell has to be the hero and sacrifices himself to the demon to save the random Americans. This is when his trusty sidekick suddenly becomes competent and runs after Russell Crowe into the magical well of exorcisms past to save him. A truly hilarious encounter ensues where they both hold up a cross and the demon just kind of goes ""oh noes"" and dies. The ending is Disney/Marvel style happy and positive with everything falling into place and even setting up a franchise possibility.The whole movie has an offputting vibe of glorifying the catholic church. The priest characters are terrible human beings, which in itself is fine, but they are portrayed like Marvel style superheroes by the end. On top of this, the random mix of languages gives it an even weirder vibe. Russell Crowe was only paid enough to learn a little bit of Italian so everyone else has to adjust to him because they couldn't just hire an Italian to play an Italian. Even the pope talks English to himself which makes zero sense.The Pope's Exorcist is a mess. It's hilarious at times, but it doesn't feel like it's trying to be. It is mediocre at best at being a horror film and it sucks at everything else. Russell Crowe is okay but the only acting that is truly noteworthy is Peter DeSouza-Feighoney as the possessed kid. He saves this film somewhat from being utter trash.If you're a catholic who wants to see a horror movie that confirms your worldviews, this is for you. If you're anything but that, avoid.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","olcayozfirat","31 May 2023","An exorcism-themed horror movie from 2023. This movie is exactly the same as the exorcism movies ever made. In all of them, the devil enters the child and for some reason he always sleeps in bed like a bedridden. He also makes ""dirty talk"" to the priests in various fantasies. I guess he's having a hard time thinking of anything different. Here, I think, the real experiences of someone named Father Gabriel are mentioned.So why watch this movie? Sure watch for Russell Crowe. He is watched for his funny gestures and sometimes for his funny moves.

"The Pope's Exorcist","johnhsmith-00056","13 September 2023","What a ride! Russell Crowe playing an Italian priest. Pretty good accent too.So we have a LOT of great story arcs crammed into this film. A story about a boy's father who died, and problems the boy has had since then. A major incident during the Spanish Inquisition that was covered up by the Church. Two priests with major guilt in their pasts. Father Amorth dealing with Vatican politics, and of course, a challenging and horrific exorcism. Each one of these storylines could have been a film in itself, so that's a lot of information to shoehorn into 103 minutes. And it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I would have rather seen these stories fleshed out a bit into a series.A lot of reviews are complaining that the film uses a lot of other exorcism tropes from various films. Well, it does, but to be fair, some of that is because this is a film about Gabriele Amorth, whose life inspired many of those other films. It's flawed, but overall highly recommended.","7/10"

He was like the top gun exorcist of the Vatican Church-who only answered to the Pope himself-and usually could tell pretty soon if a possession was real or something else, like a mental disorder or a fake. This story is about a young boy's possession. Russell plays Gabriele-who likes to travel by a Vespa motorcycle-Franco is the Pope and Peter is the boy with the unwanted inhabitant. Peter's family move to an inherited castle in Italy but unbeknownst to them, it's got buried secrets inside, one being a demon living in the basement that goes for Peter. When Daniel-the local priest-can not handle Peter's possession, Russell is called in to help but Russell soon learns of past situations that effect the present. One of them being a conspiracy that the Vatican has been hiding.It's rated R for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.It's not a bad horror movie-it was kind of interesting-and would be a good one to stream.","1/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","iamtherobotman","4 May 2023","If you've seen any film, ever about possession and exorcism, then you won't see anything new in this.The standard 'rogue' Priest and his 'doubting Thomas' sidekick are present here. So too is the expected 'victim' of the possession being bedridden and covered in scratches. Lets not forget also the gravelly voice of the 'Demon', because clearly ALL Demons have to speak like they've smoked 100 cigarettes a day for the last 40,000 years.There really was nothing new in all of this, perhaps with the exception of Crowe's renegade Priest riding a Vespa, that was new.We even had the obligatory thunder storms, dozens of lights everywhere, but the rooms remaining in relative darkness...

"The Pope's Exorcist","littlesatanhooves","5 May 2023","Let it be said once and for all that there will never be another movie on the rituals of Christian exorcism after The Exorcist (1973). After you have seen the original, you have seen them all, no matter how hard they try to make one different from another. I must say that I had a lot of expectations riding on 'The Pope's Exorcist', but after a few minutes into the movie, I lost all hope for something new, something different, something more exciting. It wasn't a bad movie actually. It's just that it tried to be more than another movie about demonic possession but like I said, you cannot stretch the premise any much further than what The Exorcist (1973) already achieved.

"The Pope's Exorcist","andresbrito-imdb","19 April 2023","In an official statement, the International Association of Exorcists states that the movie ""instills the belief that exorcism is an abnormal, monstrous, and terrifying phenomenon, whose only protagonist is the demon, whose violent reactions can be faced with great difficulty. This is exactly the opposite of what happens in the context of exorcism celebrated in the Catholic Church in obedience to its directives.""The IAE adds that ""The Pope's Exorcist is contrary to historical reality, distorts and falsifies what is truly lived and experienced during the exorcism of truly possessed individuals. Moreover, it is offensive regarding the state of suffering in which those who are victims of an extraordinary action of the demon find themselves. Exorcism is an extremely joyful event because, while there is a vivid experience of the presence and action of Christ the Lord.""It is not necessary to point out that, once again, Hollywood spreads historical nonsenses about the supposedly evil Spanish Inquisition.

"The Pope's Exorcist","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","18 July 2023","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulAfter the death of her husband, Julia Vasquez (Alex Essoe) and her children, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) and Amy (Laurel Marsden) head off to Spain to renovate an old church, only for Henry to become seemingly possessed by a demonic entity. The Vatican enlists the help of Father Gabriel Amorth (Russell Crowe), an unconventional priest who is still reeling from attempting to perform a previous exorcism that went devastatingly wrong. Along with his assistant Father Tomas Esquibel (Daniel Zovato), he tries to have better luck with Henry, but obfuscation from the Vatican seeks to stand in his way.Helped in no small part by his Hell-raising off screen persona, Russell Crowe naturally lends himself to parts with an element of the reckless, play-by-his-own-rules maverick type, in this case a priest no less, in this supernaturally themed thriller from director Julius Avery, allegedly based on true events, and pointing a wider accusatory finger at the already much maligned internal practices of the Catholic Church. His performance seems to be the most hailed aspect of this production by everyone who's seen it, and it does carry the restrained intensity to it that he has made his own over time. And yes, it probably is the best thing to say about this otherwise unfortunate horror entry.Themes of religious damnation and Satanic possession have been key themes of the horror genre since back in its heyday, with films such as Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, and even the church restoration subplot feels like a nod to 1973's Don't Look Now, so Avery's film has something of a foundation to build itself on. Sadly, on execution, it plays out unremarkably like a standard modern day horror film, loaded with cheap jump scares and overwrought exposition, with nothing to make it get under the skin in any deeper, more meaningful way than any other such film, with only Crowe's inner conflicts to really distract in any true way.The Exorcist it ain't. **","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","IonicBreezeMachine","3 May 2023","Set in 1987, following the death of her husband, Julia Vasquez (Alex Essoe) relocates to Castile, Spain with her teenage daughter Amy (Laurel Marsden) and young son Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney), who has been mute since the death of his father, to restore an Abbey that her husband owned to sell off to alleviate the loss of income. Eventually, Henry begins exhibiting odd fits and disturbing behavior that medical professionals aren't able to explain which leads to local priest Father Tomas Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto) relaying the situation to The Vatican where The Pope (Franco Nero) sends his chief exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth (Russell Crowe) to investigate where he stumbles upon a long buried conspiracy by the Vatican that could spell the Church's destruction.The Pope's Exorcist is loosely based on the real life of Father Gabriele Amorth (in that there was a real exorcist named Gabriele Amorth which is pretty much where the similarities end). The movie features most of the well known tropes and trappings that are part and parcel to this type of genre ""exorcise"", but despite how well worn these tropes are Russell Crowe does add an off beat sense of humor and charm to the all too familiar material.The biggest issue that faces The Pope's Exorcist is the fact that much like many other exorcism movies, it owes a great deal to the 1973 film The Exorcist which established all the various iconography and tropes that have been revisited time and time again in not only certain follow-ups to The Exorcist, but also the various derivatives of it. This is a very well-trodden formula and while director Julius Avery does try to add some flair and intensity to the material, it is basically the same beats we saw with the possession of Regan in The Exorcist complete with all the swearing, scarring, and vomiting you've come to expect. The movie does try to expand on the material by incorporating things about the Vatican's shame from the Spanish Inquistion or sexual abuse by the clergy, but it rather tastelessly tries to say that these were the work of demons trying to pervert the institutions of the church and it sort of feels like a cop-out for predatory behavior and seems really tone deaf to bring it up at all.In the middle of all of this is a pretty entertaining performance by Russell Crowe as Father Gabriele Amorth and the fact that he plays this character very jovially with a likable air around him does enliven much of the more leaden parts of the movie that feel ""been there done that"". Franco Nero also has a brief supporting bit as The Pope and while good to see him, he does feel a little squandered in this movie but there are probably plans to include him in a follow-up as the ending seems to be setting up a franchise.The Pope's Exorcism is basically just another exorcism movie that owes many of its tricks and tropes to the forebearers of the subgenre, most notably The Exorcist. Russell Crowe's central performance is quite likable and engaging, it's just a shame he's left to carry a very generic and not all that interesting story.","8/10"

People might not like that it is not that scary, or at least for me it was not. I would really want to see Russell more in this character, it suits him. He is funny, loyal and he knows things, but in good way. I like the end where it was taken because it has options for another movies.

"The Pope's Exorcist","paulclaassen","4 October 2023","By now there are probably just as many exorcism movies out there as there are zombie or vampire movies. It becomes difficult to distinguish between them, especially with most exorcism movies being so similar, and all of them following the same pattern. My favourites are still 'The Exorcist' and 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose'.Russell Crowe stars as real-life Father Gabriele Amorth, who supposedly performed thousands of exorcisms. This is but one of his stories. He is a bit unorthodox in his methods and his (much younger) superiors does not really believe in demons - or evil for that matter - anymore. They seek logical explanations for strange occurrences and events attributed to possession and demons.Recently widowed Julia inherited an abbey in the countryside of Spain. She moves there with her young son Henry - who hasn't spoken a word in over a year since his dad died - and her rebellious teenage daughter Amy. Julia hopes to restore the abbey in order to sell it.However, soon after moving in, Henry is possessed by a powerful demon. Hearing about this, the Pope sends Gabriele to see Henry. What happens next, is pretty much what happens in almost every exorcist movie - the exorcist tries to determine who the demon is, the demon refuses to leave, the exorcist tries to save the victim. Same old, same old. Yet, despite this familiar pattern, I do love watching exorcism movies. Why? I enjoy the contortion effects, the make-up, and the good versus evil premise.I thought Russell Crowe was rather good as Father Gabriele. The climax in 'The Pope's Exorcist' also dishes up and serve more than just a fair share of CGI, but it was all good. Although 'The Pope's Exorcist' is a good movie in its own right, in time I might forget what it is about with the myriad of possession movies out there, and this one not offering anything to elevate it above the rest.","7/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","SoumikBanerjee1996","3 May 2023","""The boy is showing all the classical signs of possession""
""What are the signs of possession?""
""He Converses in English, Father""The film turned out to be the complete opposite of what I initially assumed; the script deviated from the set expectations and ventured into territories that did not seem consequential. The tonality is all over the place here; not only did the story fail to convince me of the horror, but at times the writing made the situation comical.Was that unintentional or deliberate? Hard to come to a conclusion! Thus, the plot lacked coherence and failed to establish a clear direction. Additionally, the characters were underdeveloped and lacked depth, making it difficult to empathise with their conditions.My only query is why you felt the need to inject humour into a film that was intended to be conventional horror. The atmosphere is ruined, the plot's core is destroyed, and the consequences have an adverse impact on the outcome. The only thing I can state in favour of ""The Pope's Exorcist"" is that I admired Russell Crowe and whatever he did here, but other than that, I found it to be mostly intolerable.","5/10"

Until he comes across a demon that is putting him to the test. The plot is forgettable. About a mother and her two children moving to italy. Until the son gets possessed which Crowe comes in to help save the boy.Russell Crowe did great. The rest of the cast ensemble is a bit forgettable with bland performances. The direction does lack scares and thrills. Besides the demons voice coming from the boy seemed more cheesy than frightening. This is one film that misses its mark in being scary.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","The-Sarkologist","4 February 2024","I'm not sure why I actually wanted to see this film. Probably because it starred Russel Crowe, and that it was based on a true story. Mind you, I suspect that when they say that it is based on a true story, it is using the term in probably the loosest way imaginable. However, there are some things in relation to this film that do stand out, even if you could pretty much say that it is just another of the many remakes of The Exorcist (which I have to admit I haven't seen it, and I probably should make a decent effort to rectify that).Anyway, the movie is about a real person upon whose diaries, that were published, were an inspiration. Probably the only two truths about the film is that there was a chief exorcist for the Pope with that name, and that a lot of the things that he does comes down to determining whether it is a real demon or just mental illness. I suspect the main part of the film, particularly with the diabolical plan to take over the world, and that Russell Crowe is the only one who and stop it, is mostly fabricated.Look, I'm one of those people that do believe in a spiritual reality, and that there is a significant connection between metal illness and demon possession. Mind you, I wouldn't be encouraging people to use an exorcist to go around curing mental illness, in the same way that I wouldn't be writing off demon possession as simply mental illness. My issue though is that mental illness is a catch all thing that people seem to over diagnose, or use to attempt to extract sympathy for them.In the end though I can't really say whether this is a great film or not. I guess it is okay, but it isn't something that I'm really going to be raving about. Mind you, I personally cannot claim to be an expert in demon possession (and I would certainly be treating anybody who claims to be with an incredible amount of suspicion), but I suspect a bulk of the things in this film are Hollywood dramatisation. Personally, I certainly wouldn't be using this as a guide - especially considering a specific scene in Acts.","3/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","Pairic","12 April 2023","The Pope's Exorcist: ""That'a beautiful pig."" Only the best, Father."" Chief Vatican Exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth (Russell Crowe) uses porcine props as he casts out demons Gadarene Swine style in Italy in 1987. But 98% of ""possessions"" are due to mental illness he explains to a Vatican panel afterwards. He puts an arrogant young US Cardinal in his place, reminding him that only the Pope issues orders to Amorth. Indeed the Pope (JPII) sens Amorth to Spain where an American mother, teen daughter and young son are having troubles in an Old abbey the mother was having restored. This is a stock family, caring worried mother, sullen teen who doesn't want to be there but the boy, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) shines as he becomes the subject of a Demon's attention. Some great scenes of horror as the possessed child tosses priests through doors, chokes people and causes Poltergeist effects. Also alarming is the way the demon tempts and taunts those around him with memories of their past sins and failures. We even get the spider walk, But something far more sinister is going on, the Pope (Franco Nero) researches old documents regarding the Abbey's history whilst Amorth is his field commander in the fightagainst Satan. Crowe has an endearing, humerous style as he portrays Amorth, wisecracking, irreverent, fond of coffee and the odd nip of whiskey. DeSouza-Feighoney deftly goes through a demanding performance as the possessed boy with Ralph Ineson voicing the demon. My favourite scene was the Pope projectile vomiting blood on to the US Cardinal. A lot more fiction than fact here but it's a highly entertaining horror film even if it would have been better with a 90 minute running time rather than 103. Directed by Julius Avery, from a screenplay by Michael Petroni and Evan Spiliotopoulos based on Amorth's memoirs An Exorcist Tells His Story and An Exorcist: More Stories. 7.5/10.","3/10"

For one thing, the movie felt like it was at least 2 hours long. For another, and more importantly, the movie was not scary or suspenseful at any, really absolutely any, point in time. I really wonder who gets creeped out by a movie like this? Simply boring unfortunately. In addition, the special effects were sometimes insanely weak. I read that it was Russell Crowes first horror film and I hope it was also his last. It seemed more like a parody than a horror movie.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","alex-mott","28 May 2023","Russell Crowe delivers a solid performance as the Vatican's bad boy, Father Gabriel Amorth, but what an actor like him is doing anywhere near this kind of production is a mystery. Money could have been saved by casting a lesser-known actor as the lead and it still wouldn't have made a great deal of difference to this film's overall appeal. It's definitely entertaining but because it's not as disturbing as The Exorcist or as intriguing as The Da Vinci Code, it offers nothing new in either genre and settles somewhere in the middle, as a well produced but slightly puzzling mix of horror and popcorn (with explosions). 'Let's go to work' Amorth says when the true extent of his mission is revealed just before the credits roll - presumably meaning there will be 199 sequels.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","bishysbus","5 May 2023","If you can put up with Russell Crowe's attempt at an Italian accent, or was it Spanish, or French? üòÇ That coupled with poor overdubbing of the demon's voice on the boy makes this a terrible film.Overlong and slow, not even atmospheric which is where slow movies conquer.It is an all too-complicated story that the average cinema goer will lose track of after about 30 mins.Russell Crowe has never managed to revive his success of 'Gladiator' and he isn't going to do so with films like this.To understand the script you actually have to be a qualified exorcist yourself, and know every verse of the bible inside out.

"The Pope's Exorcist","Vivekmaru45","3 May 2023","Indeed the New Zealand actor has come a long way from Romper Stomper. You should also see other exorcism movies like Possessed(2000) and The Haunting In Conneticut(2009). Then there are two versions of the prequel to The Exorcist(Dominion and Exorcist The beginning). The Legend Of Hell House(1973) is another good movie along with The Changeling(1980) and The Woman In Black(1989). It should be remembered that The Exorcist is a trilogy and William Peter Blatty directed the last one himself to show the true vision of his books.This movie is about a boy who is possessed by a demon who specifically targets priest Gabriele Amorth(played by Crowe) who is the chief exorcist of the Vatican. So the movie deals with the ritual of exorcism that is condemned by the Vatican and rarely given permission to perform it. I won't reveal more of the plot, watch the film and find out what happens...Verdict: I was impressed with the photography and sound-effects. The CGI effects are commonplace these days compared to big budget CGI movies. The acting by Crowe is decent. He reminds me a lot of the late actor Oliver Reed who ironically starred alongside him in Gladiator. Crowe has aged now, but not so badly. He can still offer a decent acting performance. The performance he gave in Unhinged(2020) disturbs me till this day.Check out the above movies along with Burnt Offerings 1976, Poltergeist 1982, Haunted 1995, Stir Of Echoes 1999, The Haunting 1999, What Lies Beneath 2000, Thir13en Ghosts 2001.

"The Pope's Exorcist","GusherPop","18 April 2023","The Pope's Exorcist is a film that combines the two images of a gunslinger and a priest. Russell Crowe plays Father Gabriele Amorth, a theologian, journalist, book author, and the pope's designated exorcist. Amorth is a sly, tough, wisecracking priest who approaches each mission like a gunslinger, carrying an exorcism kit with crucifixes and holy water in a case the size of a saddlebag. His horse is a red-and-white scooter that is too-small for Crowe's character-actor body, but makes a perfect sight gag for that reason. Amorth also has a tiny whiskey flask that he insists on carrying to ease his scratchy throat. The film is written and performed like one of those wry, hard-bitten bad-asses that used to be played in 1960s Westerns by aging but still-popular action stars like Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, and John Wayne. The most important details in this text are that Russell Crowe has been so good for so long that he glides through this role as if he has nothing to prove. He goesofs around and adds surprising little gestures and reactions to enliven a scene, but never goes so far that he seems to be making fun of the movie. When Amorth discloses his own spiritual torment in a series of flashbacks, Crowe plays it straight, suffering and writhing as if he's in an Ingmar Bergman movie. He seems to be at roughly the same career point as Paul Newman in the early 1970s when his hair went silver and he lost most of his vanity. Even when a scene is serious, he's having fun. Crowe plays Amorth as a prideful cut-up, greeting vile taunts with a deadpan smirk and snappy answers. He is even more appealing when he lets the audience see his insecurities that the priest keeps hidden. The Pope's Exorcism is a horror movie that explores the depths of an increasingly stale exorcism horror subgenre. Russell Crowe is hammier than an Easter dinner as Father Gabriele Amorth, spitting out Italianized dialogue that Chris Pratt could learn from for the inevitable Super Mario Bros. Sequel. The movie is a mood board movie that favors chunked-off ideas over a cohesive whole, making it a mood board movie that favors chunked-off ideas over a cohesive whole. Those who want something profound will be doomed, while those who love to laugh through questionable pulp that aims to entertain might find more enlightenment than they expect. When Father Esquibel tells Amorth that he's read his articles about possession in magazines, Amorth mentions that he writes books, too. When Avery cuts to traveling shots of Amorth on his scooter, the frock, collar, fedora, and sunglasses make the character iconic: coolly ridiculous and ridiculously cool. The Pope's Exorcist is a possession movie that tries to be everything from The Exorcist to Men in Black, with barely mixed results. Russell Crowe plays Rome's Chief Exorcist with an Italian accent cracked from a can of Chef Boyardee. Director Julius Avery indulges the freakier elements of demonic overtakings with a B-movie sensibility, much like how he turned the massively enjoyable Overlord into a freakish WWII monster mash. This approach hits almost as much as it misses, but at least when scenes work, The Pope's Exorcist is an unintentional horror-comedy that doesn't try to be anything other than an aggression-forward religious nightmare that taunts saints and torments sinners.","6/10"

The best part is Russel Crowe's dynamic performance as the Pope's Exorcist, an Italian Priest with a belief in Demons, a love of coffee, and a good sense of humor.

"The Pope's Exorcist","maddison-59657","3 May 2023","Anytime I see a movie with Russell Crowe starring in it, I always will watch it as he is such a brilliant Actor. This movie seemed interesting to me as it was supposedly based on a real person, so I decided to watch it. What a massive disappointment. As usual Russell Crowe's performance was really good, however it doesn't make up for a really rubbish movie. The rest of the cast, if that is what you can call them, were just dreadful and can'y act. It is like the Casting Agent went down to the local Supermarket and just picked out people from random to be in this movie. Their performances are wooden and not believable at all. As for the movie, the way that the Director headed with this was just a joke. Obviously he had stolen scenes from the 1973 movie ""The Exorcist"" starring Lina Blair (which is probably the scariest movie that I have ever seen!), and failed miserably due to the poor acting ability of the rest of the cast. It was more of a comedy than a Horror. If you would like my honest opinion then don't bother with this movie and watch the 1973 ""The Exorcist"" movie if you are looking for a real scare.If you do decide to watch it, then please leave Feedback.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","pkhall1","19 August 2023","Crowe's acting was excellent. I thought he really did a great job. The problem was, however, that the story was just frankly ridiculous, and no matter how good someone is of an actor when you put them in a vehicle such as this, it's just an accident waiting to happen. I thought that the priest, who accompanied Father Gabriele was just an OK actor until the last scene he was in. I think the biggest problem with the movie was the fact that the young boy simply could not act. Every single scene that he was in I just felt he ruined if you're going to have a movie with subject matter such as this you really need to make sure that that character that the whole thing is centered around is really awesome in the role. Unfortunately, it was a tragic performance.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","adrianhextall","11 April 2023","Inspired by rather than a retelling of a particular story does of course give the script writers and film makers far more freedom to do what they want rather than being trapped by the constraints of a story like the Amityville Horror.The story starts along the same lines as The Conjuring, the remote location, the family newly moving into the property to start afresh but this moves the location from outback USA to outback Spain.It's a neat move as it allows the scripts to focus on elements such as the Spanish Inquisition, the Catholic Church and more and keep the story grounded in some semblance of history and mythology surrounding religion.Russell Crowe does a great job as a wise, weary Priest (the Pope's own appointed Exorcist) and alongside the local Spanish Priest who unsurprisingly has no idea how to deal with a possession within his own community, the pair work together well. Their scenes are reminiscent of the pairing from the Exorcist (1973) with the older, knowledgeable one guiding the younger, more reticent one who believes but doesn't quite fully believe what is going on.The pacing of the story works well, the young actor playing the possessed boy deserves multiple supporting actor awards as he really carries the underlying feel of tension and threat.It all builds up to a satisfying climatic conclusion and comes recommended for anyone wanting a little more of the same with a modern take on how to present it all.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","avindugunasinghe","1 January 2024","A detective of the church waging war against an evil that feeds on it's kind, the story is more of a thriller with a pinch of horror which is quite a remarkable balance between two different genres. Great visuals with a fitting set-up to support the story. Unique special effey. A little more dig up into the family's story would have been excellent. No sound effect stood out apart from the knock yet the it was sufficient. Great performance by Russell Crowe pulling off the controversial character with equally great work done by the rest of the crew. It's not a typical horror story rather a investigative tale..","10/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","specialgirl-1","25 August 2023","This is the best movie I've seen this year forget that it's horror...the story is SO GOOD!!Russell Crowe has me believing I'm watching a real Italian priest. FLAWLESS. I have watched the film more than once and I'm still interested & impressed every time.All the characters are wonderfully cast and believable.The story is so interesting I just said it to research a little about the real Father Amorph The actual Pope's Exorcist. His favorite movie was THE EXORCIST!!All very interesting. I rarely get on here to jury view but this movie deserves all the TEN stats I've given it.I can't wait to see the sequel.10 STARS all the way.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","lakeshore-98711","13 June 2023","Well, I found the movie disjointed, repetitive, just like many hundreds of movies since The Exorcist, as others have said, the effects are good, but the movie just had nothing in it, it jumped from scene to scene with no apparent continuity and never explained why the family was living iin an ancient dump of a convent, cathedral or what was it, that is just totally unbelievable, I try to never mention spoilers, but for the priests to find what they did in ""the basement"" is just laughable, I like Russell, but he must have needed a quid to take this drivel on is sad, when compared to ""Master and Commander"" and, to a lesser extent, """"Gladiator."" and many of his earlier movies where his acting was outstanding, is tragic. He is still quite young enough to get himself back into shape, which may be why he was offered this part, where his weight is hidden by a black robe, please, Russ, get back to some semblance of fitness. His skin colour is quite healthy now, so it looks like he may have conquered cigarettes, which gave him the smokers grey skin for many years. I was not impressed with the movie at all, although Father Amorth was a real person who did much good work in his lifetime.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","pjkblue-35926","17 August 2023","Jeez, another muddling movie about the church, demons and possession. This was totally bad to the point of being laughable.Always good to see the pre-adolescent boy become this monster of the underworld, but he can't seem to get out of bed.The mother and are tossed into walls, mirrors and shelving but they somehow manage to escape any bodily injury, same for the younger priest who right from the get-go was flipped across a room and crashed into a glass armoire/cabinet in a hallway.And how about the lights? No one brought any sufficient lighting?No LED bulbs? Everything has a dark orange tint.No one eats? No one goes to the bathroom? I can understand the ""evil one"" not having to do such routine things, but the other humans...""got no time for that!""
Anyway, this was a pay day for the cast and crew.Amen.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","sineadc-74511","2 May 2023","SPOILERS AHEADAfter watching the trailer I just KNEW this film was going to be the same old tired clich√© possession movie: family move into new place, child gets possessed, child speaks in an not-in-the-least-bit scary English accent and swears a whole lot, priest uses a cross and some prayers, lights flicker, some people get thrown around the room, someone crab walks on the ceiling, demon possesses priest but he manages to defeat it despite how powerful the demon supposedly is, and then all happy families again.This film is just Hollywood garbage. There is nothing new here - it has just taken the same ideas from every possession horror movie from the last 40 years.

"The Pope's Exorcist","irusvirus","24 May 2023","A well-made exorcist film that doesn't deliver anything new either. Russell Crowe is wonderful to look at and really takes his role seriously. I buy every single verse of the Bible! Yes, even the often criticized by me CGI effects are mostly well implemented in this film. Towards the end, the movie really turns up the heat, which is why I often sat there shaking my head and grinning and thinking ""WTF, now it's really going down!"" ü§£ I also keep imagining how it is for the actors when they are made up into a demon and then have to perform like that. I'm sure everyone involved had a huge amount of fun making the film. I would be really interested in a making-of. From my point of view a good exorcist movie that you can watch, so I give it 5/10 stars. May God forgive me this rating üôèüòáüòà","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","miuragikenuser","31 May 2023","It is just interesting that Russell Crowe is the star of this movie. So far, I dont remember watching Mr Crowe in a Horror movie. I remember Gladiator and Beautiful Mind... both are drama movies.The movie has a basic storyline. A boy is possesed and A priest must come to save him. To be honest, this movie is not scary enough. I dont like movies that jump scare the audience. But it lacks the suspense that other horror movies have.The ending is so predictable and the dialogue is not interesting. Mr Crowe did OK but the other characters are not. Sometimes it feels like watching a youtube video with some kids going into a haunted house. Yeah I mean the Jokes..... Dry Jokes. Not necessary for creating the creepy situations in the movie.Thank you for reading....","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","moviemanmo973","24 April 2023","This was a bland movie. There wasn't anything unique or entertaining about this. It's the same possession type movie you've seen before with a different title and actors. The same cliches and possession symptoms. All the actors performances were okay although I could not take the possessed boy seriously in any of his scenes. The demonic voice they gave him was just very comical and it didn't suit him well at all. He was not frightening or intimidating. He just looked like a sick kid.The scenes where the character ""Rosaria"" was used as an illusion could have been improved, they felt cheap. This movie didn't provide any terror or thrills. There was some questionable CGI. Overall this movie should have never been considered for a movie theater experience.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","nogodnomasters","26 April 2023","The film is inspired by the life of Father Gabriel Amorth, who was a famous exorcist. Russell Crowe played a convincing Italian priest, mostly because he doesn't have to sing. I still hold a Les Mis√©rables grudge. We see him performing an exorcism on a boy he does not believe is really possessed in June of 1987. In a subplot in July, Julie (Alex Essoe) from America is fixing up an old estate she inherited from her husband. She is there with her teen daughter Amy (Laurel Marsden) who would rather be anywhere but here and her son Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) who has not talked since watching his father impaled in a traffic accident. An incident causes Henry to have convulsions. The local priest (Daniel Zovatto) who has his own issues, believes Henry needs an exorcist after getting tossed out of the room. We later discover the demon's name is none other than Asmodeus and he wants the soul of the Father Amorth.If you saw the original Exorcist film, you pretty much know how the ritual goes and the profanity that is used. Even though things were ""predictable"" as far as the exorcist genre, I loved the ending basement scene with the use of flaming symbols.Guide F-word. No sex. Nudity (Bianca Bardoe, Carrie Munro)","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","karinahatem","14 May 2023","Don't understand some of the good reviews being one of the best exorcist movie ! This was so boring that I slept during middle of the movie. If Russel was trying to portray the really character, then he did a very bad job, and with that accent, it was just silly. Bad performance from everyone including Russel. If this was based on actual events, then they did a very bad job. There was nothing scary about the movie, and like I mentioned before, was so boring, that I fall asleep. Good thing I didn't spend any money. It is sad to see Russel acting in such bad movies lately, it sure what happened, though wish him the best.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","m-abtahi","28 January 2024","I recently watched the 2023 horror film ""The Pope's Exorcist,"" and it falls into the horror genre, sparking comparisons with other films in the same category, according to critics.What caught my attention was the film's unique focus on the seriousness of exorcism within the context of religious traditions. Unlike some, it neither denies nor dismisses the traditional aspects of exorcism but rather portrays traditionalists realizing the need to renounce the era of dogmatic scrutiny and excessive rigidity that has tarnished the Church's reputation.The plot takes a turn as the exorcist priest discovers a place, presumed to be the devil's lair, where documents from the era of the Church's extremism are found. The artistic solution presented in the film suggests a cinematic and creative approach to absolving the Church from its past extremism, symbolically placing it on the shoulders of Satan.Ultimately, the film serves as a historical reminder that there must always be those willing to shoulder the responsibility for mistakes. Interestingly, even the priests opposing exorcism refuse to undertake this responsibility, revealing the complex dynamics within the film's world.This cinematic creation, directed by Julius Evory and starring Russell Crowe as the exorcist priest Gabriel Amorth, offers a unique perspective on the clash between tradition and reform within the Christian faith.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","True_Reviews","27 September 2023","This is a decent movie. Entertaining and basically a new adaptation of the old Exorcist movie from 1973. While based on a real character the story is completely made up but at least entertaining. If you like horror type movies this may be ideal for you. Any while it is not a great movie, it is heads and shoulders above much of the awful PC garbage that Hollywood produces these days. Russell Crowe is quite good as Father Gabriel Amorth as is Franco Nero who plays the Pope in this movie. While I can live without some of the silliness like a possessed person crawling around like a spider, the movie is still entertaining, which is the reason we watch movies in the first place.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","masonsaul","11 July 2023","It's not even remotely scary and operates exclusively on tropes that have been done better elsewhere but The Pope's Exorcist remains dumb fun mainly thanks to the fact that it operates like a buddy cop film almost as much as it is a generic possession film resulting in a lot of hilarious moments, intentional or otherwise.Russel Crowe is the main reason any of this works. Everything about his performance, including his reliably dodgy accent, is so entertaining and if this role was in the hands of an actor doing an actually good performance the film would be so boring. His jokes are also really funny and he's generally much more jovial than expected.Julius Avery tries to make the stale scares more dynamic with lots of movement and it works. It helps that what the scares lack in terror they make up for in how gross they can be and it's run time flies by. The soundtrack surprisingly has some 80s rock gems, they're only present for a few seconds but the film would still be weaker without them.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","manuelasaez","17 August 2023","Let's face it, Exorcist movies are the same no matter who makes them, especially when they center around Catholicism's ideas of demons and hell. Aside from there being accounts of demonic possession in every culture and almost every religion, they continue to focus on Catholicism's lame interpretation of it and at this point, it's laughable. The same basic setup, the same priests spewing the same nonsense verbatim (and i'm not talking about the actual words of God and Bible. Those are not nonsense, at all). You'd think they'd make a story concerning any other Christian sect or denomination, for varieties sake, but they continue to choose this one. Pentecostals, for example, have an exorcism a week in any church, and you don't need clearance from any ""pope"" to perform them. Anyone with a solid and infallible faith can exercise a demon. Why they haven't made a movie about this is baffling to me, but I digress....This movie is a very paint-by-numbers exorcism movie. Rogue priest, possessed child, demon calls for said priest, exorcism is performed, everyone survives, end of movie. This formula is the same one that most people, including myself, are absolutely exhausted by. There is nothing to differentiate this movie from the dozens of catholic exorcism films that have come before it, except....this movie like a freaking Michael Bay movie.People are thrown all over the place, people float, projectile blood, explosions. I'm surprised there wasn't a scene where the exorcist jumped over an explosion in a Motorcycle. Even the script was like a Bay movie; so many one-liners and attempts at comedy, that I didn't know whether to be concerned or to actually laugh. Demonic possession should never be comical, but I guess that's where society is right now, isn't it? I mean, Satan is everywhere these days, so why shouldn't he poke fun at himself?I watched the movie in its entirety not because I liked the movi (and I rolled my eyes more times than I could count while watching it), but because of its absurdity. It's like watching that one drunk girl at a party; you kind of feel sorry for her, since you've seen so many like her before, but you'll be damned if you aren't watching her make every mistake all the others have made while you check off each one in an imaginary list. This movie was validation that Hollywood continues to be a creatively bankrupt cesspool of nonsense, and just because a movie gets you to see it all the way to the very end, it doesn't mean the movie was actually good. I will probably forget everything that happened in a few months time, and that kind of amnesia is welcomed.Watch this is you want to see what an Exorcism film would look like if it was directed by the guy who does the John Wick movies. Everyone else, avoid this. You won't remember anything about it after a few months, either.If you want a real interested and unique movie about demonic possession, watch the South Korean movie The Priests. Than one is actually very well made and actually scary.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","LordCommandar","3 May 2023","Child possession films are played out and tired now. For me nothing will ever come close to the horror classics of 1967s Rosemary's Baby 1973 Exorcist or 1976 Omen or even 1980 the Fog. The Pope's Exorcist was kinda silly (Crowe made it watchable) but a passable one time and forget about watch. A mother and her two children move into somewhat of home type castle in Spain only to discover that the within the walls lies an evil demon which takes over her son (of course, been there done that in how many films already?) Anyway Russel Crowe the popes exorcist is sent for by the demon and sent forth by the church to investigate. He arrives at the home, the CGI on the demon possessed little boy goes into full effect, yada yada yada, you kinda know how the story ends. It felt more black comedy than horror (my opinion) and special effects bordered on the likes of the film Drag me to hell. Watch once and call it a day.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","waterietarte","26 October 2023","I love horror and particularly the haunted house/possessed child category. The Exorcist chilled me with its slow-developing horror, and when the eponymous series/sequel came out, it built on the mythology and included creepy sub-plots involving the Vatican and heart-wrenching moments as characters you had grown fond of were tortured by demons.This is not that.The Pope's Exorcist is a Greatest Hits of exorcism movie tropes, assembled clumsily around a thin plot and characters that are no more than copy-pasted archetypes (Newbie Priest, Widowed Mother, Rebellious Teen, Innocent Boy). Except for Father Gabriele, who comes off as a parody of a superhero: larger than life, cracking jokes, and going ""cuckoo"" at people as if that's somehow endearing. Apparently in-universe it is, because all the cardinals envy him while the Pope adores him so much that he somehow gets sick/possessed when Father Gabriele is in danger.If you're the kind of stickler who reads the trivia pages of movies (ie, me) you'll notice an avalanche of factual errors. The setting looks like anything but Castille, the Spaniards look anything but Spanish, characters randomly switch to English during important meetings in the Vatican (where Latin was the official language in 1987), and speaking of 1987... apart from some old cars/scooters and a Walkman, it absolutely doesn't feel like 1987. The MRI machine (with laser beams!) in the antiquated Spanish hospital in the middle of nowhere was particularly jarring.You could forgive these things if the rest of the movie wasn't both boring and just really silly. Several pivotal moments in the plot depend on the characters, including Father Gabriele, behaving like incompetent idiots. In general the plot seems to be built around special effects or ""scary"" tropes that needed to be included, and so these moments are brought about in contrived ways and are easy to predict. There is no suspense or tension, just the occasional gross-out moment.Then there's the possessed child. I see what they were going for: he has big innocent eyes and would work perfectly well as a Scary Little Kid. But he's not given any opportunity to actually be creepy before they cover him in weird makeup (Gollum) and dub him over (with very bad lip-sync) with the voice of a Disney Villain who literally goes ""rarrrrr"" when he's trying to roar scarily at characters. That is pretty much the scope of his power. ""Rarrr, I'm so evil"".I gave this 2 stars, because it did make me cringe and laugh, but unfortunately I cringed at the jokes and laughed at the ""scary"" scenes, which isn't what you're looking for when watching a horror movie.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","jbrbsmom","16 September 2023","And just how can an exorcism movie be a snore fest? It was a challenge for them, with all the high budget pyrotechnics, but they managed. More money should have been spent on some of the dime store demon make up...I have seen better masks in elementary school Halloween parades.Even Russell Crowe couldn't save this one, and it doesn't seem he tried all that hard. He looks depressed rather than scared throughout most of the movie.I guessed the ending while the beginning credits were still rolling and was highly disappointed to be completely correct. Not even an intriguing plot twist...was that because they fear audiences are just too slow to follow anything but the most basic of overused of plots or even the writers are just done with this dull demonic exorcism themes that revolves around a lot of bad over dubbed vocals and people spewing huge amounts of vomitis everywhere.I truly stopped even caring what was happening and was glad the movie finally ended which, I hope, was NOT the ended aftereffect that was being attempted.There are also more plot holes than a fishing net and the inconsistencies will finally have you wanting it over.Go watch the Exorcist instead.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ShadowsBeneathTheLight","23 January 2024","Idk why people give this movie such high scores. There are zero scares in this movie. Instead it is just a drawn out story about a priest confronting his demons, both literal and metaphorical. Personally I found this movie very boring. The opening scene is good, albeit not scary, but it just goes downhill from there. It seemed like it written by either 3 different people or maybe AI as the movie is all over the place. You have a very cliche family where we first see the daughter has horrible teenage angst against her mom, only for that to never pop up again in the movie. You also have a side plot that explores the church possibly being evil and priests are corrupt like abusing minors only for that to get thrown out the window about 2/3rds in. Meanwhile our main character tries to confront his guilt of being in a war but never firing a shot, but then also his guilt of not treating some mentally disturbed who think they are possessed (but aren't because they are just crazy). It just seemed like the writers did not know what story they wanted to tell so they just through it all in and hoped for the best.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","kickendit69","8 April 2023","I'm a very astute movie fan. From horror to Marvel. I've seen them all. The characters have no depth. No time is spent on developing the characters so you really don't care what happens to them. The special effects are just bad man. I mean bad. The shaking bed, lights flickering, the possessed individuals, and the story itself, it's all bad. It looks so fake. I mean it is fake anyway but you're looking at a movie. It's suppose to make you believe that it could be possible. I actually couldn't believe it!.... I couldn't believe that Russell Crowe, the academy award winning Gladiator man himself took part in this garbage. He must be low on moolah or something. The Exorcist, the original, is still number one till this day. You could even go with a good werewolf movie such as The Howling, only the first one of course, or The American Werewolf In London. All of my recommendations are a little old but they haven't made anything close to those movies yet. I could go in depth and explain why but I'll save that for another time. If you haven't seen this movie yet go ahead, watch it, but you've been warned.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","radhrh","12 June 2023","I learned a lot from The Pope's exorcist. For example that Rome is in Italy ( although I suspect they really mean The Vatican ) and that the best way to travel from The Vatican to Leon is by a vintage Vespa. I also learned how low a nortoriously ""difficult"" washed up Hollywood has been will stoop to pay his tax bill. To be fair this no star affair isn't all that bad, the production values are respectable and the special effects aren't embarrassing but the script is bargain bin at Pound Land caliber. All the usual tropes are here, spooky old house, recently widowed mother, petulant teenage daughter, traumatized young son, an unspeakable ancient evil buried deap below the castle, a whisky quaffing priest and another whoes faith is questioned. It's all by the numbers with zero surprises to offer.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","almagrimoira","11 August 2023","Every iconic scene, every element and character trait from the 1973 movie are ported and then exaggerated and blown out of proportions. Even Father Mirren's lovable quip ""Thank god my will is weak"" when he was offered brandy in the cold weather is transformed into a full-blown drunkard Father Amorth.The result is an unexpected caricature rendition of The Exorcist with overuse of all the common exorcism tropes, and profoundly weak writing, especially in everything related to the Pope character.It's a shame because the setup looked promising, with the Vatican intrigue and the abnormal Amorth character. But all that goes down hill so quickly.I think the makers weren't really going for a parody or a spoof. But cardboard characters, shallow plot and complete absence of any personality conflicts or philosophical themes made it what it is now.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","docdra","18 August 2023","Despite the title of my review, I don't think this was that great...or good.25 minutes in and I was wondering why I was still watching:1) Typical setup with the single mother raising two children after her spouse dies2) The older daughter is the typical sluttish rebellious teen that's angry at everything3) The younger son, the subject of the movie, is the quiet traumatized child4) They move into a dilapidated abbey/diocese that was left by the dead spouse - they're having it renovatedI could keep going, but already the tropes are stacking up, and so is the nonsense. In that first 25 minutes, the mother is walking around this castle-like building barefoot in her underwear, despite the fact that the building is under renovation, thus dirty and possibly dangerous. This is just the minor dumb stuff though.The pacing is so off, that again, in that first 25 minutes we're rushed into the younger child's possession, subsequent hospital visit with an MRI, spinal tap, and other nonsense before they send him home after labeling him a possible psychotic...all in one day apparently.Another issue - the film isn't horror. In fact, it doesn't know what it wants to be. There are splashes of comedy throughout the movie, as if they weren't sure if they should take the subject matter seriously or not. The comedy was detrimental to the overall seriousness of the subject matter itself, making you doubt what you were supposed to be feeling, thus the point of the entire movie. Ironically, however, or not, the humor makes this mediocre film a bit more palatable, as it distracts you from the nonsense otherwise taking place.If they had gone with a strictly serious tone, but better writing, or leaned more into the humor, then this could have been better. As it is, it just seems like they didn't know what they wanted to do - almost if they were setting this up for a franchise run. Where, instead of a typical action movie, they were shooting for a religious themed movie with cheap thrills - like exploding bodies...","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","derek-e-coster","18 August 2023","I like Russell Crowe. He always looks his age unlike someone like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise and thought this looked promising although I'm not really a horror film fan. I'm not even that keen on The Exorcist to which all possession are compared to and rightly so.However, after a fairly promising start things go downhill very fast. Some pointless Vatican politics and a family that are used to build the exorcism and which could have been done so much better.Then a load of over the top special effects and an old hidden history of some exorcism hundreds of years ago and there you have it.Russell Crowe can and has done so much better.

"The Pope's Exorcist","Tweetienator","2 May 2023","I wasn't too disappointed that's the good news, but I wasn't much impressed either - The Pope's Exorcist got some production value and a solid working cast (the boy of course is no match for Linda Blair but she was and is one of the best acted possessed lost soul ever) but what the movie mostly lacks is timing and the feel for real horror - The Exorcist or the first Conjuring movie (and there are some other far stronger possession/exorcism movies around) just play in another league in that aspect. I never had a feeling of being afraid, had no goosebumps, no jump scare hit me - here fails the director to deliver, which of course is a great faux pas. The level on the horror-o-meter is just too tame: one of the reasons may be that the movie uses every clich√© imaginable of this kind of movies, especially the horror scenes are, well, nothing really new or too interesting. Also the talking of the devil is, most of the time, stupid and rather lame. I hope, for the sake of the script writer, that the King of the Damned will not seek revenge for that blasphemy ;) What else? Production is pro, settings nice, cast solid. Verdict: watchable, but no must-watch for the lover of the art of horror - something that will please a mainstream audience maybe more, I guess.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","trinaboice","31 October 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
The dark, religious drama was directed by Julius Avery, leading the team of screenwriters: Michael Petroni, Evan Spiliotopoulos, R. Dean McCreary, and Chester Hastings. The movie is loosely based on the life of Gabrielle Amorth, an Italian priest who was an exorcist of the Diocese of Rome. The story is based on files of the Catholic priest that revealed a secret the Vatican was trying to keep hidden.I've always found movies like this to be super creepy because I DO believe in the devil. Do you? Comment below!When I was a little girl, I remember hearing people talk about the movie The Exorcist but it wasn't something my parents would ever want to take me to, plus the thought of it scared me. I still have never seen it! Some are calling this movie The Da Vinci Code meets The Exorcist.THINGS I LIKED:
Russell Crowe is great in this role. I love that he's trying out his talents in different genres. We even get to hear him speak Italian, as well as English with an Italian accent. Despite the dark theme, he brings welcome humor to his character and the film. It was his idea to have Father Amorth ride a Vespa. Ha ha I got to ride a Vespa in Tuscany, Italy. I felt like such a local. üòä
The legendary Italian actor, Franco Nero, plays the Pope, although he's not in many scenes.The rest of the cast did a good job and includes Alex Essoe, Laurel Marsden, Ryan O'Grady, Cornell John, and more.I don't usually like horror movies and wouldn't have seen this movie except I like Russell Crowe and was curious about his role. This is the first time he's ever starred in a horror flick.We get to visit Italy and Spain! I lived in Spain twice back in the 1980s. I left a piece of my heart there.I thought the special effects were pretty good.If you enjoy this, you'll be happy to know that the ending allows for sequels to continue the story. In a weird way, I like watching Russell Crowe kick demon butt.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I always worry about young children in horror movies and how the roles might emotionally harm them. Young Peter DeSouza-Feighoney did an excellent job. One thing I don't like is watching young kids swear.Some viewers have said they don't think this movie is scary. I did but that's probably because I'm not used to watching horror movies and don't enjoy being scared.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is not appropriate for children's viewing.Some profanity, including F-bombs spoken by a young boy
Italian and Spanish are spoken with subtitles
We see two boys possessed by devils.A priest drinks alcohol.We see blood, gore, and skeletons.!","10/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","AfricanBro","10 May 2023","I watched this last night and didn't hate it at the time, but after sleeping on it I realized this wasn't great at all. This should've been way more scary than it actually was, of which it wasn't. People used to be scared to watch horrors and that was the best part. This felt like it wasn't even trying, it's riddled with cliches. The aura wasn't even eerie, they just filmed in the dark I guess pray it has the desired effect. Didn't even have cheap scares. On that note however, it does seem like production budget was slim, so the makeup was great considering.The performances of the children aren't always convincing, that coupled with the dialogue that felt out of sorts, it had one liners that were intended to be scary but sound like they were written by a child. They were too on the nose and sometimes illogical. If your son throws a priest across the room I don't think you'd be surprised the church showing up. The characters were so unbelievable and flimsy.The story isn't anything new to the genre, added a few things in the side plots but otherwise still follows the same formula in the end. The backstory was a nice touch though. And Russell Crowe's performance elevated this to just about mediocre. I loved seeing the priest on the Ferrari Vespa, I don't know why but I was waiting for mattia binotto to show up.The last half hour isn't great, just waiting to wind down the clock. There wasn't a lot of places the story could go so it was pretty predictable. Russell Crowe was great in this and that's the only redeeming and inviting factor for most, but even that doesn't save the movie for me especially as a horror.","4/10"

The film is based on the life and stories of the Italian priest Gabrielle Amorth, exorcist of the diocese of Rome.Father Gabriel Amorth (Russell Crowe), head of exorcism at the Vatican, is confronted with his own past and the secret past of the Vatican during an investigation into the occupying Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney).In order to save Henry from the demon that has taken over him, deal with his own demons from his past with father Amorth and further uncover the hidden secrets of the Vatican.This is the first horror film in which Russell Crowe plays a part and has also dealt with ideas at the front of the film. Although this is Russell Crowe's first horror film, the film itself is a standard horror exorcism film. For connoisseurs of such films, the film itself can quickly come across as familiar or obvious.The film is also filled with horror clich√©s, where stupid characters will jump at any strange sound and then simply ask: Hello, is anyone there? Because of such clich√©s, the film itself is no longer really scary or exciting.Russell Crowe also comes across as a standard priest for his first horror film, trying to exorcise evil demons. He only often uses jokes and comic remarks, which can seem a bit contradictory in the front of a horror film. The other characters also play more standard horror movie characters, who, thanks to their many clich√© mistakes, remain difficult to take seriously or to really care about as a viewer. For Peter DeSouza-Feighoney, this is only his first acting role in a film. Despite the fact that his possessed characters come across as a bit of a stereotype, he knows how to come across physically believable as a possessed person.The horror makeup looks good and believable in the movie. Later on, when they start using less believable visual effects, the movie effects lose all their credibility and come across as a bit weak.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Wikkid_Gamez","19 August 2023","Like others have said, most exorcism movies are basically the same and are a dime a dozen.... This one was much better than expected, I'm sorry I put off watching it for so long! I had stashed it in my rainy day movies as something to watch when I couldn't find anything else I thought would be better. As most movies like this don't do much for me as they are too predictable and similar. The only reason I even added this to my list was because of Russell Crowe, I knew if he was in it then it had to be at least watchable. Well, I finally got around to it, and found it completely engaging! The history mixed in making the story much deeper than usual. Add to that the excellent acting and visual with the overall atmosphere the movie held and I would easily recommend this movie to others as well as watch it more than one in a decade myself, which is unusual for me, I don't watch most movies in the horror genre more than once every 10-15 years as I like not knowing what will happen because lets face it, most horror movies don't have much substance. I still love them, but they don't usually hold my attention beyond that first watch. Well, this one actually had more substance and I will definitely be watching it again, probably add it to our list of movies to watch around Halloween! A truly engaging and enjoyable experience! I actually kinda hope they decide to make a follow up sequel, that said I am probably asking for trouble even saying that as most sequels are beyond disappointing... But here's to hoping!","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","neolier-1","14 April 2023","How did heck did they get Russell Crowe to star in this movie? Beyond my understanding. Poorly written, terrible acting, and judging by the ending, a lame attempt to start a franchise?This is more a (bad) fantasy flick rather than a horror movie. Flat plot combined with average special effects that don't help to create impact on the viewer, who far from feeling tension or scared feels more bored than anything else.If you like horror movies like The Witch, The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Midsommar, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, etc., the stay away from this movie and avoid the disappointment.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","dadbodmedicnate","27 August 2023","Movie was pretty good. I enjoyed it overall.There were some parts that were a bit odd and unlikely. There was a couple moments that seemed cheesy.Overall I thought the actors did well and it told a good story. Definitely some good visuals and decent character building.I like most of what I have seen of Russel Crowe with this movie being no different. I thought he did a pretty decent job with his Italian accent and his jests towards the other languages. Seemed realistic enough to make the movie.They definitely left an open ending for sequels to this movie. I haven't checked to see if they are making a sequel yet but I do hope so. I would like to see more of this story.","10/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","stormfront-97408","15 May 2023","Based on the events of Father Gabrielle Amorth, the story was very well done. Russell Crowe, one of the finest actors is incredible in the role. If your looking for Hollywood horror gore this isn't the movie. This carries more suspense then horror gore but more focused on the story and great acting. The lines , script were given great detail and delivery. Nothing campy about this movie but well worth it. Now hopefully there were be sequels as fans of the movie would most likely want to know more about Father Amorth and the challenges he faced. As for the set designed, was perfect they put a lot of effort into this movie and it paid off.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","whitetowel-74786","12 May 2023","Ah yes, dear old (portly) Russell Crowe is back in Rome folks, only this time he's taking on the devil as... you guessed it... the Pope's Exorcist!Pleased to say the Crowe-man is back on top form here, drinking espressos, telling corny jokes and riding around on his vespa scooter in full priests garb with his trusty bag of anti-christ tricks strapped to the back.After a decent start sets the tone, at the behest of his boss back at Vatican HQ - the Pope, Crowe heads to a creepy rundown Spanish castle where a young boy has been possessed by a particularly evil entity, and so the plot thickens as the blood, thunder and numerous nods to Friedkin's benchmark 1973 flick The Exorcist ensue.The main plot (involving Vatican cover-ups) and many sub-plots just about manage to hold your attention, but the film starts to plod in places with too much downtime talk and unecessary backstory between the two exorcising priests (shout out to Daniel Zovatto as Russell's reluctant sidekick), which somewhat interrupts the focus and flow... as do The numerous subtitles due to different languages being used.Then in the final third things get pretty whacky, while the finale itself straddles the fine line between exciting and ott parody.Aside from a top performance from Russell Crowe (and indeed the entire supporting cast), the feel, lighting, cinematography, music and effects are all worthy of praise. However the overall screenplay is just not solid enough to sing it to the heavens.Based on the true stories of long serving lead Vatican Exorcist Father Gabriel Amorth, the film sets itself up for a sequel or two, so assuming it's a big enough hit, we could be seeing a hero rise from Rome once again... well, why the hell not....","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","kuner-59029","13 May 2023","This film isn't shy about what it's trying to be. A modern Exorcist, a classic that does everything the Exorcist did, but bigger, badder, with a message, some history etc.They have an older and a younger priest like in The Exorcist, they set up a token tragic backstory for Russel Crowe's character, they set up a tragic backstory for the possessed kid and some stuff about the church burying (literally) secrets of the Spanish Inquisition.It's supposed to be meaningful, but it's painting by the numbers, and none of it amounts to anything other than actors making silly faces and screaming a lot, as is customary in these possession movies.If that's your thing or you really love demon or religious horror films, then this may be for you. Russel Crowe is reliably good, though his Italian accent never really works. The actors of the family are all good and Franco Nero is still alive and still great even if it's just a cameo role.You could do a lot worse than this when it comes to horror films. 4/10 is probably lower than it deserves, but with Russel Crowe and Franco Nero attached, I expected something smarter, but substantive than 2 hours of screaming.I will say it's neither woke and anti-Christian, nor is it pro-Christian propaganda nike Nefarious. It tries to be as neutral as possible with its subject matter, similar to the original Exorcist, although that film gave us a much better dynamic between the exorcists and didn't try to shove in some pseudo-historic mystery aspect. That really ruins the film, since it makes the narrative plot driven instead of character driven like the classic.I was thoroughly bored.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","holmesliam-24015","15 April 2023","I absolutely love a possession/exorcism movie. I was really looking forward to this after the first time I saw the trailer, but after going to see it yesterday I have to say I was disappointed. The lack of real jump scares really takes down my score for this film I did not jump once we don't even get the cheap kill scare of a bird flying up. The family in the film I had no sympathy for what so ever I think we need more back story to them and also more back story for ""the dead girl""One positive for this film is Russell Crowe, I think he does a good performance and makes the character of Father Gabriele Amorth very likeable and they get a few funny moments in there but overall I was disappointed 4/10.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Leofwine_draca","21 December 2023","Well, I'd previously heard good things about THE POPE'S EXORCIST. How it was different from the glut of cheesy, sub-standard possession movies we've had our fill of in the last couple of decades. How an actor of Crowe's gravitas gives it an extra veneer of quality, and how it has far more depth than you'd expect for a horror film. Did I just watch a different movie? None of that turns out to be true. This is simply another cheesy, generic and predictable possession flick full of the usual gooey FX and OTT demonic voices that have been filling our screens ever since THE EXORCIST came out. The worst thing about it is the direction, from the guy who did the decent OVERLORD no less, which is so camp as to be ridiculous.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","paul_haakonsen","4 May 2023","Well, I have to say that director Julius Avery's 2023 movie ""The Pope's Exorcist"" wasn't too shabby for an exorcism movie. I had initially thought that it was going to be just another run-of-the-mill attempt at making an exorcism movie, so I hadn't cranked up my hopes for the movie.But with it being a horror movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I found the time to sit down and watch it. And I have to say that I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the 103 minutes that the movie ran for. And on that account, then I can warmly recommend you to sit down and watch ""The Pope's Exorcist"", especially if you enjoy exorcism movies.The storyline in the movie was good, though it was a fairly straight forward demonic possession and exorcism story, if you look at it objectively. But there were some nice twists to the narrative along the way. I definitely enjoyed what writers Michael Petroni, Evan Spiliotopoulos, R. Dean McCreary, Chester Hastings and Jeff Katz managed to put together based on the works Gabriele Amorth's books.Leading actor Russell Crowe was actually quite nicely cast for the role of Father Gabriel Amorth and carried the movie nicely with his performance. And young actor Peter DeSouza-Feighoney was outstanding as the demonically possessed Henry.Something that really worked well in favor of the movie, was the atmosphere that director Julius Avery managed to pull off, and the intensity of the possession and the powers of the demonic entity. That really added a lot of layers to the movie.Visually then the movie had quite good special effects.""The Pope's Exorcist"" is a very enjoyable exorcism film, and it is one that I definitely recommend.My rating of ""The Pope's Exorcist"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","arisaig-90642","10 April 2023","They should have hired a Catholic to review the script because it was preposterous. Everyone knows the basics of exorcism - GO TO CONFESSION FIRST, for one thing. Gabriele Amorth would be rolling over in his grave knowing this is the film made of his life. They didn't even get the words of absolution correct. A dull story built on cliche (do we really need to hear about the Spanish Inquisition again?). Definitely one of the worst films I've seen in recent history. Exploding naked women covered in blood. I mean, really? And the demon is trapped for centuries but then travels from one person to another by mouth - gee, sound like COVID anyone? Really, really awful.","1/10"

Demon who can use telekinesis and psychic powers can't even get out of a rope?

"The Pope's Exorcist","martin-lynch-713-581715","5 May 2023","Russell Crowe saves the day (and the movie) it is predictable, not a great deal of expense for special effects or sets. The movie is based on the files of Gabriele Amorth (the actual Chief Exorcist for the Vatican).From the beginning you kind of know how it ends. The special effects are ""simple"" and for the most part, cheap. Both Crowe and Daniel Zovatto do have presence on screen, the family...... meh, they are there..It would have been nice to see Franco Nero (the Pope) and Cornell John (Bishop Lumumba) have more screen time as both are brilliant Actors and worth watching. I would say that would have made for a more interesting experience.The ending seems to leave it open for a sequel or series of follow-ups (still waiting for Crowe to return as Robin Hood.... hint, hint!)Not a movie the will rock your world, don't rush home to watch it... more of a case "" if it's on and your home then play it""","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","kevin_robbins","13 July 2023","The Pope's Exorcist (2023) is a movie that I recently watched on a flight. The storyline follows Gabriele Amorth, who was an Italian priest in real life and reported directly to the Pope. He was an expert on demons and was only given special assignments by the Vatican. We follow a special case he is given that unlocks secrets that have been inside the Vatican for centuries. As he works this case he begins meeting the people that will one day help him put together the Association of Exorcists, which was/is also a real group within the Vatican.This movie is directed by Julius Avery (Overlord) and stars Russell Crowe (Gladiator), Daniel Zovatto (Don't Breath), Alex Essoe (Midnight Mass), Franco Nero (Django) and Peter DeSouza-Feighoney (The Girl with the Metal Heart).I actually liked aspects of this more than I thought I would. Russell Crowe was actually pretty good in this. His mannerisms and dialogue were entertaining and he looked the part. Zovatto delivers a solid supporting performance and Peter DeSouza-Feighoney delivers a great child performance. The exorcism scenes are very good and the makeup and effects during those sequences were top notch...we just needed more of them. The storyline was interesting, primarily because it was based on a true story, and the settings and backdrops were perfectly selected. The ending relied a bit too much on CGI but was still entertaining and rewarding in its own way. It definitely set up well for a sequel.Overall, this isn't the Conjuring by any means, but it is worth a watch for fans of exorcism films. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend watching it once.","8/10"

Much more action than I expected.It is corny in places, including the main premises of the story, some of the dialogue is a little recycled, but on the whole a thoroughly enjoyable movie, one which, years ago when Crowe was a bigger star, would have got a lot more press and attention than it has.","9/10"

I laughed out loud.I'm not Catholic but am Christian. I do believe in demons and possession but can't see how praying to dead people (Mary the physical mother of Jesus Christ) could possibly do anything.

"The Pope's Exorcist","frank-liesenborgs","16 April 2023","""The Pope's Exorcist"" may not be considered as the best exorcism movie of all time, but it certainly stands out from the rest that have tried to explore this intriguing subject in recent years. This film claims to be ""inspired by Vatican files,"" and although the degree of factual accuracy may be up for debate, it delivers a gripping and engaging possession story that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The true highlight of this film is undoubtedly the performance of Russell Crowe, who delivers a powerful and nuanced portrayal of his character. Crowe's charisma and sense of humor bring an added dimension to the movie, making his character both likeable and believable. It's refreshing to see such a talented actor take on an unconventional role like this one, and he does not disappoint. The story itself is a breath of fresh air from the run-of-the-mill exorcism movies that have flooded the market in recent years. The dialogues are well-written and natural, delivered with a nice dose of humor. The soundtrack is fitting, and the cinematography and locations are a feast for the eyes. The practical effects and gore add a touch of old-school horror, which is always welcome. Sure, the digital special effects may not be perfect in a few scenes, but this does not detract from the overall quality of the film. ""The Pope's Exorcist"" manages to keep viewers thoroughly entertained throughout its runtime, and that's what matters most. If you are looking for something different, then this film is worth checking out. Two thumbs up for this one!","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","benjaminskylerhill","14 April 2023","We live in a world where there have been thousands of demon possession horror films, and most of them suck. Nearly every one of them has taken elements from the few good ones and butchered them in execution.Tropes abound in these films, and they almost never have anything interesting to say and never do a single original nor compelling thing throughout their entire runtimes.This is not one of those movies, thankfully.Granted, it does make use of tropes and all of the more action-heavy scenes are full of cliches and visual ""tricks"" that got old about 30 years ago.But The Pope's Exorcist's screenplay is significantly more interesting than I expected it to be. It fleshes out the two main priest characters as human beings and plays with the relationship between guilt and personal faith to shockingly effective results.I became invested in these characters' success because I wanted them to overcome their pasts. This rarely happens to me when I watch movies like this.I was also impressed with Julius Avery's direction. He uses some very clever tricks with the camera to place the characters' emotional stare at the center of the action so the film never becomes tiresome to look at and certainly never gets boring.That's not to say that the film is great or revolutionary, though. Although Russell Crowe's performance helps keep the movie afloat, the story doesn't do anything new and the climax plays out in the exact same overly dramatised, melodramatic way that all of these possession movies play out.It builds up some intriguing concepts, but it didn't stick the landing with them in a way that would've been memorable.","10/10"

Not Marvel stupid corny jokes, but a real witty humor. For me personally this was one of the major driving forces of the picture. You don't generally see that people laugh several times during a horror movie.Sense of humor, charm and charisma will go along way, when you're tasked with playing a priest exorcist. It's not what people would expect, and it's perfect.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","masonfisk","16 September 2023","An out & out further theft of 1973's The Exorcist comes in this recent release starring Oscar winner Russell Crowe. Crowe is the Vatican's head exorcist sent out when things get really bad which happens when a single mother, Alex Essoe (from Doctor Sleep) & her kids, Carrie Munro & Peter DeSouza-Feighoney, descend upon an old property they've bought which turns out to be the hub of demonic activity. DeSouza-Feighoney gets his Linda Blair on as he's possessed going down the checklist (body contortions, profanity laced tirades to onlookers, facial scars, etc.) before Crowe shows up abetted by a local priest, Daniel Zovatto, who get the assignment of their lives while the Pope back in his papal surroundings, Franco Nero, sits back & awaits the outcome. Slavish to its theft of the original granddaddy of possession pictures, one wonders if even the filmmakers were bored on set making this thing because I sure was while watching it which feels so passed its sell by date, you'd be surprised the finished product wasn't unearthed in an Egyptian tomb.","8/10"

Russell Crowe is quite the actor, watching him copy the behaviors and mannerism of exorcists and men of the church was kinda interesting to entangle that into his character role, gotta appreciate the lengths these actors go to to achieve that persona and make the audience believe. All in all, I'd say this is a decent movie, probably worth an Oscar or 2, maybe an Emmy, but was this movie ""The Best Worldwide"" I wouldn't say so, I just enjoy the movie for what it is.","10/10"

Pretty much Church and religion is weak against evil and at the end somehow someone who didn't use to believe, would make the come back and save the day...NOT THIS TIME!! Finally (and I challenge EVERYONE out there to prove me wrong), the priest won the daemon with his faith and broke the tradition, thank you!!!No matter if someone believes or not in any religion, this was starting to become boring and very repeating, so this movie was a pleasant surprise after 30 years of the same scenario.I really hope that they will produce many more films based on this one afterwards.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Meaningless_Signifier","19 August 2023","Russell Crowe carries much of the weight with his performance (I'm not a good judge of accents, so I can't comment on that aspect).The film seems well budgeted, and many of the purely technical aspects are fairly good, but the writing is mostly by-the-numbers, an adequate but rather bland facsimile. It tries to pack in so much, but most of the material lacks anticipation or tension, while many of the possession scenes border on outright comedy.It's hard to do something truly original. The real problem isn't imitation itself, but rather imitation which fails to truly elevate, enhance or stand out.","2/10"

Spoooky.I enjoyed seeing Gab ride around on his Vesper and the humor was decent.I don't know how directors/writers get away with this crap, and how companies even approve this trash. Like do they not watch it before releasing?? Unless you have literally never seen a horror or your extent of horror is equivalent of like the ghostbusters, I don't see how anyone can see the thrill or fear in this.

"The Pope's Exorcist","aylinpatacsil","3 May 2023","As someone who played the RPG video game DA: Inquisition, I immediately recognized the symbol. I did a search on The Spanish Inquisition and its symbols/icons/seals/emblems thinking that the Game Designers might have taken inspiration from an original, medieval symbol, but nothing close came up. But the 'seal' the film uses is the EXACT COPY of Dragon Age: Inquisition's. It's likely a production staff just googled 'Inquisition Seal', and the Dragon Age T-shirts and stickers came up, so they just used it carelessly, with no one on set having ever played the game to realize the plagiarism. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm predicting a copyright strike.Anyway, I didn't like the film. Bad exposition. Too predictable. Bad demon big villain voice. Too many tropes. Too many CGI tropes even.

"The Pope's Exorcist","chrsstout","23 August 2023","I like watching Russell Crowe as an exorcist priest. It pretty much had that going for it. I didn't like the kid. If child actors bother you, then this one will drive you crazy. I mean he did well, poor kid acted his heart out. But man...I couldn't wait for him to stop talking. Which is another area where this movie kind of lacked. The dialogue is pretty not-so-good. It was like when you finish writing an essay, but you haven't met the minimum word count requirement, so you go back and make sentences long and unnecessary. The dialogue was like that. And the scary exorcist parts...were pretty redundant and contrived. Force-choke here, spider-climb up a wall there. Really just going down the list for an exorcist movie and checking the boxes. There were several times I could have sworn that I was watching a movie written by AI.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ninjafoofighter","29 May 2023","Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor , I enjoy his movies but this one was really a waste of time for him and viewers. Bits and pieces in the first half were ok but went completely off the rails in the second half. Got so bored with the nonsense that I skipped ahead towards the end. Felt like it was at least half an hour too long. This is a movie I would not watch again. I gave it a 4 only because of Crowe otherwise it would be a 2. Russell Crowe was the only good part of this movie but I am truly puzzled by why he did it. What a waste of money and effort by all involved. Just another B grade movie. Why Russell why?","10/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","mge1108","3 July 2023","There is nothing original here. Russell Crowe is ridiculous, his performance plagued mainly by that absurd, growling, faux-Italian accent. The possessed kid growls and contorts. And then actual Satan shows up or something and more growling and contortion ensues. Seriously. I can think of a million worse things a demon could do to a possessed person.This is honestly just a copy of The Exorcist with minor tweaks. And over-the-top (in a bad way) special effects.Don't worry: there's a random Iron Maiden. Because it takes place in Spain. And they had the Inquisition. And Catholicism.Can we please get a growl- and contortion-free exorcism film? I know there have to be writers, filmmakers, and producers out there up to this really basic, unchallenging task.","4/10"

Oh my, that fake Italian accent grates the ears, Crowe is fast becoming the Australian Steven Seagal...Any positives? The moody soundtrack is okay, the special effects are passable (even though you could tell they're all digital and no practical), the setting in Spain is beautiful.

"The Pope's Exorcist","austenyoung-233-322573","2 June 2023","Russel Crow told his friends he could do great accents and his mate said 'imagine a film where a kid talks with a deep voice and swears' and the Pope's exorcist was created. It's not funny but it's not not funny either. Fat people riding on undersized scooters that are later used for towing is always a hoot and a kid miming swears to adults is shocking for about 30 seconds and then it's just filler until the end where the movie has an identity crisis and won't commit to being a horror and film and decides it's a campy comedy. Point is that this film is the drizzling sh!ts. Not sure who it's audience is and I don't think it knows who it was going for. As for the plot - a kid gets possessed and needs an exorcist. They look for one, find one and hilarity ensues.","4/10"

The rest was just yawn worthy done to death exorcism tripe... demon jumping into priest, priest winning family goes off to live happily ever after.

"The Pope's Exorcist","dasa108","26 April 2023","Obviously this film has nothing to do with the life and work of the famous exorcist Gabrielle Amorth who becomes grotesquely involved in an implausible situation that does little justice to his religious career. The film as such entertains despite its lack of historical consistency; and that must be thanks to the fact that all the guidelines of a film that meets expectations are followed: good photography, good set design, suitable locations, correct performances and solvent direction. The problem lies in its lack of originality, but even this defect has its advantage; at least it doesn't disappoint connoisseurs.It's a much nicer film than the also shot in Ireland Evil Dead Rise.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","lee-96696","23 August 2023","This film is a strictly paint-by-the-numbers exorcism film, so I will not waste much time on the plot. The only highlight: Russel Crowe.It is set in 1987, in Castile, Spain. The basics: an American widow and her two kids -- a negative, bratty teenage girl, and a young boy maybe age eight -- come to an old monastery her recently deceased husband had left her. She's having it renovated with the intention of selling it for a big profit so that her family has some income. Strange things start to happen, and, you guessed it, full on possession of the little boy. (Too bad it is not the I-hate-everything girl).Who do you call? Yes, Father Amorth (Russel Crowe), the master exorcist and friend of the Pope. He teams up with a local priest, a young and somewhat teen-idol-looking Father Esquibel. I will let the reader guess the progression of the story. There are political shenanigans at the Vatican, research and manuscripts at the Vatican archives (Trinity College's Library in Dublin fills in here -- it has been used for Harry Potter films) and some routine exorcism special effects. You are quickly delivered -- it is paced like a television show -- to a fairly predictable outcome albeit with some twists and reveals and one or two unexplained matters, specifically the motivations of a very young Cardinal from America. He reminded me of the Jude Law character in The Young Pope an old HBO series.So it's a mildly diverting, not very challenging hour and a half. Good for a stressed out weeknight. But what makes this movie stand out is Russel Crowe's performance. He takes what the writers have given him and turned it into a likable, engaging character. This exorcist has a sense of humor melded with understandable world weariness. I may need to watch, re-watch some other Russel Crowe films.If I were a betting person, I'd say this movie is a set up for a series or sequel. There is the ""cop buddy"" vibe of Amorth and Esquibel. The loose ends at the Vatican just scream to be explained in greater detail. I for one, see trouble brewing with the American cardinal.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","sacha_brady","7 July 2023","It's not boring but...If it's any kind of entertainment, it's in spite of itself.It's miscast, has a contrived plot, hackneyed direction, is badly scripted, poorly scored, and cheap-looking when it mattered most.It comes across like an 80s made-for-video horror film of the kind that has no charm.It's hard to fathom what Russel Crowe was doing anywhere near this. His quality was not on show anywhere here and the sound mix made him often hard to understand anyway. The funniest moment actually comes at the end when it's clear what the producers had in mind / held out a forlorn hope for.If you like films on this subject, are not turned off by anything Dan Brown-ish and don't expect much, this film will happily kill 90 minutes or so for you.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","BJG-Reviews","7 May 2023","The stage curtains open ...Father Esquibel: ""Let's go to work.""
Father Amorth: ""Let's go to Hell.""""The Pope's Exorcist"" (2023) starring Russell Crowe and Daniel Zovatto is a loosely based film on the true life story of Father Gabriele Amorth, who was a Catholic Priest and an Exorcist for the Diocese of Rome which is under the direct jurisdiction of the Pope - hence, the title of the movie. I really didn't know what to expect coming in, other than your usual exorcist-type stuff (prayers in chaotic situations from priests standing over a restrained possessed individual tied to a bed). We certainly got that ... and a whole lot more.Father Gabriele Amorth (Crowe) is being questioned about his methods as an exorcist, one who is perceived as being a bit of a rogue and independent, taking matters into his own hands without receiving the required approvals needed first. But, when a little boy is possessed by a rather strong demon in an abbey in Spain, he is assigned firsthand by the Pope himself to go and investigate, as this particular location has been a sore spot for the church in the past. Expecting this to be the 'usual' situation, Father Amorth finds that this may be the biggest challenge he's ever faced, maybe even at the cost of his own life. This is no small deal ... this is something that could destroy everything he knows and bring the church to its knees. All they need is the demon's name ... without it, they are doomed.Curious, I did a little research on the actual priest that this movie was based on, and coincidentally enough, he has been described as the ""James Bond of exorcists"". I say that is coicidental because, after the movie ended, that is EXACTLY what I was thinking. ""I'm Amorth. Gabriele Amorth. I am Double O - 666. License to exorcise."" I was thinking to myself that if James Bond were an exorcist, this is how he'd be. There is very little to none with the scare factor here. It is heavy on the intrigue, the investigation that leads us to a solemn secret, and tons of special effects and action. We get a lot of the usual cliche'd dialogue lines such as 'God works in mysterious ways', and the like. As well as a formidable demonic force to be defeated.This wasn't a bad movie, per se. If you are going in expecting a good, scary horror film ... this is not it. Some of the situations were even borderline laughable, but the cinematography was excellent, and Russell Crowe carries the film remarkably, as he often does. I wouldn't recommend it, but I feel it is worth a watch at a rating of 6 stars out of 10. ""The Pope's Exorcist"" will keep you engaged and interested. It won't scare you, but it will entertain you.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Skruffbagg","29 October 2023","The is the second exorcism themed movie I've watched in the last week and is, by far, the more entertaining one.I can't help but compare this to The Exorcist: Believer, which is pointless, tensionless and dull. This is a far better movie, but is essentially a fairly routine horror elevated by a hugely entertaining and engaging performance by Russell Crowe, who is clearly having a blast playing the Vatican's Chief Exorcist, Gabriele Amorth (a real person - look him up).In the film, a mother and her 2 children move from America to Spain to take possession of a spooky old abbey, bequeathed to them in her late husband's will after he is killed in a car accident that the youngest child Henry was in, rendering him traumatised and mute. Whilst exploring the ruins, Henry disturbs a creepy door behind a crumbling wall, is promotly possessed by a demon and requests a priest - but he only means one in particular. Enter scooter riding, secret boozing, bantering Father Amorth, to investigate and help the family.The set up is short and to the point, there's no time wasted in getting to what we all came for - exorcism fun times! Brevity is the soul of wit, after all.The exorcism, subsequent investigation into the abbey's sinister history, and build up to the finale is all pretty good, I can't really fault it. The plot is very basic and the cast are all ok, but Crowe chews the scenery and steals the show, making an otherwise standard scary film very watchable. It's not going to frighten anyone who watches supernatural horror regularly, but I've definitely seen worse this year and would give it a light recommendation.My one major criticism is the ridiculous and slightly hilarious sequel-bait in the last 5 minutes, which felt like they were trying to set up a 'Conjuring' style exorcist universe and made me chuckle. I turned to my partner in this moment and said ""The Pope's Exorcist 2: This Time It's Personal""Stick it on, you could do a lot worse.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","movie_mark_72","11 July 2023","I managed to sit through 25 mins of this laughable nonsense before kicking it into touch.It is so incredibly bad!!Russel Crowe sounds like a fast show character struggling to hold together a plot that plays out like a jumble of every exorcism / ghost movie ever made.The possessed kid is just pure comedy....and the demons voice would better suit a baddy in an episode of Scooby Doo.I might revisit the end tomorrow as I've paid 3 quid to hire it out, however I think it's quite unlikely.....Ok... So I came back today to watch the final hour or so and actually laughed out loud two or three times before falling asleep.This is a such pointless, big budget car crash.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","FixedYourEnding","26 May 2023","Father Gabriel Amorth (Russel Crowe) is the head Exorcist for the Vatican. Apparently that is something that exists and even a first-person book memoirs written about that. There is even a more documentary style movie featuring the read father Amorth (""The Devil and Father Amorth"" from 2017), however that one got a horrid review on IMDB, so I was satisfied with watching the trailer.Obviously the fictional version of ""The Pope's Excorcist"" is much more fun to watch than the real thing. Crowe looks nothing like the real Amorth but somehow with his demeanor, the white beard and the duality between him and the church, he becomes a true protagonist. His apprentice, Father Esquibel (played by Daniel Zovatto) is a great character of a young priest who made some missteps along the way, but in it by itself does not add much to this film.The kind of sums up what is good in this movie, maybe other than the first scene (featured on the trailer as well) which is smart, a little funny and surprising, but unfortunately this trend doesn't carry on to the rest of the movie, which instead, is unimaginative dribble to down-right boring. I don't know if it's just me, but seeing a 12 year-old curse at an older man is not scary to me, no matter how bad of a dental work the makeup team arranged for him.Other than the fact that you do end up caring for the main character, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" fails to create any further emotion for the rest of the characters, or any kind of fear for that matter, which as a horror film seems should have been a goal for the director. So, a horror film that is not scary and actually kind of laughable, I don't think this is was the director was shooting for. On top of that we see all the usual stuff that we see in exorcist movies, demons with robotic voice, objects flying, upside-down cross, reciting of the verses, it's all been there, seen that kind of stuff.The movie is rated 'R' but genuinely is not scarier than movies like ""Pray for the Devil"" (which is rated PG-13 and I also reviewed recently) and better in that respect. In other words, I was expecting a lot more under an 'R' rating. I would recommend if you want to watch Russel Crowe in a good role, but otherwise very skippable. Exact score: 53 / 100.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","lroyce-48163","1 September 2023","There were things I liked about this movie. Russell Crowe tooling about on his Vespa-like vehicle, toolbox of exorcism paraphernalia strapped to the side, on his way to fight demons. Crowe's character is based on an actual exorcist who died in 2016. Wonder what he would have thought of this
Crowe appears before The Anti-Exorcisms-Without-Permission-Board where a snot-nosed cardinal (bishop?) tries to take him down. Not happening! Crowe's character even leaves before the meeting is over! The audacity! We have never seen this before...well, maybe a few times
The little boy who winds up being possessed by Asmodeus is very good.This movie borrows a lot from previous exorcism movies:
Furniture flying through the air
People flying through the air
Writing on the boy's stomach...but wait! It's not the cold raised letters of The Exorcist! The letter are red. Completely different
Lots and lots of growling
It's okay...just okay.","6/10"

Yeah you heard it rightThe story is very engaging and VFX are very good as well, it's more on the realistic side rather than your typical horror movie with jump scares.

"The Pope's Exorcist","MartianTom","17 July 2023","Actually, you can leave the last two words off the title of this review, and the remainder will say enough. Huge ones!Ah... once again, I was conned by the 'above 6' rating on IMDb. All of those above 5 can really only have been given by reviewers for whom computer games or Marvel films give a satisfying level of dramatic engagement and plot complexity.To be fair, I've always rather liked Russell Crowe as an actor, feeling that he always brings a certain gravitas to his roles. He was certainly the best thing in this film - apart from The Cult's 'She Sells Sanctuary' on the soundtrack at the beginning. Sadly, though, even an actor of his quality couldn't save this abysmal mess - the product of a juvenile script and a director who thought that some whizz-bang CGI set pieces would make up for lack of plot, character development, and just about everything else. Every cliche you could expect was here - including the 'jump scares' which weren't 'jumpy' at all, given that we've seen them so many times before. Then the others, in predictable order: the possessed child, the slamming doors, the leaping cupboards, the bouncing beds. And why must demons always have that deep, guttural voice - part tenor, part wolf, part lion growling through a megaphone? How about an occasional castrato falsetto?On the subject of characters - there wasn't a single sympathetic one amongst the whole lot. I just wanted all of them to die, and horribly - perhaps with the exception of Crowe's. The performances - apart from moments with Crowe's, and perhaps the boy's - were uniformly terrible. Who cast this lot? Who scripted their words? Who gave the whole thing the green light in the first place? As a drama, it's laughable. As a comedy, it's unfunny. I don't think it really knows what it is. Nor does anyone involved in it.Give it a miss and watch the original 'The Exorcist' instead. Once you've seen that, you've seen all you need to - and you can leave rubbish like this to the kids.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","dissanctus","14 July 2023","I started out moderately intrigued, as Russel Crowe managed to convince me that his humorous gruff exorcist might be a worthy character to follow forwards. Everything soon fell apart into a shambling overblown mish-mash of every exorcism trope possible, and I quickly became bored of the family we didn't know or care about standing around while the usual cross-waving prayer shouting nonsense carried on. The young lad did a gutsy performance but the whole thing never presented any palpable sense of menace, believability or realism, in fact I felt like I was watching an unnecessarily long episode of Creepshow. By the end I was more interested in my toasted cheese sandwich than the screen, where characters were flying about in some completely nonsensical CGI comedy. In short, dreadful. It's convinced me more than ever that the whole possession theme is completely milked dry and has nothing new to offer. This was no ""The Exorcist"", not by a long shot, and even the vaguely Catholic moralising felt pointless, shallow, perfunctory. I wasted 7 bucks on this but I don't mind if it puts me off future gambles with anything similar.","10/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","elvisvkolaj","21 April 2023","I have been waiting for a movie like this.A smooth horror film, no need for jumpscares, a good scenario and a great character. In my opinion the scenario could have been expanded a little bit more and be more ""mysterious"" due to the nature of the investigation taking place in the movie, let along that Russel C. Is not starring everyday in such films so viewers could have watched more of it. Great character, nice antithesis with the nature of his purpose. Yes, it is the classic exorcist movie plot but you knew that before you watch the movie, as an answer to critics commenting ""the same old exorcist story"".Movie was really enjoyable.RC's acting wasn't not on point, based on his accent, but I cannot think of someone else that could have nailed the Italian accent and be an actor of this caliber.(Who Al Pacino ???)

"The Pope's Exorcist","jonny_","17 April 2023","The first two thirds of this movie were actually an interesting and refreshing treat, the acting from Russell Crowe and Daniel Zovatto is honestly excellent from start to finish.Russell Crowe in particular gives his best effort since American Gangster and it really shows. He's showing off a range of emotions, accents and a good sense of humour in a movie that could easily have been instantly forgettable.The real setback is the ending, it's actually still a little satisfying storywise but the tone shifts quite a bit and it doesn't fit in with what the rest of the movie set up. It moves from moody intrigue and mystery to the more generic visual gore/horror which was a bit of a let down. It doesn't ruin it, but it definitely doesn't give the payoff you hope for.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","dlc-52470","24 August 2023","Not!It was nothing but the same old predictable plot boring the heck out of me, for the only reasons I gave it a go was because it had Crowe.The scene of Crowe appearing scared as a top exorcist was ridiculous, wtf would he look üò® when the devil made him see something, knowing damn well that's what he tells others to look out for after he's seen it done 1000s of times before? Then he's scurrying out of the boy's room while grabbing his religious crap with his mouth opened üòØ in fear. Are you serious?! LolHow the mom was never nearby to make sure a priest, of all people, knew what he was doing to her seriously ill son, but instead remaining downstairs in that gigantic dusty mansion made no sense.The young priest couldnt act, and when he was hurled across and out of that large room by demon boy into that big armoire against the wall in their hallway, he should have at least ended up in a hospital or needing a walking cane for a few days.Why can't directors, writers, etc... make intelligent horrors like in the days of ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Omen"" or even ""Bad Seed""? GeeezUs!Women Directors are creating some great films thou.And just seeing Catholic Priests üëÄ in a movie is terrifying just by itself lol, where I'd enjoy it if it was about them getting their tongues cut out, hands chopped off and other limbs too by abused deceased kids that are now slowly possessing Nuns, now that would be a great horror, eh?I'm sure vegans didn't appreciate the beginning scene.

"The Pope's Exorcist","privatck","10 October 2023","Of course, the possessed boy in the movie listens to Metal right before being possessed. How else could you possibly satisfy religious prudery and outdated clich√©s at the same time? The movie is based on the memoirs written by a guy that thought yoga and Harry Potter were Satan's work.I'm really really tired of horror movies solving problems like so-called possessions and hauntings by the help of ""good old Catholic religion"". By claiming at least some of this was real (memoirs!), it glorifies exorcisms and therefore the refusal to get ""possessed"" people the help they actually need. The movie tries to overcome the church's old-fashioned image by making a somewhat cool and rebellious man main character. But this character's actually based on someone who really hurt and endangered people, reducing their suffering to a religious issue. I'd rather not glorify a man like this and impute him with heroic actions.","7/10"

It's so bad. It's so good! Wonderful hilarity.If you know that it's based on the ""true stories"" of a real life Catholic dude it makes it even better imagining the mundane reality that was embellished by this guy to make himself the hero of the story.The ending of the movie has the funniest text overlay. Not really a spoiler but be warned in case you're extra sensitive. Russell Crowe wrote books about his exorcisms. THE BOOKS ARE GOOD. Those last 4 words are exactly what is written on screen.

"The Pope's Exorcist","adamblackshaw-14445","19 April 2023","THE POPE'S EXORCIST is truly a silly film. Not at all scary apart from a few 'jump scares'. It makes THE DA VINCI CODE look like a masterpiece and isn't a patch on THE NAME OF THE ROSE or even the original THE EXORCIST. I make these comparisons bc I was really hoping for so much more. I like a good mystery amidst the pomp and glitter of the Catholic Church. But it really doesn't come close.The real exorcist, Father Gabriele Amorth, has been used to create this totally predictable and fictional hogwash. We've seen these characters before. The innocent family heading to doom is from THE SHINING, the Father Gabriele Amorth character is Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing and his priest offsider is any number of ineffective wet priests from any number of movies. The 'possessed child' is no Linda Blair.Only one thing elevates it above 2 stars and that's Russell Crowe. He does his best with this unfortunate material. He really does fill the screen in the same way G√©rard Depardieu can. At 59yo he's looking the worse for wear these days but hey, he's an exorcist so I assume he's seen some stuff.Don't waste your time and money on this dross. I was laughing through most of it.It looks like they are wanting to turn this into a franchise. The ending suggests they could make another 199 films! God help us!

Honestly am supposed to make a practical opinion of my review but now i guess I'll just use this medium to express my appreciation towards the making of this movie to help accelerate the awareness of such being's that they actually exist but the faith in God is absolutely above all and we should not forget to confess your sins cause in the eyes of the Lord we all are naked as like the day you were born.

"The Pope's Exorcist","sunznc","29 August 2023","The film is rushed. That's one of its largest faults. There is very little back story and what is even worse is the weak acting. Alex Essoe needs a lot more studying and coaching. I found myself thoroughly distanced from the film just by her inability to show any emotion.Very little time given to the story, very little depth or thought put into dialog. The only actor who got decent dialog was Russell Crowe and even then his character's sarcastic wit is misplaced here.The director didn't care about any of this or he would have let the mother act like a mother. The sister? A Hollywood cliche'.Very disappointing. Russel Crowe deserved better. I felt bad that he took this and put so much work into it. I'm sure when he saw the finished product he had to remind himself it was a paycheck.This really is a big piece of garbage. Terrible.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","DarkVulcan29","28 April 2023","I here this is based on a true story. But I know there are moments that are very much improvised, that's Hollywood for you. If you've seem a lot of exorcist films, then The Pope's Exorcist may feel like nothing new.Takes place in 1987 Father Gaberiele Amorth (Russell Crowe) is asked to perform an excorcism on a boy, but a mystery comes into play, has the demon knows him a little to well, and Amorth needs to know more about the demon in order to defeat m and save the boy, but the question is will he?The film is scary, but it never goes too over board. The film tries to focus on more a character study, and that is why you get such a memorable performance by Russell Crowe, a priest, whose past comes into play, of becoming his demons. All the rest of the cast are pretty good, but the boy is has equally has good has Crowe, he play it very scary has being possessed quite perfectly, almost steals the movie from Crowe.

Titular devil-battling priest Russell Crowe (looking the part but with a dodgy Italian accent) is the sent to a run-down Spanish abbey where American kid Peter DeSouza-Feighoney's been possessed by a demon that likes to snarl ""You're all going to die"" (sigh)... to the despair of mum Alex Essoe & sis Laurel Marssen (poor). With local vicar Daniel Zovatto, Crowe takes on the evil spirit whilst uncovering its origins and what it wants. This is tired fare from writers Michael Petroni & Evan Spiliototopolous and director Julius Avery.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","johnspringer-95440","12 June 2023","An uninspired rehash of every exorcism movie ever made. If you love exorcism movies you may enjoy this; otherwise you're likely to find it tedious and unoriginal. As usual a demon with a grandiose and convoluted plan to strike out at the RC Church possesses some kid who spends his days writhing around on a bed looking evil while making profane and threatening comments. You know from the outset where things are headed and the movie doesn't try anything particularly original. It's not frightening in the slightest; it doesn't even manage the disconcerting atmosphere of The Exorcist, a movie whose shocking elements are pretty dated and tame by current standards.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","wtfxxxgp","12 January 2024","What utter garbage this was. Sorry, I'm being so blunt, but it's the truth. It looks good, Russel Crowe was decent, and the audio effects (excluding the ""obligatory"" ""demon voice"" with the absolutely terrible sync issues), gave this a solid 2/10 stars.If you want a decent story though, it's not found here. That said, maybe if you're catholic you will enjoy it. I'm not, so I didn't. The entire thing was utterly forgettable and it really felt like it stole 3 hours of my life even though it was quite a short movie by today's terrible standards.So cliched. Nothing new to be seen. Hard to find anything worthwhile beyond the ""tech"" aspects of making movies. I'm sad, because the trailer hyped me up for this one.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","DamianNY","19 August 2023","To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Fr. Amorth had many supernatural experiences in his life, and they barely touched on his story at all. This could've been anyone's story, and I guess it was: I doubt this has any basis in anything to do with Fr. Amorth. What a missed opportunity.The dialogue was laughable, special effects eye-rolling, acting just plain bad. I'm surprised that Russell Crowe took an interest after looking at this disaster of a script. Think: The exorcist meets an American family with the stereotypical annoying disaffected teen daughter you've seen in countless bad movies...and set it in Europe in a scary old castle with skeletons in the basement. I thought I might be watching the next awful Indiana Jones installment. You won't care about the characters at all, even the padre. I couldn't wait for it to be over.","2/10"

Why cant they come up with something new and innovative?I had quite a few laughs watching it.If uyou are looking for a distracion or one movie that you can leave on while you make dinner so theres noise in the room, this is it. It will keep you entertained and laugh at the dialogs!","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","nickmarcantonio","4 May 2023","This could have been really good and considering that Russell Crowe signed on, this was a plus. However, HE is the whole movie. Unfortunately, he had a weak cast to work with, that combined with silly, over the top script and poor writing.Movie isn't scary at all, but Crowe is awesome, as always. I wish he could've had a decent cast to work with, but he didn't and as a result, he carried the entire movie. His Italian was on point and he played his part to perfection. Sadly, even Crowe couldn't have saved this one. I suspect this may appeal to younger audiences; that is to say, those who are experienced the power of 1973's The Exorcist and those who really didn't.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","joshaw-55534","11 November 2023","Just watched this, and as someone who is not a huge Russell Crowe fan, this was so goo, excellent I may say! He certainly brought the OG Gabriele Amorth back to life, the exorcisms looked very real, and it kept me on the edge of my seat! It's not all about action, there was a great storyline of how Gabriele Amorth came to this exorcism, the Spanish Inquisition, Asmodeus, and how the Devil and his henchmen can wreak havoc on the mortal realm.If you are a fan of the original The Exorcist and the series, I really do recommend giving it a watch. Even just rent it. I actually bought the dvd and wow. Love it. I'll be rewatching it for anything I may have missed!","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","uberdonkey6","9 May 2023","Russell Crowe is a good actor with lots of charisma. The plot has some interest but isn't delivered well because there is too much action and special effects at the end. The same story, with the same actors, would have been better with subtle reveals and more feeling for the family suffering possession. It's like too many films today: action and special effects as a priority and the story and characterisation coming second. In many ways I feel it was a missed opportunity. I feel Russell Crowe could have done more with a more measured film. Some bits too much of a copy of 'the exorcist'. Are they tipping a hat to that film? Maybe, but creating emotion and an intriguing story line would have been better.So, yeh, watch the film. You won't hate it. However, it's not directed at an intellectual audience, probably for those around 16 or 17 years old. Crow could have done this film as a retirement project because while he's good, it's like the film was aching to provide more depth for him. I blame the modern Hollywood script and direction teams that have made this film too similar to any other adventure/horror film. A forgettable film but will pass the time if nothing else to do.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","rgkarim","15 April 2023","LIKES:The Setting
-The movie may not be the most on jump scares, but the setting does great work to help this.-The movie is dark, without being too dark, setting this ambience of foreboding doom that I absolutely loved when it came to the film, always showing the darkness with a hint of light.-Use of lighting paints the movie in a horror tone, and though some of the lighting makes no sense in terms of story, I appreciated what they did to make this movie pop.-The Abbey has great feel of being abandoned and the conclave for this entire ordeal, while the church has this majesty and regal atmosphere when we are there to sort of counterbalance it.-This scenery is much of the thriller feel for this reviewer, and the movie theater adds a little ambience to help things out.The Special Effects
-While not the movie with the biggest wow factor, I do admit I loved what they did in terms of making this movie come to life.-The Sound editing is tops for most of the film, each element layering to be a tad creepy and disturbing, and then builds up much more horrifying sounds that work well with the music.-I'll group the music in this, but the orchestra work feels like a play back to the movies of the 80s-90s, but now with more definition and gruesome moments that make it more powerful.-The visual effects arise to really start being a nice touch, blood looking much more realistic than some movies, while the powers of the demon really get these well-blended touches that I can't say much about, but work well.-Even during the CGI heavy moments, the visuals hold well, a tad fake here and there, but otherwise showing how the marriage of real and computer are the best hybrids for making something come to life.-And for the makeup, well dang. I just love seeing these transformations, augmented by CGI, but really bringing this punch that works to make these gruesome, nightmarish scenes really stand out and get under my skin.-Amazing.The Acting/Voice Acting
-Ralph Ineson is the voice of the demon, and I think he knocked it out of the park. While it is certainly not the most unique voice, the dude has the emotions, inflections, and menace to sell the big bad antagonist of the film.-Shout out to Peter DeSouza-Feighoney a kid who may not have said a lot of things in his own voice, but matched the intensity of Ineson's voice work, and played possession really well at his young age. Really sold to me that he was in this state.-Essoe was good as the mom for the time she is in. I think she needs a little more work on the crying and playing distraught, but otherwise had the role down pat for me.-Zovatto did great for me. He's got the vulnerability and strength of a believable character, with mannerisms and expressions that did well to convey his character's journey through this ordeal. I absolutely loved his chemistry with Crowe, and the fact that someone so creepy, came off so amazing.-Crowe though is the winner for me with Ineson. He plays this role so well, a combination of comedy, strength and vulnerability that I absolutely loved in the blend. He's got delivery, he's got timing, and he brings out some very good emotional game without going too far. So good at what he accomplished in this movie amongst the rest of the crewThe Thriller Aspect
-The movie isn't so much a horror, but rather a thriller for me.-The Jump scares are there, but it really has more an occult vibe with our heroes trying to stop this entity and I really liked the approach this movie took.-It's creepy, though not as scary, but the theatrics paint this monster picture that is super enjoyable to watch.-I loved the pacing with it, the goals, the gradual expansion of the story, and the climactic ending that really feels like a war story from the Exorcism, with just enough horror elements to give it some edge rather than being an action thriller.The Mystery
-Another great facet to the movie is learning the source of this possession and what all lies within it.-The Pope's Exorcist does so well with layering the story, giving qualities to the event and adding layers that most Horror movies fail to do.-It's paced nicely to carry throughout the movie, never taking too much from the thrills, but yet never feeling like it's distraction.-Building the antagonist, learning about the ordeals leading to it, and even adding some chinks into the protagonist armor, all worked to build this movie up, and kept me intrigued to figure out what guesses of mine were accurate.The Comedy
-I know, a comedy in a horror movie is a hard act to merge.-Yet, this film did it, using it at just the right moments to relieve the tension, and again never going too hard.-It's a natural character quality to Crowe most of the time, his words and jokes a part of his tricks.-Other times, the timing and delivery are so great, that I just laughed at the placing, appreciating that balance the writers did.The Story/Character Development
-And surprisingly, this movie is indeed about the story elements and really bringing something to this movie to make it stand out.-Crowe and the demon have a lot more levels than I expected, and they play so well together as their pasts come to light. It's believable, relevant, and quite a great dance of strong wills that I enjoyed seeing this.-Then you have the other priest who too has his own demons to face and it works to help further the plot and the story, expanding past the typical roles.-There are subplots that melt into it as well, and this battle that the church is facing gets its fair representation without stealing the show, so it really does work for me in a narrative based movie.DISLIKES:The Predictability
-It is an exorcist movie, and unfortunately there is a lot of things you know are coming that you've seen before.-The way the bouts occur, the usual tricks that they do, the nature of the story, it's all in the usual deck of cards these movies do.-Doesn't mean it's awful, but... if you are looking for that unique spin, you most likely won't find much in this film, which is more a warning than anything else.Crossed One of My Lines
-The over use of the F word is not my line, but for space sakes, the F word gets a tad overused in this film to the point of blatant use and boredom. Given it's the second movie to do this, can't say that it helped things either.-No, the other line that crossed had to do with animals, and though CGI, there is an unnecessary need for this display when there were so many other things we could have done.-This won't be issues for most other viewers, but it's another warning and a reflection of again, animal use for the sake of just being torturing.Some Story Lines Needed More Work
-The movie is trying to juggle a lot of characters, and while they mostly work, their plots may have been lost to something else.-For me there are two storylines that potentially needed some smoothing out, one slightly, the other majorly.-One goes towards the opening scenes and this battle with clergy and Crowe. It's got a rather build up moment, and then sort of fizzles out, only saved by the ending and a few fleeting scenes.-The other has to do with the mom, daughter, and son. There is trauma, hurt, and a lot of other things to explore, but we get the bare minimum use of these characters and I think another ten to fifteen minutes would have done well to give them more use.The Power Scaling At The End
-The movie is all about building up the power and seeing these legendary figures fight. It's tough, the climb is a struggle and the realism is playing well as each dive into the mystery is revealed.-But then the ending happens. Now we get anime levels of fighting that start to feel like somehow people not quite equipped become super equipped.-The power scaling works with the theatrics, but after such careful and logical build up, this sudden miraculous birth of strength may be symbolic and metaphorical, but feels out of place given the pacing.The VERDICT:
The Pope's Exorcist may not be timed well or the scariest movie of the year, but what it does achieve is a story driven horror, where the characters, narrative, and setting do the best job of making an engaging film. There is a lot more balance than I thought, and for those of religious faith, it really serves a great merit to the levels they dove into this man's books and his struggles. With great acting, some good chemistry, and time dedication to making the world come to life, this thriller more than hits levels to make it worth the investment, with I believe the theater helping enhance a bit. Sadly, the movie will not hit the scare factor for most I believe, nor does it shine on the unique flavor you might be looking for. Story lines need some smoothing out alongside keeping the realism, but outside of that, there isn't going to be much that I can really bash this movie for, nor do I want to. With this in mind the movie overall in my score book is:Horror/Thriller: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","alfadyr-36212","20 January 2024","Movie was indeed not the best horror movie ever. Russel Crow was doing good. During most of the time gave daddy jokes. While a bit cringy he was relatable and cute. The others apart from the other priest at the place were only there to exist and didn't provide any depth or whatsoever.Speaking of the depth. The movie was so on the surface on the time. Not even trying to be slightly original from the ""yet another type of a exorcist movie"". But that is ok. If you don't take the movie seriously and watch it as an American popcorn movie that is. It is ok.It's a perfect movie to watch at home like me, when u are sick.

"The Pope's Exorcist","neil-476","17 April 2023","Father Gabriel Amorth, the Pope's Exorcist, has Cardinal Sullivan out for his blood when the Pope sends him to Spain to investigate a worring case of an American woman who, with her teenage sone and daughter, has moved into an old Abbey with past history dating back to the Inquisition. The son appears to have contracted a demon quite quickly.Amorth was a real person and this film purports to be based on reality. Without voicing an opinion on the man or his work, I personally suspect that this film consists entirely of made-up stuff to entertain a cinema audience. And it's entertaing. In the middle of all the usual supernatural shenanigans (because there's nothing going on here which you haven't seen before), Russell Crowe is having great fun as the clergyman who travels from Rome to Seville on a motor scooter, his exorcise kit strapped to the back (no crash helmet, he doesn't need one, you see), taking his ""It's a-da spicy meatballs"" accent with him.It's fun, and I'm sure it was meant to be. I'm not sure it ought to be, but that's another matter!I wasn't over-impressed with the lad who played the infected son. Also, I thought he was a girl for the longest time.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","jboothmillard","27 April 2023","I'd seen the trailer for this scary movie a couple of times, I saw it in a way as a warm-up from the release of the new Exorcist sequel in a few months (it's called The Exorcist), the leading actor made it appealing to me as well, directed by Julius Avery (Son of a Gun, Overlord). Basically, set in 1986, Father Gabriel Amorth (Razzie nominated Russell Crowe) is an Italian Catholic priest, an earthy, scooter-riding, humorous, practical man, and the Vatican's leading exorcist; he is the personal exorcist of the Pope (Razzie nominated Franco Nero). He is visiting an Italian village where a man is seemingly possessed by a demon. The man is tied up in his bedroom, Amorth and the local priest enter the room to perform an exorcism. During the process, using a Saint Benedict Medal sacramental, Amorth drives the demon into a pig, which is then killed with a shotgun. This incident gets Amorth in trouble with a Church tribunal, as he acted without permission from his superiors. The tribunal members include friendly African Bishop Lumumba (Cornell John) who respects Amorth, and vicious American Cardinal Sullivan (Ryan O'Grady) who is sceptical of demonic possession. Amorth tells his superiors that evil does exist, and that he did not perform a true exorcism, but rather, some psychological theatre to help the mentally disturbed man. Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal. In Spain, single mother Julia (Alex Essoe) has travelled from America to a mysterious old Spanish abbey which was Henry's father's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident. She moves into the abbey with her rebellious teenage Amy (Laurel Marsden) and her young son Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) who was in the car accident that killed his father Roberto (Santi Bay√≥n), he is still traumatised and has not spoken a word since it happened. The abbey is being restored by workman and Julia intends to sell it, but they are forced to leave when a sinister fire occurs. Slowly, Henry starts behaving bizarrely, speaking vulgar words in a demonic voice (Ralph Ineson). He is given serum chemistry treatment and an MRI scan, but the results show nothing abnormal. Henry, diabolically possessed, requests a priest. The local Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto) arrives, but Henry obscenely expresses contempt for him. The Pope assigns Father Amorth to visit the possessed boy in Spain. Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as his assistant, although Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist. Esquibel says he has heard of Amorth but not read his books. Amorth advocates the importance of prayer, though Esquibel makes mistakes during their exorcisms, including strangling Henry when the demon antagonises him, mocking him for his sins. The duo is unsuccessful exorcising Henry, as he utters blasphemous phrases during the rite. The demon even possesses Amy at times. Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood, but he convinces her to pray after she reveals she believed her guardian angel helped her in childhood. In Rome, the Pope becomes ill while reading documents about the Spanish case and goes to hospital. Amorth finds a well on the grounds of the abbey, beneath it is a complex sealed off chamber. He learns that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition, an exorcist, was possessed by a dangerous demon. The Church covered this up and placed him inside a cage inside this chamber. Exploring the chamber, Amorth also discovers the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism. Amorth and Esquibel participate in the sacrament of Confession and Absolution, mutually confessing their sins. Amorth was an Italian partisan, he survived World War II and vowed to serve God in gratitude, but he did not save a mentally ill woman who asked him for help due to his pride, she committed suicide and he has felt guilty since. Esquibel fornicated with a young woman he did not later marry. The two absolve each other for their sins and ready themselves to exorcise Henry. Amorth instructs Esquibel to wear a Miraculous Medal necklace. During the exorcism, they have horrible visions of the women whom they failed. The exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, following Asmodeus previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth. Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon does not allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church. However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon. Amorth is freed from the demon, as is Henry, and the Pope recovers in hospital. The triumphant Amorth and Esquibel visit Rome, finding Sullivan has taken leave in Guam, being replaced by Lumumba. Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive. Lumumba tells them they will be visiting hundreds of other sites suspected to have evil spirits, with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to fight against the Devil. Amorth jokingly says, ""We're going to Hell!"" The film ends with details about the real Amorth's career including his writing many books. Also starring Bianca Bardoe as Rosaria, Paloma Bloyd as Interpreter, Alessandro Gruttadauria as Father Gianni, River Hawkins as Enzo / Halphas, Jordi Collet as Carlos, Edward Harper-Jones as Young Amorth, and Matthew Sim as Cardinal Abato. Crowe with his up and down Italian accent does give a good performance as the experienced priest unafraid to go against satanic forces and with a sense of humour. It is fair to say it has similarities to the 1973 Exorcist (especially towards the end), there is not much original stuff, but the child possessed by evil and demonic battle sequences do get your attention, and the lead character is likeable, as an overall film it's a standard-issue just about reasonable supernatural horror. Okay!","2/10"

Omg practical effects are way more effective in terms of frights.Russell Crowe always seems to have a way of commanding a scene. This was surely a wasted script.

"The Pope's Exorcist","pinballwizard-83712","7 May 2023","Julius Avery's intriguing and gripping well-crafted horror film that truly delivers an entertaining scary good time. About the Chief Vatican Exorcist Father Gabrieie Amorth, marvelously played by Russell Crowe who delivers a brilliant nuanced star performance with some wisecracking humor that makes his portrayal so endearing, Father Amorth is ordered by the Pope, superbly played by Franco Nero, to Spain to a remote old abbey that has been inherited by an American mother Julia, teenage daughter Amy, terrifically played Alex Essoe and Laurel Marsden, and young son Henry, impressively played by Peter De Souza-Feighoney, who has been possessed by a powerful hateful demon that means to use the boy as bait to destroy Father Amorth. A young local Spanish Priest named Father Esquibel, wonderfully played by Daniel Zovatto, who has no idea on how to deal with possession will assist Father Amorth in battling this dark vengeful entity, and they make a great team together. Solid direction by Avery, who gives his film excellent and chilling scenes of horror with impressive visual effects. Beautiful cinematography by Khalid Mohtaseb, with an effective creepy score by Jed Kurzel. This surprise box office hit was way better than I thought it was going to be, and Crowe's committed performance is what makes this horror thriller work so well.","7/10"

That matched with some really funny physical gags, Russel takes an impromptu pussy-lick shower with holy water and uses his Vesper as a pulling machine, it really was very inventive.I really wanted it to be really scary and deeply offensive but the core horror was a bit beige and it was over CGI'd, the script writer needed to refresh their horror psyches with a quick view of Omen 1.For any horror enthusiast this deliver in spades so I'm giving it a firm 7 outta 10, if you don't like occult horror don't go, simples!","10/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","alvdora-32334","4 May 2023","This movie was the best exorcist movie I've seen so far. It's creepy, shocking, and more complex than the other ones out there. I watched it twice in a row, and the 2nd time I realized that there was more to the story than I had originally thought. Example: the young man getting irate at the meeting with Gabe, the demon saying he's infiltrated the church, they make it seem he's going to use Gabe but then when Gabe begins to fight the demon from within himself that same young man falls to his knees in agony in the church and has to go on a sabbatical. Which implies that he had already began to influence the church by using him to denounce the exorcist. And saying that an exorcist is no longer needed within the church. Like I said the movie is more than just fear inducing. It's also thought inducing. Which is something we are beginning to see in a lot of newer horror movies. I love a good scary movie that's not all college girls with big boobs screaming and running up the stairs like idiots. Definitely recommend this movie. Very much worth the $19.99 I spent on renting it.","2/10"

Seen oh so many times, chewed upon, yet with the same silly approach, ancient beliefs, tricks, insanities that no one of this generation feels like swallowing any more. It's quite shocking in fact to what a poor scenario Russell Crowe signed up. He acted like he can't be bothered, the others couldn't even deliver that much. At points I was wondering if it was meant to be a parody or a horroresque.If it wasn't for the good special effects, this would have been a one-star-don't-waste-your-time movie, but I graciously gave it two. I skipped the predictable end, the last half hour, whereas in fact I should have skipped the film altogether.","6/10"

It's a bit scary at times, but not too much. The story is ok but could have been better. This movie reminds me a bit of The Ninth Gate.If you like this kinda stuff, I recommend also checking out The Gift (2000) with Kate Blanchett, Frailty (2001), What Lies Beneath (2000), Dragonfly (2002), and if you are in for a really strong drink based on a true story: The Conjuring (2013). There are also good older movies to check out, such as Angel Heart (1987) with Robert De Niro and Mickey Rourke.In literature there is also the splendid, short book by Bill Wiese, ""23 Minutes in Hell"" which the author claims is also a true story.","7/10"

He plays a tortured soul who should have saved a young woman, but did not. Your sins will seek you out... and the demon who possesses the boy adheres to this adage, providing an excellent plot point to elevate this film above most of the other exorcist films.Worth a watch.","1/10"

Is the only one in that priest's books?I understand that they tried to bring a different kind of prist, that had a different look to the situations, but the mix of little jokes and a such a superficial characters and situations just made it a bad movie.They actually had the nerve to absolve the catolic church form the horrors of the inquisition. It was a ""demon"" that possessed the church, guys, not the persons that killed other people because o their on volition.And, with no surprise, the demons that the priests face in the final battle had the shape of women. ""but it's because of their's personal lives that...."" Stop.Is possible to make new stories. Good ones, please.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","poulos69","16 August 2023","Entertaining film about exorcism based on the real chief exorcist of the Vatican. Russell Crowe does a great job portraying Father Gabrielle. Even speaks in Italian for a part of the movie. The film starts off as believable stories of demonic possession, but halfway through it becomes a special effects extravaganza with possessed teenager climbing the walls and ceiling like Spiderman, illusions of other people manifesting as if they are real flesh and bone, lots of skin deformation of the possessed, and more. I found it entertaining even though it was way over the top. Overall a good production.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","drjgardner","2 May 2023","It's just another exorcist film. If you like that find of film you'll like this one. They substitute head twisting for mouth enlargement but otherwise it's the same old stuff. Not that it's bad. Just SOS.The acting is good and the tie -in to history is a little bit interesting. One good aspect is the appearance of Franco Nero as the Pope. The two kids, Peter DeSourza-Feighoney and Laurel Marsden do most of the work and they do it well.Russel Crow's acting varies from horrible to very good. Here he is pretty good so that's a welcome change from Robin Hood, Man of Steel, Irons Fists, and Noah.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","shayaniroomloo","4 May 2023","What do we get from this movie? Nothing really.We only see the repetition of previous exorcism movies. Only with the difference that Russell Crowe is a famous exorcist.If I want to say the remarkable potential of this movie, it is two things;Russell Crowe's relatively good acting with his interesting Italian accent and the film's acceptable makeupBut the script, which is the main chain of the film, was very weak. The acting of the actors was ordinary and finally the visual effect of the film was a disaster.Overall, this movie failed to satisfy me. And I only recommend this movie to those who like to watch repeated exorcism movies.Shayan Iroomloo Tabrizi.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","destiny_west","4 May 2023","I am a fan of the Netflix documentary The Devil and Father Amorth. If you haven't seen it definitely check it out, it is about the real Father Amorth. I was excited to see The Pope's Exorcist, though slightly put off as the reviews started appearing.I have to say that I really enjoyed it. Russell Crowe was really good as Father Amorth and I absolutely loved the fictionalised story line about the Spanish Inquisition. All the supporting cast were really good as well.My only criticism of the film is that I think some of the demon's dialogue was a bit corny. The whole calling him Gabe and a few other things made me cringe, but I was able to overlook it due to the quality of the film. Definitely a great exorcism film. No its not The Exorcist - nothing will ever compare to that film. However, The Pope's Exorcist would have to be one of the better possession films of the last ten years.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","darkreignn","16 April 2023","If you thought the Pope's job was tough, wait till you see what his exorcist has to deal with! If you thought that was a corny introductory sentence for this review, well, you're right - it was, however, my intention to kick things off as closely as possible to the way ""The Pope's Exorcist"" starts, as the movie itself begins in a similarly cheesy manner. Don't let my intro, or the film's for that matter, fool you, because this movie sets its intentions from the very beginning; ""The Pope's Exorcist"" is everything you've already seen done before from an exorcism movie, but perhaps never this self-aware and entertaining.Honestly, I loved this movie, and I was dreading walking into the theatre if nothing else because of the absolutely awful exorcism themed movies that were released in recent memory (""Prey for the Devil"" and ""The Unholy"" come to mind). I wanted to go and see one movie today (April 15, 2023), and I chose this over ""Renfield"" simply for the fact that Russel Crowe was playing Father Gabriel Amorth. Not even being a huge Russel Crowe fan, I know that he always gives 110% of himself in every single role (I mean, have you seen ""Unhinged?), and since I had enough Cinemark credits for a free ticket, I figured I'd give this a chance - and I'm so glad I did because I was so, so entertained by ""The Pope's Exorcist.""Listen, you're going to get exactly what you expect when walking into this movie: Someone projectile vomiting blood? Check. The possessed person spewing profanities and over-the-top sexual remarks? You better believe it. Someone contorting their body to crab-walk across the ceiling? Oh, heck yeah, that's in here! However, where past exorcism horror films have taken themselves way too seriously, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" has an air of self-awareness to it that led to a great sense of fun throughout, thanks in part to Russel Crowe's energetic performance.Crowe looks like he's having the time of his life here, playing a quick-witted, whiskey loving priest, and his energy radiates off the screen - I mean, I can't remember ever seeing a priest have this much personality in an exorcism film before, and it's so entertaining to watch Crowe in this role. And the movie as a whole has a really campy vibe to it overall, which I certainly didn't anticipate, but it was a welcome change of pace when compared to today's recent dark, dreary, and overly serious horror films. However, this movie is a horror film, and so we must talk about that.Honestly, I didn't find this movie scary at all, but the elderly woman sitting next to me was literally jumping at everything and covering her eyes every time something ""scary"" happened, so that right there tells you that some people will, and apparently are, finding this movie scary. And while I can only imagine that those who are scared by this movie have most likely never seen a horror film before in their lives, I have to say that, for me personally, the lack of scares didn't bother me because of how much entertainment value the film had. The exorcism sequences were a lot of fun, even if they were filled with the usual cliches. Director Julius Avery helmed the film, and I honestly think his direction elevated things past the typical exorcist fare - he has a really great sense of visual style to his movies (i.e., ""Overlord""), and so ""The Pope's Exorcist"" had a lot of cool sights to behold in terms of visuals. Sure, there's some CGI, but it honestly didn't bother me as the film played its exorcism sequences less to be scary and more to be thrilling; this is more of a thriller than a horror film, in my opinion, and I was thrilled - the climax especially had enough sights and sounds that even Helen Keller would find herself caught up in it all.""The Pope's Exorcist"" is, simply put, a ton of fun. I walked into the theatre expecting to hate this, and I walked out in love with it because of how entertained I was. Sure, it's nothing too innovative, but Russel Crowe's dedicated, infectious performance drew me in more than I thought possible, and the film has just enough supernatural escapades (wait until you see the pig) that even the most jaded horror fans will certainly find something to be entertained by.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","demonblade-37792","15 April 2023","The Pope's Exorcist is about Father Gabriel Amorth (Russell Crowe) doing excorism as his job. Until one day, he reaches a case that is the most difficult exorcism from a family who just moved into a house in Spain. A powerful demon takes control of a boy and unleashes hell on his family that Father Amorth can only solve. He must save the boy from the demon or they will lose their souls forever.Overall, I thought the entertainment value, story, and acting is good. Russell Crowe does a great job as acting in his role in a priest performing exorcisms. Shoutouts to the production crew that made the film more dark and demonic. It is based on a true story that gives more of a background to the story than it relies on less jumpscares. I became invested into Father Amorth's and the other Priest protagonist stories. I would recommend The Pope's Exorcist in theaters for a good horror watch.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","rogier-86785","29 October 2023","As horror goes, The Pope's Exorcist is more on the action-packed and classic side, with a possession story that combines elements of grief, mysterious objects, haunted house, history, deception and jump scares. It is well executed and played, and feels like a good, solid horror story with great action energy. As such it deserves a higher rating here than it gets.Although frightening, the film will definitely not be the scariest horror you'll ever see. It relies on well-known horror tropes, which allows it to quickly get to the point of exorcising and drive the story forwards, sometimes more akin to an action-thriller.This reliance on established cues however, also means it can mix new elements in it. The contentious relationship of main protagonist priest Gabriele Amorth (Crow's character) with the church being the absolute highlight for me. The dialogue in these scenes is often better than the horror elements all together. And a nice hidden sense of humor about faith tops it off well.Amorth as a character is also highly lovable (what's in a name), and Crow's depiction of him is another highlight for the actor. Which is saying something... because in real life Amorth was quite controversial. However, this is more of a fantastical historical demon story, that seems to just use a name to make a good movie, and in no way seems historically accurate. There seems to even be a mild setup for future story, so maybe we'll see more.All in all, don't let the lower ratings from reviewers fool you. Horror always gets a bad rap from them. This is a well-executed and entertaining exorcism story with a focus on action, twists and turns and some deeper historical thoughts. In other words, you'll have a good time.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","hamoo","17 August 2023","As per other reviews, russell crowe's performance was flawless, however, he alone is carrying the movie. The chances are good that the only reason for laurel marsden's role as amy is to connect with the teenage audience, however, amy didn't do it for me. But it wasn't laurel that ruined the movie, it was the sound effects. The sound effects are just too obnoxiously loud, to the point that it gave me a headache. Then, when i lowered the volume to be able to tolerate the movie, i couldn't hear the dialogue. That's the bottom line. Deafening, overpowering sound effects trying to make a make believe demon is evil. No, if you want to be horrified look at something real that people do, like war. Or take a look at what the people of the faroe islands did to the dolphins.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","arfdawg-1","6 May 2023","This could have been a much better movie with better writing and a far better possessed kid.That said, it's a watchable movie but the scenes with the possessed boy are filled with unintentional laughs because he's such a horrible actor being forced to deliver really moronic lines.Further, it's never explained why a possessed American boy who is living in Spain gets a Brittish accent when the demon comes by. He sounds like Golum from Lord of the Rings.And he delivers the most idiotic speeches. Not to mention, the demon keeps telling everybody they are going to die but he never gets out of bed! He's not tied down like Linda Blair was so what's up with that?There's even a scene with the sister right out of Nightmare on Elm Street! Gee.Crowe is decent in it but that kid.... oy! He's the worst actor on planet Earth.The marketing material says this is ""loosely"" based on a true story. That clearly means it's complete fiction.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","OhmPhanphiroj","26 October 2023","One of the worst movies about exorcism. Don't know which is worst, this one or the exorcist believer. With all the money that they have to spend and the years of watching the original, these pathetic fools till cannot come up with better script. The directors are equally bum skulled and have no clue how to tell a story. The whole thing about this movie is vile, pathetic and unbelievable. The cast are all wrong. The possessed boy looks like a whimpy girl whose acting ability is worse than my parrot mimicking my dog's barking. Awful to the max. The script is poor written. Russell Crow must be super desperate and needed money badly to be in such horrid movie. His acting is so pretentious and awful that I thought he needs to go back to acting school all over again.I am so glad i watched it for free, otherwise I would have sued everyone in the film.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","sashairk","11 May 2023","While I'm not a big fan of horror movies, Russell Crowe was brilliant here in the role of an exorcising monk, Father Gabriel Amorth. It was a real pleasure to watch him acting in that role, a great difference from his usual characters that he used to play.Unlike the 'classic' Exorcist movie this movie has the message that the Gates of Hell were actually opened by the Inquisition with its multiple tortures and murders. So it was sort of 'mea culpa' for that dark period of the Catholic Church.Therefore, this film should not be viewed as a regular scary flick whose only purpose is just to entertain the viewers by watching just another scary stuff. I definitely recommend it even to those who usually stay away from this kind of genre.","9/10"

Which I actually like a lot.From the beginning till the end this movie keeps going strong and keeps you in it's story. I really hope the creators will make a 2nd movie as it definitely would be great to see how the story continues.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","BlueBird84","24 July 2023","It commits the worst sin a horror movie can commit. It is bad without being funny-bad. And it's boring to boot. The possessed children are laughable (but not actually, because you must remember this movie isn't funny). Father Amorth is a baffling character, hailed as the best exorcist around but strangely blase about his faith and his profession, seeming to take neither very seriously. Very few attempts at scares. The movie takes a couple stabs at being shocking and consistently fails. Both priests seem to have a combined IQ of 70. All characters are paper-thin and poorly developed. If I wasn't on a plane I would have stopped this halfway through.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","sanjubhat","3 August 2023","Film Review: The Pope's Exorcist streaming on NetflixBased on true incidents of exorcism conducted by Father Gabreille Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist , this film focuses on one incident in 1987 where Father Amorth and Father Tomas perform an exorcism to rid a young innocent boy of a powerful demon who has bigger plans which involve the Vatican and beyond !! In doing so, the 2 protagonists have to battle their own personal demons & so does the Vatican... Will our protagonists emerge as victors!!Russell Crowe as father Amorth, the whiskey drinking protagonist with a quirky sense of humour has an imposing screen presence and carries the film on his strong shoulders all throughout. Daniel Zovatto as Father Tomas ably supports Crowe in his fight against evil.The film is set in a remote Abbey in Spain, the ambience is dull, gloomy and sets the perfect precedance for a great horror film !! Not the scariest film ever, it however has a few decent jumpscare moment's. I would call it more of an adventure horror movie rather than a hardcore horror film. A bit of a dampner for hardcore horror film buffs!!Plans are in place to create a franchise and a sequel has already been announced !! Would love to see more paranormal adventures of Father Amorth & Tomas in future !!Going with 3/5 for this one ...

"The Pope's Exorcist","bbosma-24403","3 November 2023","As a movie, this isn't bad. Well put together, reasonable script, some good moments. What makes it worth watching is Russell Crowe. He hasn't been in many great things lately, but man ... he can act. He makes the character of Father Gabrielle Amorth - the Pope's Exorcist - interesting, amusing, likeable but most of all believable. That's important, since Father Amorth was a real person and he actually was the Vatican's chief exorcist. While Father Amorth is an intelligent man who recognises that 98% of the cases he is called to attend are actually not possession but mental health issues, on this occasion he confronts the real deal - and it's him the demon actually wants. Not for everyone, but as I said, worth watching just to see Russel Crowe making it obvious that he is still one of the best actors around.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","fnfighter","14 May 2023","If I had to choose between this or the new Evil Dead I would pick Evil Dead. This movie wasn't bad. But honestly, it wasn't the greatest. It's just too slow in my opinion. But the plot being so sinister did make it a bit more scary and I'm definitely glad I watched it. But if I had to choose between this or the New Evil Dead. The new Evil Dead was more satisfying to our family. Edge of the seat type of scary. So if you are broke like me and don't want to spend that hard earned money, go with what I said. Unless you are completely new to demon type movies then I could be wrong. But we've seen so many it's meh.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Ali-Hasnain","9 May 2023","I recently watched a horror movie for the first time, as I used to believe that horror movies were a waste of time since it seemed illogical to purposely induce fear in oneself under normal circumstances. However, due to Russell Crowe's involvement in the movie, I decided to give it a chance. Overall, the movie was quite enjoyable and managed to hold my attention throughout. However, I was disappointed with the director's choice for the ending, as the supposedly fearless and stubborn demon was easily defeated with just a prayer. I feel that the ending could have been improved. Nevertheless, I must commend Russell Crowe for his brilliant acting performance. I would rate the movie 7 out of 10.","10/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","teacheranarivera","7 May 2023","Even though the movie is some kind of slow, we need to remember that the important thing here is that is a non-fiction story base on a true character. I do like it. I like the performance of Russell Crowe and the way they connect the story of the crusades with the demon explanation. For me was very well development and if the story was exactly like they shows in the movie, was really creepy. The only thing that I found not too good was the thing that the movie take 2 hrs and for me that's too long. Other than that, the other performance of the other characters was good. Specially the little boy who the demon posses.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","zzorn88","1 June 2023","It's been a while since we've seen an exorcist style movie come off the main stream of Hollywood. I will say that it is great to see Russell Crowe back in action after having a rocky career. I can really tell that he got into his role as the popes right hand exorcist man .. It's the fake Italian accent and especially seeing him ride in on a scooter that did it for me LOL.The plot line felt decent but it did have one twist too many. It was interesting to see the dynamic share between Crow and forces of darkness being that there's a score to settle. The child actor who is possessed by the ""demon"" did an excellent job at his role. Although the CGI effects were effective I did feel a sense of cheesiness about the make up and other actors participating this film.Overall I give us movie at 6.66 out of 10 seeing as how we are talking about evil trying to take over the world. I also give Russell Crowe a solid 8/10 for his over acting, enthusiastic character building, and mini scooter riding. I can't wait to see if they're going to make a sequel as that's how they set up the ending. Definitely worth a watch if you're into horror movies or exorcism films.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","jayboyjay","6 April 2023","I'll keep this brief. It's nothing you haven't seen before, however Russel Crowe does bring a certain gravitas to his character. Some.of the themes of belief and the power of unwaivering faith are briefly touched upon but the usual cgi fare, bombastic set pieces and the ""true story"" tropes are all here for everyone to see. Imagine Constantine meets the exorcist with a big of see no evil (Eric Bana) and your kinda in the ball park. Not a horror classic, not even an exorcism classic but Crowe does do well in his role and his accent is way better than Thor love and thunder. Passable popcorn flick. 5/10.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","highwingremnants","6 May 2023","It lifts the majority of its details straight from The Exorcist. Old experienced exorcist teams with younger priest with zero exorcism experience? The child's case has been dismissed by medical authorities as psychological trauma? The child is tied to bed for everyone's safety? The young priest loses temper and attacks child after demon reads his mind and plays on his weak points? A teenage girl's body distorts into the spider-walk? The implausibly copious vomiting of liquid straight into a clergyman's face? The demon referring to people as pigs? The possessed child's face being a mass of lacerations and their belly showing word messages like an information board? The demon is ultimately defeated via priest inviting the demon to take him instead? They're all here!Everything it bolts on that wasn't in The Exorcist is terrible 2000s horror rubbish: stretchy face CGI, jarringly prominent and numerous licensed songs, videogame fiery sigils, 2D characters with seemingly no internal substance or intelligence. Hmm, a huge stone seal bearing the symbol of the Vatican. I'll attach that to my vespa and haul that straight off. What's this now: another stone door marked by the Inquisition? Smash it down. A famous exorcist voluntarily locked himself in a cage and swallowed the key to protect an ominous iron door? Let's get into his guts and unlock that immediately. And no, that doesn't mean it's good-bad. I love enjoyably terrible films. This is not one.Even the demon is weak. It's meant to be Hell's baddest, but its most solid burn is to repeatedly call the exorcist ""Gabe"" instead of ""Gabriel"". There's no imagination here to make you buy the idea that there's a dangerous evil inside the kid rather than a slightly annoying goblin.I will admit that it's nicely shot, but that's about it. Okay, The Exorcist is an enduring classic and perhaps it's unreasonable to expect another film to reach that height, but couldn't it at least try? It fails to be even a tenth as good as a 50-year-old film.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ma-cortes","29 October 2023","An acceptably watchable exorcism thriller but with some failures , gaps and flaws. Based on Fr. Gabriel Amorth's life, a known exorcist priest who made over 150 exorcisms. For 2,000 years the Vatican has recorded evidence of evil . May God have mercy on their souls. Following Gabriele Amorth (Russell Crowe), the Vatican's leading exorcist, as he's called by the Pope (Franco Nero) upon to exorcise the demon, as he investigates the possession of a child, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) living in Spain, suffering from the effects of being possessed by the devil and uncovers a conspiracy the Vatican has tried to keep secret. Henry, satanically possessed, asks for a priest; the local Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto) arrives, but Henry abuses him and says, ""Wrong priest. The possession proves to be an ancient satanic force more powerful than ever imagined. There is something dark and sinister inside Henry, a nasty demon that goes bersek and the exorcist wants to eject it. The child begins to have a devastating effect on anyone close, causing serious injury and death. He getting sicker by the time, being really possessed, so a demon into a kid gone amok. As Gabriele attempts to help the possessed child and submitting him weird exorcisms .There are some things best kept in secret !.The Pope's Exorcist (2023) is a creepy and horror film about exorcism, professionally, though flawed, directed by Julius Avery. Truly terrifiyng story following the ultimate battle between good and evil - God versus Satan √≥ Asmodeus. Horror picture shot in fits and starts with incoherent, predictible and well-known plot, dealing with a ghastly possession, as a kid is possessed by a malevolent and heinous spirit causing creepy, scary and terrible moments ; then , a Vatican exorcist and a young priest must do battle with an ancient satanic force to save the soul of the strange child. A rare and scary film about exorcism in similar style to classic The Exorcist 1973 by William Friedkin. Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth, Chief Exorcist of the Vatican, The Pope's Exorcist follows Amorth as he investigates a young boy's terrifying possession and ends up uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden. William Friedkin's The Exorcist's movie remains still startling and engrossing with every viewing, it spread countless sequels and imitations, one of them is this one, though , of course, it is far cry from the original. Genuinely scary moments overcome some obvious plot devices. This is a juicy terrifying material fashioning an iconic diabolic possession, providing screams, thrills, shocks and chilling scenes .It has an extremely known premise spawns the film in ups and downs. The Pope well played by Franco Nero makes references to the Fallen Angels, these come from the 'Book of Enoch', an ancient Hebrew apocalyptic religious text, attributed by tradition to Enoch, Noah's great-grandfather. The Book of Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons. 200 angels, who were called The Watchers, lusted after human women and came down to earth on Mount Hermon in the days of Jared (Noah's father). These fallen angels cohabited with human women and produced giants of human-angel hybrid called the Nephilim, and about why some angels fell from heaven, as well as an explanation of why the flood, as narrated in Genesis, would have been morally necessary, and a prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah. All semblance of plausibility is extracted, leaving a main and support cast of decent actors : Russell Crowe who had accompanied Amorth in order to better know the role he was playing, Daniel Zovatto, Alexandra Essoe, Laurel Marsden, Cornell John, while screaming, fleeing and be afraid of the strange possessions, poltergeisters and phenomena.It delivers a scary and eerie ambient thanks to expert cameraman Khalid Mohtaseb. As well as a frightening, suspenseful and chilling musical score by Jed Kurzel. Being efficiently produced by Sophie Cassidy, Homewood, Michael Patrick Kaczmarek, Jeff Katz, including abundant FX of possession and other visual effects in computer generator. This non-sense , late night horror picture was passably directed by Julius Avery , though with no originality and it has some flaws and gaps. Julius Avery has directed a few acceptable films such as : Samaritan (2022) with Sylvester Stallone, Overlord (2018) with Iain De Caestecker, Wyatt Russell, Pilou Asb√¶ka and Son of a Gun (2014) with Ewan McGregor and Brenton Thwaites. Rating: 6/10. The picture will appeal to Russell Crowe fans and horror genre enthusiasts.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","dannyboymcny-1","19 August 2023","I didn't exactly understand why there was a panel to ask questions of Father Amorth, not why some young American seemed to be leading the panel while older men with far more experience remained quiet. Given that Amorth was given a mandate to do what he was doing by the Pope they (he) had no actual authority, which Amorth recognized.The idea that the majority of possession cases was small worked for me. Mental illness was misunderstood in the past and so possession seemed to be an answer. Yet the idea that supernatural evil did exist was important.I had no issue with the acting or the possessed children. How were they supposed to sound? They sounded convincing to me. Not scary in the jump scare style often seen but instead in the idea that children children are being victimized and why 'lesser' targets were chosen. Fly under the radar to achieve a greater purpose.There were also doubts that were able to be exorcised by experience, forgiveness and need. That last part seems important and why the final showdown with Asmodeus turned out the way it did.It was the ending that was the chilling part. We knew about past plans for controlling or destroying religions but this was something else entirely. The bishops at the Vatican nearly gave the demons exactly what they needed. Instead, the Vatican gained the tools necessary to take the demons head on. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel because this movie is clearly set up for one.If you're looking for a deep horror, rather than blood, gore, and scare tactics, I think this is the one. The implied scale of what is going on, and what also went on centuries earlier, should be enough to put chills in anyone.","10/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","TxMike","3 October 2023","This is not normally a movie I would seek out but I always find
Russell Crowe's roles interesting, some great. The DVD box says this movie ""was inspired by"" the experiences and writings of Father Gabriel Amorth, a Roman Catholic priest at the Vatican, working directly under the Pope. Most of his career he was the Vatican's exorcist. But he would tell those who inquired, about 98% of the cases referred to him required psychological treatment, only about 2% of the cases did it require exorcism.There are two things going on in this movie. First is Father Amorth in his work as an exorcist and we see an example of that as the movie begins. The other is an American family, mother, rebellious teenage daughter, and non-verbal young son. The husband and dad had died about a year earlier, the wife had inherited a Spanish Abbey that had been in the husband's family for generations. They traveled there to get it suitably fixed up to sell then head back to the States.The abbey had a dark history and soon after they arrived strange things started happening. Then the young son seemed to become possessed. Father Amorth was sent to evaluate it and take care of it. Things get really, really weird.It is important to remember this was ""inspired by"" and not intended to be a faithful telling of the exorcist's experiences.

The horror is so evil and scary that I found it hard to watch some of the scenes. The antagonist is played by two exorcists and one of them is Russell Crowe. His trust in God is so strong and deep that it takes away all fear, including the fear of the viewer. And that is exactly what makes the film unique. He provokes the demon by showing no fear and making sarcastic jokes. And he explains why he does this: demons hate jokes. Crowe takes away the fear by explaining everything that happens and why the demon does it.Russell Crowe's role as the Pope's exorcist suits him perfectly. I'm not saying this role surpasses his role as Maximus in Gladiator, but it's just as great.We all know that Russell Crowe is one of the most respected actors in the world, and no one would expect him to play a role in a franchise. But this role? I think he would do it. Mark my words.Verdict: Recommended viewing, for anyone who can handle this kind of horror. A fascinating film.","10/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","Real_Review","10 June 2023","The Pope sends Russell Crowe on adventures as an exorcist.This is a strange film. I have seen many exorcist-themed horror films, and most are rather 'blah'. This film is not 'blah'. I'm not used to seeing a cliche horror film with a real budget - but, I suppose this isn't a generic, cliche horror film. I remember being surprised that Vera Farmiga was starring in 'The Conjuring' series, but I was shocked that Russell Crowe was making this film. The horror movie model is profitable because there is little up-front investment. However, this film hired a real lead actor, had a real cast with some depth, and was filmed in a few different locations - there was a $20 million investment to create an outstanding horror movie experience.The efforts were successful - this is a good film that will have you on the edge of your seat. The ending suggests that this might be a series (like 'The Conjuring' was created into a thematic series), so long as they can keep Russell Crowe interested. Either way, 'The Pope's Exorcist' (2023) is among the best of the many exorcist-themed horror films.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:Acting: 1/1;Casting: 1/1;Directing: 1/1;Story: 1/1;Writing/Screenplay: 1/1;Total Base Score = 5Modifiers (+ or -):Music Score/Soundtrack: + 0.5 (A horror movie with a real soundtrack.

"The Pope's Exorcist","exceladeogun","5 June 2023","The Pope's ExorcistRussell Crowe leads this horror supernatural Da Vinci code-esque flick with a charismatic and commanding performance.The plot isn't anything innovative, but it is still entertaining. The scares, special effects and CGI are good, nothing extra but fitting for the genre.Russell Crowe as Father Amorth is phenomenal. He's cool, he's tough, and he delivers his comedic and witty dialogues with precision. The supporting cast aren't as polished as Russell, but they don't detract from the movie. It would have helped greatly if the demon/possessed child had shown more presence and power, rather than lazily remaining bound on the bed.7/10.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","kyliemm","31 October 2023","This film was awesome. I don't watch a lot of exorcism films so I didn't have high hopes. I got more than I expected so I was pleasantly surprised!Russell Crowe made an amazing Italian priest and chief exorcist. I had no idea Father Amorth was a real man until I looked it up. I'm not a huge fan of Russell Crowe but he played this man to perfection as far as I could tell.Father Amorth travels to Spain to investigate a possession of a young boy but he uncovers much more than what there appears to be. I gotta admit, part of it made me really uncomfortable, which is what I expect out of a horror film.If you're a fan of horror in general, especially of exorcism films, this is right up your alley.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ivoryturtle","5 May 2023","Ok, so Father Gabrielle has the same back-story as Father Merrin from the original Exorcist series from way back. Nothing new, nothing original. Same regurgitated tripe. The Rite (Anthony Hopkins) was better ten years ago than this. That was an astounding exorcist movie! Even the sequels to the original Exorcist movies were better. This had no tension, no impact, no stakes. A snooze. Even Crowe's acting couldn't avert this.If they intend on making a franchise out of this, they need to stop repeating themselves over and over and over again. Who gets clearance to make these endlessly repeating stories? Is this for the benefit of Gen Z which has no prior knowledge of superior films and therefore deems something like this acceptable?","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","traiancarutasu","10 April 2023","When you want to play an Italian priest, you have to learn to speak Italian without an English accent. The script was boring and Russell Crowe's performance was ruined by the Italian pronunciation. Even the main actor found it difficult to maintain his seriousness in front of so many ridiculous lines. I almost felt bad that a great legend like Franco Nero accepted to play in this movie - it was the only good performance of the cast. Unfortunately, not even him could save such a bad script. The special effects and sound were more suitable for a cheap roller coaster adventure than for a film with a religious and spiritual bent. I hardly endured the two hours spent in the cinema hall, the only reason why I didn't get up to leave was to not disturb the other few spectators in the hall.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","mm-39","15 April 2023","The Pope's Exorcist is a mix of Chuck Norris meets the Exorcist! Well, The Pope's Exorcist starts out strong with the introduction of the Russel Crow character. There is the exorcist and a mix with Vatican politics. In Spain there is this Castel which is being renovated and Russel Crow is sent to investigate. Crow has humor, and understanding which creates a likeable character. The supporting actors creates interesting story development. Second half of The Pope's Exorcist becomes a mystery which turns into Raiders of the Lost Arch with history archeological find, fire balls, with a mix of the original exorcist. The end ties up with a new Vatican confronting the Devil trying to hide inside the church itself and the use of evil distraction. Well the message about evil, and the start make the movie watchable, but the end is over the top. 6 stars.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","pixrox1","29 June 2023",". . . the original GHOST-BUSTERS. A little comic relief proves vital in balancing out THE POPE'S EXORCIST's dark subject matter. As any literate theologian well knows, the Roman Sects Cult has posed a scourge to Humanity, Common Sense and the Social Order for many centuries. This flick pinpoints the time that the Vatican jumped the shark as 1475. A fallen angel dude named something like ""Abner"" usurped the papacy then, commanding the Inquisition, thousands of ""witch"" burning's, hundreds of wars, countless famines and plagues, as well as rampant sects abuse and billions of lies. As the Good Book predicts, ""Rome is the root of all Evil.""","7/10"

It has that large scale, somewhat epic feel, plus great cinematography and production values.

"The Pope's Exorcist","imseeg","1 January 2024","I had my trepidations watching another horror movie, since I have seen so many average or terrible ones lateley, but fortunately this one is a solidly made excorsist story with a lot of goodies and one lesser feature...The bad; let's start with what I found to be the least exciting feature and that was the use of special effects that were a bit underwhelming, AND they started using these special effects too soon into the story. Why too soon? Because what's most enoyable about this movie is...The good: solid slow buid up in suspense from start till finish, only let down by some silly over use of special effects, when it didnt need any. Why not? Because it's the CHARACTERS that are most important to this story and that's the way I like it!Especially Good: Russell Crowe Russell Crowe Russel Crowe. He nails his performance as a wise (and WITTY) excorsist priest. He truly is THE core of this movie. Terrific acting performance!NOT horryfiying, but suspenseful YES. NOT original, but enjoyable YES.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","PedroPires90","12 April 2023","Generic and full of genre clich√©s, the movie tries to be different by not taking itself too seriously. Sometimes it works, thanks to a badass Russell Crowe in the lead role, driving a scooter and drinking whiskey while he's exorcising demons. However, at times it goes overboard, with many elements that seem straight out of a Marvel movie, including some misplaced humor or underveloped characters.I liked the demon's visual, but I didn't like the acting of the assisting priest. However, the biggest flaw is that the story is boring, there's not much to hold our attention and the horror elements simply don't work, as it's never tense enough. Nice ""final battle"" though.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","JoshuaMercott","2 July 2023","My Impressions:When the Vatican's own leading exorcist found one of his 'cases' more challenging than most, serious demonic activity would, as expected, be unleashed.This movie was adapted from the real-life (as far as we know) experiences of Father Gabriele Amorth who served the Church from 1986 to 2016, in which year he died. Russell Crowe expertly portrayed him in ""The Pope's Exorcist"".Crowe soon became one of the main reasons I sat through the movie. His acting was empathic, engaging, funny, and powerful. Those portions of his performance in authentic Italian were amazing to watch.His character Gabriele's investigation into a possessed child, Henry Vasquez, led to scary sequences which evoked the performance of Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"" of 1973. But, alas, this one didn't meet that gold standard.The young boy (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) did notable work in the role, though. His character's sister and mother, Amy (Laurel Marsden) and Julia (Alex Essoe) Vasquez, respectively, gave great performances.Locations included Italy and Spain in the 80s, which added to the story's appeal. The attention to 80s-era detailing was nostalgic and impressive.The Vasquez family inherited San Sebastian Abbey (in Castile, Spain), which they wanted to restore in the hopes of earning an income by selling it later. Everything about the edifice - including the catacomb and cave (props and otherwise) beneath it - was an architectural delight.I liked how they introduced the possibility of a centuries-old conspiracy connected to the Spanish Inquisition and noted that it was later covered up by the Vatican. At the center of the plot was the 'king of hell' Asmodeus, considered to be one of the most dangerous of all demons, and a Fallen Angel besides.Next, the bold and open take on an exorcist's duties and their purpose, as evidenced by Gabriele Amorth in this movie, was as refreshing as it was riveting to see. Even though they relied a little too much on clich√© to communicate his work ethic, the story didn't suffer for it.""The Pope's Exorcist"" narrowly avoided pandering to religious Catholic sentiments. It also took into account real-world relevance. It made sure to address sexual abuse and psychological instability.Even the demon in question was a character in its own right and had its own motivation - to possess Father Gabriele Amorth, the titular Pope's exorcist, infiltrate the Church at the highest levels, and establish a deceptive direction in it.The concept of 2% of exorcism cases being inexplicable (to Science) and potentially 'evil' contained a good amount of credibility. By the time they revealed the exact identity of the demon (Asmodeus) that was dual-possessing Henry and Amy, all the dots that had accumulated so far in the plot had been diligently connected.Father Gabriele's negligence, pride, and past cowardice on the battlefield (when he served as a soldier in WWII) was a full-bodied human addition to the movie. Those haunting sequences, coupled with Russell Crowe's acting excellence, made ""The Pope's Exorcist"" fascinating to watch.The deceptive nature of demons and how they can potentially do evil in the name of god was a meaningful inclusion. It catered to Catholic sentiments, yes, but it was well within their spiritual context and culture. The notion even makes sense outside the Catholic framework.Given the dark nature of human souls, the idea of a demonic entity manipulating our weaknesses and 'sins' to serve its own agenda, including and especially infiltration and corruption, was not altogether impossible to believe. Great empires fall from within, after all. Planting this 'seed of doubt' in the viewer was, by itself, a stunning accomplishment in ""The Pope's Exorcist"".I did not think they would go so far as to actually let Asmodeus possess Gabriele, but they did. The finale was made doubly empowering because of that creative decision. Russell Crowe's all-too-human performance was praiseworthy and compelling.For the first time since I can remember, I saw Catholic priests in a movie owning their personal sins and shortcomings, using their faith to fight their inner demons - in this case, literally - and performing quite the shepherd's sacrifice to keep their flock safe.Good Lord, I pray there's a sequel. The movie's final scene more than hinted at one.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","daszemplinski","5 May 2023","Really thought this was going to a respectful movie about the work of Father Amorthe. He Seemed to be a good priest and devout Christian. This movie is a joke, Russel Crowe is a caricature of him. This is truly a horror flick along the lines of 80's-90's slasher, Freddy Krueger style. In fact that actually rip off a scene from the 1985 ish movie! Foul, ugly, banal, cliched boring. Had we not bout large beers we would have walked out. Apparently the majority of the budget was blown on Crowe's salary - because every other actor is bottom of the barrel. Fortunately, it was $5 Tuesday - and the large seats are like a bed.

He gives a very strong performance in this movie. This movie is as effective as it because Crowe grounds the story with a very honest performance. The movie delivers a bunch of scary/exciting moments. I wasn't expecting much, mainly because Crowe was in it, but I was really surprised. It's a cracker jack horror movie.

"The Pope's Exorcist","kjohn-77891","22 May 2023","I have been waiting to see this movie after I saw the first trailer. Of course like many people who saw the trailer would expect a scary, tight, dark movie in which you will be in the edge of your seat and scared to step away from the screen in case you miss something.But what you got was a campy, cgi effects (which don't work), non scary horror film.I must admit I was disappointed after this movie finished, yes I did enjoy it but it was not what I expected.Would I see another movie of the same character, yes I would as I enjoyed Russell Crowe as the main character and could see him playing this one for a few movies like the Insidious & Conjuring movie series.If they do, I hope they make it as a straight horror not the one we had hear.As my headlong says.

"The Pope's Exorcist","AvionPrince16","11 May 2023","I didnt enjoyed that much the movie but didnt hate it also but it really annoyed me sometimes and how the dialogues lead us to a superstitious thing and how they made theories about the devil, Jesus, the sins. The performance of the main actor is convincing even if im not a fan of that kind of comedy in these horror movies. The mood was there, the ambience too: i enjoyed the blue and orange tone and give an interesting visuals despite the classic plot and characters. So its basically a story about a priest who do his job and we will just get to know him better trough the new case with the old case about a woman who he didnt saved. What else to say? The special effects were good: the boy look convincing and the transformation can be seen much more later in the movie and was well executed. We have also the discussions with the church, the purpose, the religious thought and so on and so on. We have seen a lot of times that kind of topic with the exorcist theme. We have also some history about the house that the family who just moved in. And we know also the name of the devil at the end; it make him more weak; same thing over and over. So to resume that movie: its a classic horror movie with the exorcist theme with some talks who was a little bit too much superstitious for me and some exorcist and some rude language as always the devil is still rude and not really polite so yeah it can still make you know a story about the priest but it made me think that they took too much liberty in my opinion mostly at the end. But it is what is.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","stevelivesey-37183","5 May 2023","More like a 5.5.Russell Crowe has done better work and is clearly having fun here but I can't help but think he is a tad miscast.There way too much going on in this movie for it all to hang together well enough to make us feel much of anything. It's not particularly scary, it's not particularly original, the acting is hammy at best. No one has a serviceable character arc in the entire film including the badly written mother.And yet. It is quite fun. In spite of its weird casting choices, hokey script and copycat set pieces (up side down crosses, heads turning, possesions jumping from person to person) it is somewhat fun.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","henry8-3","6 July 2023","Russell Crowe plays Father Gabriele Amorth, exorcist to the Vatican - apparently man and role existed. The Pope himself (Franco Nero) commands Amorth to visit an old abbey in Spain where a young boy is possessed and advises that that the church have had issues there before. It is apparent from day one that the possession is real, but Amoth's investigations suggests there is more to this than meets the eye.Whilst 'The Exorcist' did this first and better and as such a lot of the possession stuff is pretty familiar, there is still a lot of fun to be had here. This is largely because of Crowe, who fills the screen with his performance and the glorious character he's come up with. The effects are impressive, it's intriguing and a little unsettling, if not really scary, but it's at its best when Amorth is in charge and fighting Satan with a smile on his face. A sequel is planned. Good fun.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","josephbrewster-88279","24 May 2023","If you like exorcism flicks or like horror or like Russell Crowe, see it. It's a well done, well acted, middlingly written, nicely filmed trip back a few decades with refreshingly relevant ideas packaged in moderately predictable structures.It's good. Not great, unless you count Crowe's performance, but good, dependable catholic horror, filled with enough action, tension and stuff flying around to void the ""slow burn"" category. It isn't incredibly scary, but doesn't try to have overly pretentious jump scares and sticks with on-screen violence and shock rock demon dialogue (demons say the darndest things).All the tropes are here, but done well. All the cliches are served up properly. Crowe shines on screen, like you'd expect, and the rest of the cast do well enough, although the kid's parts smell a bit stereotyped and overplayed at times. FX are solid, set is cool. What's not to love?This movie won't change the genre or win any awards, but it's good. It deserves a watch, so if you're reading this and you're on the fence, watch it.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","rossarntson","18 August 2023","Needs a little polishing if they want to make a grander impression on the US market. I like the duality of the church belief systems and how it has created its own political duopoly, thus creating a secondary tension between the characters.Even with a powerful performer as Russell Crowe, who knocked his character out of the park, the support characters needed more developing. This in turn, would give the audience cause to be rooting for them as well. A few parts seemed a bit disjointed as if added as an after thought, to support something that didn't need supporting.But all in all it was watchable and they left it open for a sequel... which I would watch.","7/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","dougzinboston","8 May 2023","I expected the formulaic priest/demon film and although the film maintains some of the standard fare, it's storyline, good cast and smooth flow keeps this film moving and entertaining. I was shocked when I realized I was 50 minutes into the film because the story flowed very well. I thought it was less time and I think it's because the film isn't all over the place all at once. It keeps its focus on telling the story and that made the film very enjoyable. Character introductions and set ups weren't over the top or too long. You knew who they were, what they were doing and where they fit in the film and the cast did an amazing job. A few scares here and there that all fit into the story and didn't take away from the film or feel gratuitous or cheesy. I'd watch this all over again.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","gianmarcoronconi","24 April 2023","OK, horror movie with a very basic plot that plays out a real-life character in a slightly exaggerated way. The film in general entertains a lot and even if it is very exaggerated and very banal it still entertains and manages to keep the spectator glued to the screen and this is always a good quality for a film. Point that I find negative, however, is the sequence of the Pope who is sick towards the end of the film with the parallel of our protagonist who discovers the real reasons for the possession and I also find the ending after the true ending a ridiculous thing left open to an almost ridicule of possible sequels.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","thealchemist-05132","2 October 2023","Pros:Russel Crowe is a good actor and good in this role.I m not sure where the movie is filmed, but the movie takes place in an old, run-down abbey in Spain; the setting is great.The script is decent but far from great. I'll list it in pros but it's the least pro thing I'm listing.Cons:A truly great feature, some movies have, is that they feel real. They feel like you're a fly on the wall watching real-life unfold; this movie feels like it was reaching for that but kept missing the mark.Conclusion:I think it's worth watching once, but only if you don't mind watching a movie that is just a little bit lackluster.Extra:At the end, it appears that there might be sequels made.

His character was unwavering under extreme duress initially until the realization of just how evil his demonic opponent was became apparent.

This should be expected during any better than average horror film, and this one delivered.If I have to make one complaint, and it's a minor one, there was quite a bit of captioning making certain that viewers had to pay close attention.I'm not big on horror films, but IMO this one was better than what some other viewers have reported.","1/10"

This film although may not be terrifying and have you jumping out your chair. It follows a great storyline and the mystery of the film as well as Russel Crowe's incredible acting will keep you well entertained.Synopsis:
Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth, Chief Exorcist of the Vatican (Academy Award¬Æ-winner Russell Crowe), The Pope's Exorcist follows Amorth as he investigates a young boy's terrifying possession and ends up uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden.","4/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","hstaunton","27 May 2023","Crowe is an exceptional actor however what a very very poor script, there was never a moment that you would consider it other than the folly it was! Very poor and not a horror movie but more of repetitive scenes of total garbage and an embarrassment to anyone with half a brain cell.I would steer clear of this dud and await the release of the remake of the original exorcist, which I'm sure will be far far superiorBut if you insist on wasting your time watching this, then grab some popcorn and revel in the nonsense and accept that these days even greats such as Russell Crowe need a pay check.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","meddlecore","7 May 2023","If you took Friedman's version of The Exorcist, dumbed it down, swapped all the practical effects for garbage CGI, and added a below average performance from Russel Crowe...you'd have The Pope's Exorcist.There's literally NOTHING original in this film.Most aspects are taken from the original Exorcist film, only done worse.The writing is for an audience of children.The plot structure is incredibly weak.The acting is mediocre at best.There's no twist.No originality.And it shamefully sets itself up for a sequel...as if anyone was asking for one.The whole thing reeks of laziness.And comes off as nothing more than a blatant cash grab.If I'd have actually paid money to see it, I'd be genuinely upset.I went into this hoping it would be cool.But it's nothing but cheap, trash.That's about as basic as it comes.If you really need to satiate your exorcist fix...just wait for the new installation of The Exorcist instead.Because this isn't worth the waste of time.4 out of 10.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Elvis-Del-Valle","10 September 2023","Based on one of Father Gabriele's cases, the film presents us with this priest on a dangerous mission that goes beyond anything seen before. The story even presents something linked to the ancient Spanish inquisition that suggests that even the Catholic church itself can be seduced by evil and carry out acts that defy Catholic ethics. Looking at it from that angle, it is clear that The Vatican itself has a dark past that it tries not to repeat, since that led a large part of humanity to turn its back on the faith as a consequence. What the film does is focus on the sins of the church itself and how the evil entity present can use that as a weapon. It really becomes a film with a fascinating premise, beyond being just another film about exorcisms. Furthermore, the evil entity proves to be a much greater threat unlike other demons seen in other exorcism films. Russell Crowe plays a priest who is quite charismatic, tragic and disturbed at the same time. A rather peculiar combination for a priest. What is also notable is the inclusion of veteran Franco Nero as The Pope and he has a fairly subtle participation that made it worthwhile for Franco Nero to return to the big screen. The digital effects become a bit obvious, but all those supernatural scenes that even become fantastical, give the film a very good flavor. There may have been some loose ends, but The Pope's Exorcist is really a good film that fulfills its purpose. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ethanbresnett","24 April 2023","In the same way that cinema goers appear to be suffering from superhero fatigue, I can't help but think that the horror genre is suffering from exorcism fatigue.There have been so many exorcism films and this one doesn't really stand out from the crowd. It treads over the same ground that dozens of films have covered before. Everything about it feels rather cliche and formulaic. There are some interesting elements to the story but they aren't really developed until the final act, and never really get going.Crowe is a strong lead, and rises to the often tongue in cheek script with ease. At times though the film treads a little too much into the camp arena and undercuts the tension.The setting feels too cliche to be scary and overall the tone is a bit disjointed to inject any true suspense into the piece.Ultimately this film is fine, but it just doesn't stand out at all. When the horror genre is pumping out kooky hits like Barbarian and genuinely creepy pieces like The Black Phone, it's hard for a film like this to find its place. If you want a quick cheap thrill, this will deliver, but it will almost instantly be forgotten.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Seraphion","4 May 2023","Just caught this on an online source, started the playback expecting it to at least bring about some of the horror side of exorcism movies. Quite frankly, I'd say this movie didn't scare me one bit. Plus the Russell Crowe depiction of the whiskey-drinking, joke-cracking exorcist, the least scare I expected going deeper into the movie. What I didn't expect to be wowed by is in fact how the movie depicts the relation between our own sin, guilt, God's forgiveness, acceptance of that forgiveness, and afterward claiming the power to banish the devil in God's name. It all adds up to the bible's description, sans the need to recognize the demon's name in order to banish it proper. Maybe I just forget the biblical reference, but I remember they did that too in the Conjuring.","2/10"

The boy who does a possession act is the the soul of the movie and His flawless performance is what the movie makes us glue. A future star is born for Hollywood...

"The Pope's Exorcist","andrewpetrouap","8 April 2023","A very poor film full of cringeworthy moments and ridiculous unintentionally funny themes and scenes.The sight of a huge portly Crowe confronting and chatting with a allegedly possessed tiny skinny kid, is stupidly hilarious: it tears a huge hole into any semblance of believability.The plot becomes a tedious, convoluted Dan Brown silly mess.Watching a very overweight Crowe use a very tiny mini scooter to supposedly move another massive weight is farcical. The movie is filled with such cringeworthy scenes which culminate in a crock of bad cgi ideas.Crowe's best scene is when he voraciously guzzles whiskey from a silver vial with all the gusto of a true alcoholic.","10/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","athanasiosze","29 August 2023","1) This is better than i expected, i agree with some reviewers here, but it could have been even better. Too much CGI, why? It should be less cartoonish. No need for all this pandemonium (no pun intended!). Demon would be more menacing if he talked less, in any case, not with that voice. I disagree with some reviewers here saying that it looks like a comedy/horror, no, it doesn't. However, it should be scarier. Less noise and style, more substance. If i was not a Christian, this would be no terrifying experience, for sure.2) Having said that, this is a very good horror movie, exciting at times. All the actors here do a good job, and Crowe is excellent. His Gabriele Amorth is one of the most interesting characters in horror movies. I didn't know anything about him. I read some things, as it seems, Crowe portrays him well. Ending was the best part of the movie.3) I don't know what is real and what is fiction here, but it seems realistic to me. Demon in this movie had a plan. Take a look at Vatican today. If there was a plan indeed, what do you think, did it fail or succeed? (Just kidding. Maybe)","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Inteshari","30 July 2023","This movie was top-notch. It wasn't a mindless horror flicks. There was depth to it. Stories that show that there is something deeper going on with everyone. Dialogue, the acting, the cinematography, everything was upto the mark.How our guilt makes us vulnerable, and if we accept our mistakes, learn from them, seek atonement, do the right thing, we become much much more powerful.The movie was critical of some practices of the Vatican but it was not an all out attack, which was refreshing to see.If you are a fan of mindless horror flicks, this movie is NOT for you. If you like deep, dark, thought-provoking psychological battles and the power of good over the evil, then you will love it.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","hildimre","9 April 2023","There were a couple of funny mistakes in this movie - Russell is sent to Spain by the pope, effective immediately. The next day, he arrives in super hilly Spain with his trusted scooter. Never mind the 1,800 km distance and the country of France which lays in between Italy and Spain. The same scooter was used as heavy machinery, when he moves a solid well-cover in rainy, muddy conditions.Also, the 'possessed' kid is tied down to the head of the bed, although he never even attempts to leave the bed for the entire movie....
Russel has a sense of guilt becuase in WWII he survives a Nazi ambush - all his comrades are killed but he makes it with a smear of blood in his forehead. Where is the guilt part in it?!The Pope vomits blood and seemingly recovers in no time - of what illness? If it is the work of the devil, why mess around with Russel 1,800 km away in the Spanish forest?By the way, the abbey - it sits in the middle of nowhere, yet electricity comes on and off as if it was attached to a city grid. No power supply station or anything.And last but not least - Russell tells the novice priest that saying a praying in Spanish is 'even better'. Should we tell it to everyone who doesn't speak Spanish?","7/10"

The story felt a little bit ""forced"". Kind of someone trying to excuse the inquisition. I would have enjoyed a little bit more back story from the family.The performance of the actors were good, mostly the kid. For some one his age I think he did a great job.

"The Pope's Exorcist","cj70","7 May 2023","As if we haven't seen enough terrible exorcist movies since the original and unsurpassable The Exorcist.This movie damns the whole canon of terrible exorcist movies with one cliche after another. The deep raspy voice of a man as the voice of a demon coming out of a child. Staying in a spooky old house and repeatedly staying there or going back into the room where the boy is possessed. Approaching the possessed child when you know it's going to attack. Flames, people flying about. Every cliche in the book is trotted out to torment the viewer.Are there any positives to this movie? Sadly not. Russell Crowe gives us a modified version of his character Zeus, from the god awful Love & Thunder, only with a more Italian flavour. And frankly, since doing any notable acting turn, he seems happy to turn up in any old movie, do his schtik, and get a pay cheque.The other characters are very forgettable and it's nice to know this movie will forever remain a stain on their CV.If you want to watch a good movie with fine acting just watch The Whale.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","DBlackthorne","19 August 2023","The Catholic Church crumbles beneath its own hypocrisy. Plus the secret sins of the two priests assigned to 'exorcise' /Asmodeus\ from a boy recently come to live in a Spanish Castle with his sister and mother.The slanted biopic features the story based on preeminent exorcist Fr. Gabriele Amorth, and assistant Esquibel, who harbor a plethora of transgressions, exploited by the devil.Description and location really gives the impression that it is actually Trasmoz, the only place designated by the roman church to preserve witches & warlocks - the utterly damned who cannot be saved, nor wish to be. This is due to the notion of the macrocosm & microcosm. Heaven, world, Hell, dualistically reflected upon the mortal plain as it is ethereally. So if the so-called ""holy see"" is reflective of 'heaven', Trasmoz is Hell on earth.For a possession movie, the demon appropriately proves extremely powerful, revealing holy lies left and right, allowing him ingress, and the multiplication of nightmare materialization, according to subject. Thus, a shadowmantic dynamic.Again, the host was set to expire, and thus departed to fresh flesh elsewhere. Despite their efforts, ultimately results in failure as the demonic influence proves too pervasive worldwide. And thus the subsequent increased implementation of exorcism initiatives.The film is intense, with fantastic effects and great writing, acting. Of note, She Sells Sanctuary by The Cult in the soundtrack.","7/10"

"The Pope's Exorcist","faranak-tiba","9 May 2023","In this movie, viewers will find themselves sorely disappointed by the complete absence of anything fresh or groundbreaking. Rather than pushing the boundaries of storytelling and artistry, it opts to be a mere imitation of other films, displaying a conspicuous lack of creativity and originality. What's even more disheartening is the wasted opportunity to create something truly remarkable, especially when there is so much talent and potential within the film industry.It's a tremendous shame to see filmmakers resorting to recycling old ideas and concepts rather than investing their energy into crafting unique and captivating stories. This approach not only does a disservice to the audience but also stifles the growth and evolution of the industry as a whole.One can't help but question the motivation and rationale behind making this movie in the first place. Was it purely for financial gain, or was there a misguided belief that the formulaic approach would somehow resonate with audiences? Regardless, the end result is a film that leaves viewers feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied.In an era where there is an increasing demand for original, thought-provoking content, it is both perplexing and frustrating to see movies like this being made. Audiences crave innovative narratives and rich, complex characters, and it is the responsibility of filmmakers to rise to the challenge and deliver on these expectations.Unfortunately, this movie falls woefully short of the mark, offering little more than a hollow, uninspired rehash of what has come before. It serves as a stark reminder that, in order to push the boundaries of cinema and create truly memorable experiences, filmmakers must embrace originality and take risks, rather than settling for the safety and predictability of the tried-and-tested formula.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","kmkevinn-64733","18 April 2023","Great cinematography, solid acting, at times more amusing than frightening. Plot was highly suspenseful, if not cliched. But it doesn't really go deep enough into exploring the castle's origins or history. The foolhardy protagonists must've had massive balls to keep coming back for more like they did. Just nothing seemed to phase the exorcist or his sidekick priest, as long as they could recite some holy prayer.The faith that they all embodied to save the boy was the underlying message. It raised a point that if there were no such evil, perhaps in the form of the devil Himself, then what really is the purpose of churches and religion?! This catalyses the underlying allusion to the shadow side or id during their momentary disarrays, among suppressed confessions.Worth watching as there isn't a dull moment - best enjoyed as a cinematic horror movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. In terms of screenplay, think indiana jones meets the exorcist with a hint of scary movie, but without the corniness (it's not 18+ rated after all).I suppose the exorcist's suaveness all throughout was accounted for when he finally took a valiant swig of drink from his vial at the end. Oh and the many books he authored as Amaroth were rather good indeed... as in good versus evil!","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Stanlee107","28 May 2023","Remember that Bananarama song #Robert de niro talking Italian # probably not. This is Russell Crowe speaking Italian.His name bought me to watching this film. I have seen more than my share of average or even below average exorcism films. I did not expect much from it but came in watching it with an open mind.This is a serious film that somehow managed to steer away from the pitfalls where all other wannabe films have failed. It is not generic with lazy writing and predictable endings. The writing is considerably better than most that have tried and failed.Russell Crowe (Father Gabriel Amorth) is the front end centre of all that is great about this film. He is charismatic & brings a warmth believable pope character that is in possession of devine expertise with an injection of humour. The supporting cast are all decent. The possession scenes and the storyline are done expertly. You can tell that particular care was taken to ensure this film will succeed where others failed.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","schmidtp-54221","14 January 2024","I wasn't really too sure what to expect from this movie. I wouldn't say I'm generally a fan of movies with Russell Crowe in them, but I did enjoy this movie.It's a good take on the whole demon possession theme, with some homage to the original Exorcist film. The story centres around a family that moves to an old Abbey they've inherited from their deceased husband/father. While renovations are going on, an old kl buried secret is revealed. The young boy gets possessed and it's up to the popes exorcist (Russell Crowe) to help the boy and banish the demon.Along the way, the exorcist reveals the reason behind the demonic possession and the dark history of the former Abbey.Maybe not as scary as the original but there's some good special effects, a little bit of humour added in with a few jump scares.

"The Pope's Exorcist","atklein-90191","16 September 2023","An artless, rushed outing that tries to combine elements of Davinci Code with The Exorcist.As someone else mentioned, it's hard to know whether we are supposed to take this seriously or treat it as the cheap parody it actually is. If movies were a checklist, this one manages to check off all the generic beats of an exorcism flick. But it rushes through the setup and setting, introduces virtually zero original concepts, and leaves you without any feeling of urgency or concern for the characters. Performances are either entirely flat or cranked up to 11 (out of 10), likely due to lack of context from the contrived script.Perhaps most egregious is how this movie attempts to skate by, appealing to our collective fondness and familiarity with Friedkin's infinitely superior Exorcist film. Don't be fooled. Any commonality between the two begins and ends with the title.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Mike_Devine","10 September 2023","By 2023, the ""priest investigates allegedly possessed person and attempts to save them"" plot has been done to death, going all the way back to the 1973 original that started it all. Therefore, it's not surprising that 'The Pope's Exorcist' is a mediocre-at-best telling of yet another spooky case that needs solving.There's no denying Russell Crowe's starring role here makes 'Exorcist' worth a watch, as the actor's storied career is more than enough evidence that he can bring it. In his portrayal of the no-nonsense, flask-carrying Father Amorth, he brings a sense of gravitas that sets him apart from others who've carried this torch in past films (and he is a foil to Daniel Zovatto's inexperienced Father Esquibel). But as we've seen time and again, acting can only take a film so far.While 'Exorcist' has its fair share of jump scares and ""shock and awe"" moments as the two priests try to aid a widow and her children who just inherited a troubled Spanish abbey (worst lottery ever), it feels very ""retread"" for the most part. Yes, the setting is creepy and intriguing...at least, more so than the typical suburban house where these movies take place. But there are shades of less tolerable films here, including 'The Nun,' that make it feel like we've been here and done this. There is a twist that history buffs may find interesting, and the tie-in with the politics of the Vatican isn't ordinary, but the execution of the screenplay leaves much to be desired.It's fine to give this 'Exorcist' a try, but don't expect any real out-of-body experiences.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","silicontourist","9 June 2023","Many people will agree that we will probably never, ever, see a terrifying hell hound of a film as good as the bitch that started it all back in in 1973. THE EXORCIST. It and the film from 1982, 'The ENTITY' are still the two most scary films I have ever seen; because they are based upon facts. Modern schlock horror does not compare.I can only explain it as it is in the title for this review. Any more and I would be giving the good away. It is a surprise to see Russell Crowe as a priest but he is excellent in the role. The people who say that 'its just the same old type of Exorcism style film' are unequivocally wrong! There has never been a scripted story that was not about the beast just causing havoc to innocents on Earth. This one was original in that possession of great length would kill the currently possessed and, the beast was was there for payback on the Russell Crowe priest character; who has been a successful Exorcist for 20-30 years., But more importantly it was there to bring down its revenge upon the Vatican! Its tense, its scary, it superbly acted and it ticks most of the boxes that makes for a good film!","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","davidgee","28 April 2023","This is a lot less schlocky than I expected. The demonic possession we see here, a small boy in Spain, brings unavoidable echoes of Linda Blair's Regan in the 1973 movie. The demon speaks in a guttural voice. The boy levitates and also hurls people across the room by pure mental power. Writing appears on his skin.But despite the recycling there are many genuinely goose-bumpy moments. The boy (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) is believably desperate. Russell Crowe and his young sidekick (Daniel Zovatto) give measured performances, not too shouty. Franco Nero as the Pope is still a commanding screen presence at 81.The last quarter of the film goes into CGI overdrive, bringing THE MUMMY remakes to mind, but even if the ground is a bit familiar, this is an exciting and entertaining way to revisit it.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","rapiddevil","13 April 2023","Let's get the basics out of the way. These exorcism movies have been done to death. It's pretty much impossible to be original with this niche genre.However....as far as they go it was pretty good! The best I've seen for a while.Russell was good, apart from sounding more like a Serbian veteran than Italian.Was it scary? Not really. There were times when we were laughing at it rather then be scared. They made a valiant effort at adding a Da Vini Code style of plot so that it wasn't a rinse and repeat of other similar movies.There were pretty good effects on the possessed one. Good acting all around, which is rare for this type of movie!Overall I thought it was a good attempt. Everything was done reasonably well without anything being outstanding. If they wanted to take it to another level I feel there could have been more shock/scare moments that genuinely wanted you to grab a cushion to hide behind. But that's subjective on my part.Worth a watch!","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Screen_O_Genic","13 May 2023","One of the best and most gripping Horror flicks of recent years, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" is highly-charged drama on the deepest and most fundamental realities and truths of existence. Gabriele Amorth is the chief exorcist of the Vatican and highly regarded at what he does. Independent and cavalier with his superiors he has his brushes with the authorities. When a young boy is possessed in Spain he is sent to help the child and what he faces is more than he expects and will unearth all the complexities of his life which he will have to face and surmount in order to accomplish his mission. Good direction, acting, pacing, cinematography, special effects and music fuel this edge of your seat thriller. Russell Crowe is a natural in the lead role with his burly and flippant demeanor and the supporting cast adequately help carry the film through. Although the clich√©d scenes that usually accompany these films are in full display and the typical pc tinge tags along as usual the power and message of the film washes off the cack like holy water on undesirables. A primal and profound examination on good and evil, life and God, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" reminds us of life's purpose and the one, the only one, we can trust to help us get through and the only one who matters.","5/10"

And its more subtle in terms of shock treatment you see in other horror films like Conjuring. Also it runs on a very thin storyline, and quit funny towards the end, the reasoning of all that is happening is quit funny and flimsy. I expected something on the lines of The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. But it isn't. That movie was a marvel. It is not a BAD movie, but it doesnt leave any impact on you, once you leave the theatre.

"The Pope's Exorcist","sarahchauvidon","21 August 2023","I ended up watching this in Amazon, as I never got to cinema to see it. It was a little bit different, Russel Crowe's character, the priest who carries out the exorcisms had a sense of humour, much to the disgust if those above him. It was the usual trope, child becomes possessed and needs an exorcism. However, the young boy that is the victim is just not scarey, he doesn't make you jump or do anything remarkable. Even the accent the demon possessing the child has a British northernish/cockney accent and it just isn't scarey it's sort of amusing. This character was mis cast and needs some work. So was disappointed.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","mqwbqmj","8 April 2023","Everything from the script to the exact phrases to the characters and even the setting is the exact same as every other Vatican exorcist movie ever created... This is basically ""THE RITE"" mixed with a little conjuring the devil made me do it. Absolutely nothing new under the sun. I can agree Having Russel Crowe play the exorcist was great but Anthony Hopkins already nailed that role and he did it better than Crowe could. By default this can only get a 5 because you're watching the same exact thing over again. Mocking God ""what's you name?!"" ""Don't address the demon directly"" ""Pray"" ""Unclean Spirit"" I mean it's all there and all the exact same... The movie takes place in an Abby which screams ""The Nun."" With all that said it's worth a watch because it's funny at times and it is a horror movie about exorcism. If you're a horro fan like I am (especially when the Vatican is involved) then it's certainly worth a watch but to rate it more then 5 stars is ridiculous.","4/10"

It was great.However, I don't think there was anything here that we hadn't seen in other excorcist movies and I think that's where this movie lets me down. The story was ok, the acting was ok, the cinematography was ok but it was too long with very little happening, I wanted something more. It didn't have the depth that a movie like The Conjuring had and maybe it had to do with the kids. The little boy just looked too innocent to pull off a mean looking demon, the girl child was too annoying for me to care what happened to her and the mother just didn't push herself hard enough. Also I felt that their memories were too weak and uncreative.All that being said, I believe that this will be loved greatly by all Catholics and conservative Christians even though there are some curses, some alcohol and cigarette consumption and some boobs. Overlook all these and you will have a faith based movie that will make any Christian proud.Judging by how it ended, I believe this will be turned into some sort of a franchise. Are we about to have our first Priest Superhero Action Movie? That will be dope.","6/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Otkon","3 May 2023","The grizzled protagonist that no one trusts, His young and therefore na√Øve assistant. The foul-mouthed, gravelly-voiced possessed. Everyone acting with faces like they are constipated. A by-the-numbers threadbare plot. The cardinal ripoff of head-twisting. Throwaway characters. Tired CGI effects. An ending that setups up a sequel or even a TV series.I enjoyed Russell Crowe lumbering around like Baloo the Bear and being goofy - supposedly like the real-life priest this was based on. And three of the four songs on the soundtrack were stellar. Shame they were not used in a more interesting, less corny movie.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","coreshibin","14 May 2023","Watched the movie hoping to see some horror but instead it was less horror and more plot driven, the plot was good though it will keep you interested in the movie. The trailer made it seem more terrifying but the actual movie.... Meh, can't really consider this a horror but maybe as a thriller movie, if your a horror movie fan hoping to see some jumpscares and horror might as well watch another movie, if your just a movie fan interested on watching the movie due to the curiosity given by the trailer ""the Vatican is hiding something"" then definitely watch this movie it won't disappoint you at all.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","Jack_B_Nimble","10 May 2023","Greetings movie enthusiasts. First a disclaimer. I don't believe in demonic possession, not even a little bit. I've seen videos that claim to show actual exorcisms and I remain unconvinced. I didn't enjoy the original Exorcist or the subsequent sequels. I consider projectile vomiting silly and made all the more so by James Wood's hilarious sendup of the original as Father McFeely in Scary Movie 2. Worst of all is the very real possibility that, due to demonic possession films, real life children with Tourette's, or Epilepsy, or ADHD might be subjected to the trauma of an actual exorcism. It can happen.However, much to my surprise, The Pope's Exorcist worked for me. I was drawn into its odd, dark and bewitching world. Russell Crowe was great as always. He brought warmth and humor to the role of Father Gabriel Amorth. Whether you're Catholic or not he's the sort of priest you'd like to sit next to at a dinner party.Peter DeSouza-Feighoney was perfect and terrifying as the possessed boy. No, his head didn't spin around three hundred and sixty degrees. He didn't have caked on makeup an inch thick and, I'm happy to report, he didn't misuse a cross. He didn't need to resort to such cheap tricks to be spine-chillingly nightmarish.The most spellbinding parts of the film were the conversations between Crowe and the boy, but those moments were far too brief. Imagine that you're a priest, or not a priest, and fate has cast you the opportunity to speak with an actual demon. You're conversing with an unholy and supernatural being, something not of this Earth, a creature of darkness and sin.Wouldn't you be tempted to ask the demon about his existence, his views on freewill, his views on morality and on God? Was he created depraved or was he once pure and now fallen. And if fallen why? The mind boggles at the possibilities but this movie doesn't address those issues.In the extended cut of The Neverending Story Atreyu didn't ask the G'mork his name. There was no need for that. The boy already knew it. Instead Atreyu asked his antagonist, ""Who are you really and what makes you so wicked?"" Those are the very questions that Crowe should've asked the demon who inhabited the boy. I'd like to know the answers.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","MattTB87","6 May 2023","First up, massive respect for the makers of this to not have a single jump scare in the entire film. That should show you what we're dealing with here; Action thriller, rather than horror.There are of course horror elements, but this is more akin to Constantine or The Last Witch Hunter, an overly serious but totally solid 6/10 action film with both too much and too little exposition.Crowe gives a decent performance, as does the kid, he's like a de-aged Andy Serkis and honestly is great, but again, let me remind you, this is not a horror film in any way and honestly, it should never have been marketed as that. Because as an action thriller, it's perfectly fine.7/10 - would action thriller again.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","hanianuar","1 June 2023","Coming from someone who's easily scared, it wasn't scary at all. Best they tried were the loud jumpscares and even those were predictable. The consistently criminal lightning n rain effects throughout the movie threw me off tbh üò≠. Also the kids demon voice is just silly. The start was very cliche, an american orphaned family moves into an inherited haunted mansion and starts getting possessed. Other than that, the Storyline wasn't too bad imo.. maybe if they were executed well enough i wouldnt be so critical (the acting was noticeably bad). I dont know how they imagined to appeal to the audience but i was not scared, not interested, not emotionally invoked, and not laughed (although there were a few poor attempts)...","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","comps-784-38265","24 April 2023","This is the first semi-decent horror i've seen in some time.It's a solid workmanlike exorcism and demons plot with plenty of prayers and chanting. There is a view nods to predecessor films without being too cheesy or going over the top in gore. .Throw in the charisma and presence of Russell Crowe (on a Vespa) and he really brings 'The Pope's Exorcist' up another full notch or two on quality, and even throws in a pinch of comedy.Worth the price of a cinema ticket ? YesWould I watch this again? Possibly for a sunday matinee, yes.Without Crowes presence I would have said this film is 6 or 6.5/10 but his presence definitely raises it another full point.","2/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ce971665","2 June 2023","I must begin this review by stating that I am not accustomed to sharing my opinions on movies, but I am compelled to make an exception for this particular film, which undoubtedly deserves the ignoble title of the worst movie of the year. From start to finish, it is a train wreck of catastrophic proportions, with abysmal acting, an incoherent plot, lackluster writing, amateurish directing, a feeble story, and laughable CGI effects.To call this production a movie would be an insult. It feels more like an uninspired rehearsal or a half-hearted attempt at creating a coherent narrative. There is an utter lack of suspense-building throughout, and the absence of any truly frightening or amusing moments leaves the audience perplexed and unengaged. Scene after scene, the film descends into a pit of laughable, disjointed mediocrity.Even the presence of Russell Crowe fails to salvage anything from this movie.My advice to anyone considering watching this film is to save your precious time and seek entertainment elsewhere.","8/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","CineviewUK","5 June 2023","Well Rusty hasn't lost any weight, in fact it looks like he's added some (for this role?!). I guess he had to give up fighting, but on the other hand I did enjoy him speaking Italian for some of his dialogue which was impressive.I struggle though to not draw immediate and glaring similarities between this movie and William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist) (1973). As soon as the kid Henry appeared in the first shot I knew it was him who would be possessed. The kid actor did a good job by the way.However overall it does lack the feness, tension and outright fear that Blatty's movie drew from it's viewer. Great sets and cinematography unfortunately doesn't help this movie as it doesn't offer anything new or original to the subject material at hand. You kind of feel like you've seen it all before.I watched it, but won't ever be seeking out a second viewing.","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","MJB784","26 April 2023","I loved that they flipped the exorcism genre around and provided us with new ideas. Most of them have a teenage girl possessed, but this had two characters and then the exorcist towards the end. Also, it takes place in a mansion bought by the father who died in a car accident. The family being dysfunctional and the exorcist having a sense of humor haven't been in a possession movie I've seen. Nor do I recall one where a young boy is possessed by the devil and can bring back evil memories of failed exorcisms to the title character. The movie doesn't explain why the father had the mansion in his will though. Me and a friend of mine were quite scared.","5/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","gpwdxrfv","18 November 2023","This is a good movie, good performances, sets, atmosphere but you can't escape that it's quite clearly The Exorcist with a gender change.Some of the dialogue is the same, the words under the skin, the two priests, the sexuality...obviously the genre only has so many things to work with and it's not too say this is a bad film because of that but at times I felt like I'd seen it before.The rest of the family being 'attacked' is a different spin, the professional telling the younger priest not to listen to speak with the demon was written by William Blatty.All that said I enjoyed it, but the original will always be one of my favourite films ever.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","khalidmoubile","13 August 2023","The Pope's Exorcist.Follow Gabriele Amorth, the Vatican's leading exorcist, as he investigates the possession of a child and uncovers a conspiracy the Vatican has tried to keep secret.First of all, watching this movie was almost a coincidence, it wasn't planned at all and suggested by a cousin to watch it together at the same exact moment.This movie is an average exorcist movie, a typical story expect of Russell Crowe being an Italian pope, yes it is a typical one nothing really was that special but at least it got me interested until the end.I believe that Russell was the best thing about this movie and without him this movie wouldn't hold-up together but unfortunately he couldn't do much about the movie itself, it's still not good enough , does it worth your time ?Not really, but if you're with a company and your curios how Russell Crowe looks like in this movie, go for it.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","AlchemicalFilms","7 April 2023","I'll come out and say it, The Popes Exorcist is difficult to like. The movie replays a lot of the tropes of exorcism/possession movies and it feels tired. Low gravel demonic voices? Check. People flying across the room? Check. Bodies misshapen? Check. It's all been done to death and there is nothing worth your time here.I got so bored that the question of ""why is Satan always bed ridden if he is so powerful?"" popped up. Perhaps this would be been more interesting?I digress...The good parts of the movie are the characterization of Father Gabriele Amorth and the conversations with the Pope. The theological debate piqued my interest, as did the council questioning Amorth's methods, but it was all too brief. The scenes within the underground chamber had promise, but then it went all Hollywood and ""the power of Christ compels you"" for the ending.We need to see something different with possession movies. As a filmmaker and writer, lazy scripts offend me. The film is presented reasonably enough but it just doesn't scare me, or make me want to see it again. The writing wheels out trope after trope and it could be a good drinking game.If I was being harsh, I'd say the movie is so bad that it is proof God doesn't exist. No benevolent force would allow it!","7/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","hea_andw","27 July 2023","Not even Crowe can save this piece of rot ... yet another millennial / Gen Alpha ""horror"" - MEGAN, The Invisible Man remake - where those generations , Jordan Peele films haven't seen the originals such as The Exorcist ... heaven help us if this is where ""horror"" is headed (yet we get spectacular films such as (the first 2.only) Halloween films (not ""Ends""), the 2 IT films and a few others).This even went so far as to (poorly) recreate the ""spider walk"" scene, albeit in the most pathetic way; the ""possessed"" kid doesn't come close to Regan; and it even attempts elements of Constantine badly.","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","HafizhMaulana21","9 October 2023","Based on the true story of Gabriele Amorth, a prominent Vatican priest who became the Vatican's Chief Exorcist. Father Gabriele Amorth is now handling and investigating the possession of a young boy amid the emergence of a conspiracy kept secret by the Vatican.Based on a true story, The Pope's Exorcist is one of the religious-themed horrors that is quite dark. Presenting the story of a priest who is famous for exorcism to his congregation, The Pope's Exorcist is enough to give a terrifying atmosphere in it. There are not many horror elements like in other horror films, but it is enough to provide tension and horror. The Pope's Exorcist for me wasn't very impressive and didn't feel enthusiastic in watching it in its entirety. The conflict of the story that for me does not appear convincing and too many scenes are over-dramatized. Likewise, there are many conflicts that become plot holes in it so that it becomes one of the less interesting pieces of the story. The conspiracies presented are also not very good so that overall this film feels responsible to have two conflicts. Overall, The Pope's Exorcist was quite good with Russell Crowe's performance which for me was quite slick.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","craigpb1976","7 April 2023","I'm not going to delve into this film, as there is nothing to delve into.Russell Crowe is in it, it couldn't be that bad, right? Wrong. This film is extremely bad, if it wasn't meant to be comical, or funny in some satirical way, then it's worse than I thought.One of the main problems is caring about literally anyone in it, I didn't, and I wouldn't know how you could.The biggest and I do mean biggest irritation is the possessed demonic voice over they gave the boy. Now as soon as I heard it, I wanted to laugh. It's corny, it's silly and it sounded like Rhys Ifans. There was nothing, and I do mean nothing, scary or creepy about any of the film. So if it was aiming for say, Sami Rammi territory, it fell way way short.I can't give any redeeming comments, I wanted it to be over half way through, and watching Crowe was painful, he was lost in a mire of plotless, badly written pulp.","9/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","mikan2040","9 May 2023","Firstly, unless you believe in reincarnation or are happy to waste the one life we have on this earth....spend it better than watching this film. So where to start with this? It starts off as a generic, if weak, story about an Exorcist doing well Exorcist stuff. There isnt too much too it there isnt anything new that we havent seen in a hundred other films. A family is introduced as they move to Spain. You could easily be forgiven for thinking that as these are the victims of a demon they would be fleshed out as characters...you know so you give AF when something happens to them. Well in this case you would be wrong. The family are merely vessels for the story...I mean demon to happen. What happens in the next hour and a bit is a downward trek towards utter garbage. While the synopsis may not sound too bad...believe me when I say it is atrocious. I'm not going to go into more details as I'm not a critic and this movie has taken too much of my life already. There are zero pay offs and dont expect any jeopardy.","1/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","ronterry55","19 April 2023","I love exorcist movies! I went to The Pope's Exorcist because Russell Crowe stars, and is based on an actual papal exorcist. This movie, and Russell, did not disappoint. It is a well done exorcist movie. Russell Crowe was terrific as the priest who was the Pope's Exorcist. It was lovely to see Franco Nero onscreen again as the Pope. The entire cast was wonderful. It was a decent script about a demon from the time of the Spanish Inquisition. I enjoy these movies depicting religious folk fighting against evil, especially when it relates back 500 years
The special effects and CGI were perfect. There were a few jump scares throughout the movie.It is a well done horror movie . The ending seems to set up for a sequel. I would enjoy that!","3/10"
"The Pope's Exorcist","buzzgary-61934","15 April 2023","A movie about historic religious ignorance to epilepsy and psychosis.While epileptic seizures may resemble possession they aren't due to anything supernatural.Same goes for psychosis. It's another medical condition in which hallucinations and delusional thinking are taking for reality.Sad that there is no mention of this in any other review.Exorcisms are often attributed to religious or spiritual beliefs and practices aimed at expelling evil spirits or demons from a person's body, mind, or soul. While some people believe that exorcisms can cure a range of physical, mental, or spiritual ailments, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.In many cases, the symptoms of supposed possession may actually be due to underlying medical or psychological conditions, such as epilepsy or psychosis. These conditions can cause a range of symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and altered states of consciousness, which may be interpreted as signs of possession by some.It is important to note that medical and psychological conditions require proper diagnosis and treatment by qualified healthcare professionals, and that exorcisms are not a substitute for medical or psychological care. In fact, attempting to treat these conditions through exorcisms or other non-evidence-based practices can be harmful and may delay or prevent effective treatment.While religious or spiritual beliefs are a personal matter, it is important to seek evidence-based medical and psychological care for any health concerns, including those that may be attributed to possession or spiritual causes.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","MiroslavKyuranov","31 May 2023","It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","UniqueParticle","2 June 2023","The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world!

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","pugpool10","2 June 2023","If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","rickothan","2 June 2023","This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","cricketbat","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","hectorvernet","31 May 2023","First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Sleepin_Dragon","11 June 2023","It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","nickryan-44535","6 June 2023","Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","DeadMansTrousers","14 June 2023","I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","planktonrules","21 June 2023","""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" currently has an astounding overall rating of 9.0. Like many other incredibly high ranked movies, I'm sure over time the score will drop but given it's so high now, I cannot imagine it leveling off below 8.0...meaning it's one of the best rated movies of all time. Well, while it might be a great crowd-pleaser, I am writing a dissenting review....and if you are like me, you might not be as bowled over as most reviewers.To put things in perspective, I am 59 years-old and certainly NOT in the target audience....so keep this in mind. While I like an occasional superhero film, I also don't adore them...but I did think the previous Spider-Man film, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"" was one of the best of its genre. In fact, I gave it a 10...I was that impressed with its originality and story and animation. So why was I left colder by its sequel? Well, there are several reasons. First, if you are like me and not all that familiar with Spider-Man, you'll probably find much of the story confusing...unlike the previous film. Second, the artwork, while very original, made my brain hurt! It was LOUD and BRASH and really awful...at least to me. The worst part was that the backgrounds actually looked like I was watching a 3-D movie WITHOUT 3-D glasses! Uggh...it was an assault on my eyes. And, third, I hated how the film ended with no plot resolution whatsoever....none.So does all this mean I hated the film? No. I laughed quite a few times...and mostly when it introduced other alternate universe Spider-creatures (many are women or animals...not just Spider-MEN). I also thought the basic story, once you strip away the horribly fast edits and garish artwork, was very interesting. Overall, not a bad film but I just did not particularly enjoy it nor do I particularly need to see the third and final film in the series.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","JayWolfgramm","11 June 2023","I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","rgkarim","2 June 2023","LIKES:The Pace For The Most Part
-Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.The Voice Acting
-Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.The Storytelling
-There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.The Comedy To A degree
-I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs
-Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.The Action Scenes
-A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.The Animation/Art Style
-You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.DISLIKES:The Comedy A Bit Too Forced
-There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.Some Pacing Offsets
-There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.-At least until the need.The Ending 20 minutes for me
-The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.The Sound Quality With Some Characters
-It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.The VERDICT:
Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","sfarrow8","2 June 2023","I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :THE ARTWORK.This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","penelopemmorris","8 June 2023","I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jenkinscammy","7 June 2023","Takes itself way too seriously, and fails to tell a compelling story.The writers apparently tried to re-use the formula for the first Spider-Verse movie, at the expense of character growth.This movie has a cliff-hanger ending, meaning that it's really just half of a movie. It hurts the pacing.The action is very predictable, but at the same time, the story is unnecessarily complicated. There's never any fear that any of the main characters are in danger.Overall, it's missing the wholesome, lighthearted moments which were so endearing in the first movie. This is a good movie to skip in the theaters and catch on streaming/DVD.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","gabethedinosaur","2 June 2023","It was absolutely awesome. I felt like I was traveling from the multiverse to my childhood back in 2002 when I saw Tobey maguire Spider-Man 21 years ago when I was 7 years old. And seeing all the other spider people including Spider-cat and Spider-rex . The spot traveling to venoms universe was absolutely hilarious. I hope to see ultimate Spider-Man from the video game I never finished on GameCube or Xbox for almost 17 years since I was a kid. Seeing 2018 Spider-Man from the PS4 game was very outstanding. I hope in Spider-Man beyond the spiderverse meets Tobey maguire and miles teams up with him and he helps him build the device and Gwen meets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and they help build the same device to bring miles home .","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","FeastMode","2 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete. Instead of exciting escalation to a beastly climax, in the last half hour we get setup.(2 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 6/1/2023, UltraScreen 6/7/2023)","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Tired_Reviewer","31 May 2023","The 5 years was worth the wait. Amazing animation, beautiful characters with rich backstories, the fights are amazing, Gwen's story is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING! This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.This isn't your run of the mill kids move, action movie, animated movie. It's a masterpiece that all ages can enjoy. An amazing sequel that sets extremely high hopes for the third movie.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","daralad","18 June 2023","I loved into the spiderverse, it had great animation, great characters, great plot development and great music. There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","pressboard","15 June 2023","I generally liked the animation but it constantly reminded me of trying to watch a 3D movie without the 3D glasses. The petty drama is endless and becomes old fast. There are loads of action scenes that immediately devolve into slow soap opera drama. My wife and I kept nodding off during these whine-a-thones which seemed very contrived. I did like all of the iterations of spider flavors in the Spiderverse which were endlessly creative and entertaining. The music always suggests exciting action scenes but this becomes a little exhausting after the 4th or 5th wind up. Long winded exposition seems necessary to spoon feed a very lengthy and convoluted plot. When I booked I noticed the theater was sold out but we left before the end and noticed that only 10 members of the audience still remained having left before us. Spot was a good albeit comedic villain. I would suggest going just for the animation and humor even with the 140min run time.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","TheBigSick","10 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel to the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The film is plagued by pacing issues, a reliance on clich√©s, and a lack of focus.The film's biggest problem is its length. At two hours and twenty minutes, it feels like two movies crammed into one. The first half of the film is slow and meandering, with too many subplots that don't really go anywhere. The second half of the film is much better, but it still feels rushed.Another issue with the film is its reliance on clich√©s. The theme of family is particularly overused, and it doesn't really add anything new to the story. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling too short.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","srdjankostic91","31 May 2023","I rarely write reviews, but this movie is truly exceptional. It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.The story is exceptionally well-crafted, expanding upon the existing characters while introducing new ones and incorporating intriguing twists. The humor throughout the film is spot-on, providing moments of levity without undermining the emotional depth of the narrative.Just go and see it!","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","matris1","3 June 2023","The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respects and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (hard to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.Should you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man (both on and off screen) while offering something new. It's also just a brilliantly made animated film. Highly recommended.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","georgetbarber","2 June 2023","Adjusted rating - 8.5/10: a genuine spectacle, you could take thousands of shots from this movie and turn them into posters, it's beautiful to look at. I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.Real rating - 7/10: it's half a movie man!! It's a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don't get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would've been better suited to a series format - it's already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn't work with the first movie and it wouldn't make as much money. To make it a great movie they should've dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","mrbledsoe53","3 June 2023","As visually stunning and groundbreaking of the animation, unfortunately, it was too much to take. I'm in my early 40s so younger viewers probably won't be affected as much. Didn't have an issue with Into the Spider-verse, but apparently, they increased the intensity to the point that I left with a headache. The different frame rates of characters in the same scene, the visual distortion in the background at times, made it difficult to focus and was basically visual overstimulation. I enjoyed the story and would like to see Beyond the Spider-verse but may have to just read about it if the animation is as intense as this film.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","tavismelvin","5 June 2023","Not great but it's good. They could of made this movie about 30mins shorter tbh. There's a few things I don't like about this movie. I found it sort of stupid that in a world of Spider-Man, not one Spider-Man could catch Morales. Just found it odd. You watch a whole movie to get a Clift hanger. Which wasn't that great. I felt like we were missing a big climax that never happened. I found the characters in the first movie more funny. They sort of tried too hard on this one. The cgi comic book art is cool. I find it distracting at times and it takes away from the emotions. I don't know I just had higher expectations from what reviews were saying.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","armagh-97917","16 June 2023","The first movie was great; original, funny, interesting, diverse. This movie is like you when say you like a song, so they play the same song twice as loud hoping you love it twice as much. It more disjointed, the emotions get lost, and really, the ending? In 2 hours and 16 minutes you can bring this movie to at least a temporary conclusion? The villain does not have a good enough back story to carry one, much less two movies. That said some of the spiderverses we see were very creative (especially India-Manhattan mix), and the lead character is as always very likeable. It's like they really didn't much else to say, and then they take too long to say what they did.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Ruben17","31 May 2023","This is whiteout a doubt peak Spider-Man and even peak cinema!Every scene in this animation movie was as good as perfect! The coloring, animation, character designs, music and the way they used the Spider humor was so funny and well timed!Bonding with character hasn't been as easy as it is here, they really explore the backgrounds of the different characters so emotional and passionately at the same time.It's a necessary darker & more emotional storyline for the characters but that's just how Peter Parkers storyline is...
It's a 2h20 movie but there wasn't one scene that I would've left out, I would've even preferred for it to go at almost 3h cause I wasn't a huge fan of the ending! You'll know when seeing it!There are so many Easter eggs & Spider-man's it to crazy for words!What more can i say than this is a masterpiece and probably the best Spider-Man movie to date!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ayoreinf","4 June 2023","I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.They didn't give up on anything; didn't allow a single detail to go amiss. They wouldn't give up on any bit of storytelling. It's all there, no matter how long the final cut will be, and still, it's not too long not even a second too long. The characters are all fully developed - real human beings drawn in comics form, but human just like any of us watching them on screen. It calls for some of the best voice acing I've seen, by each and every member of the cast. I simply can't single out anyone of them. They were all superb.And than the story itself - It's way more than just sci-fi comics. It doesn't limit itself to the usual issues of power and its moral implications. It's asking us the deep questions of what determines the path our life take? Are we ruled by our destiny? Is it all written in our stars? If I had a problem with most of the comics I read it was because of the fatalistic approach adopted by most of them. This one defies the tradition in the best way. It breaks down all the accepted rules and leaves us all hanging in one of the best cliff hangers ever.If you love comics, science fiction, action movies or simply real brilliant cinema - go see it.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","CinemaSerf","4 June 2023","Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it's also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you'd expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey's seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it's moments - assuming you can catch it - and there's a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole ""multiverse"" theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I'm not sure I'll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for ""Miles"" and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","HabibieHakim123","12 June 2023","Best Spider-Man movie ever???, more of like the worst Spider-Man movie i've ever watched, Across The Spider-Verse is indeed fits with the title, it's basically a set up movie for the big finale/battle for the next movie, this movie is just the middle of it, i have so many problem with the film from it being too incredibly long, incredibly slow, and incredibly quiet, i don't know if it's just my theater that the volume of the movie was low but it's just not right, the slowness of the narrative and pacing really bothering me, even the dialogue was so slow that the quiet distance between each line i can hear couple people snoring because how so empty the film is, how boring the movie is, and i'm not blaming them at all, it fills with so many unnecessary long slow scene, the soundtrack was bad and compare to the fire soundtrack of the previous movie there is zero memorable song, the voice acting pissed me off too because how they talk mostly so quitely and so whispery and it also sounds mostly like they have no emotion at all, Across The Spider-Verse is missing a lot of the key part including the OG team with Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker, etc. And i miss the depressed Peter B. Parker and in here he's having a perfect life which is good but not as fun and as engaging of a character anymore, the side villain of this movie was Miguel as Spider-Man 2099 and it didn't work as he was not as cool or as menacing as i expected, so do The Spot unfortunately, the positive was of course the animation was still great, i like both Spider-Man India and Spider-Punk, the action was decent, wasn't really blown away by it, it's quite entertaining, the cameos are fine, but the obvious cameos was very disappointing for me, anyway, Across The Spider-Verse for me was a bad example of a set up movie, a set up movie shouldn't be this long except if you fill it with a boring long narrative that fills with so many unnecessary long slow scene with bland and weak story, weak voice acting, and wrong decisions like this one, Across The Spider-Verse is bad, it's a failure, it's a complete waste of time and it could not be a waste of time if it's execute properly with the runtime, the content, and the story, it could be a less than 2 hours movie of a set up instead of more 30 plus minutes of unnecessary boring content, Into The Spider-Verse was a triumph while Across The Spider-Verse was a blunder, and i have my reason and that's the most important.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","hobgoblinlol","8 August 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is a good film, better than the first one for sure but not something that should have 8.9 rating. I'm mixed about the animation, some things look really great but the other half is nauseating. I really didn't like the phasing, the movie is more than 2 hours long and it feels like the chase scene in the multiverse takes 1/3 of the film. The Spot is a fun villain but still don't get how he suddenly goes from wanting to rob an ATM machine to wanting to destroy the entire world, don't like how he just disappeared for the rest of the film. Miguel was fun even though his backstory was also really generic. Across the Spider-Verse is a good movie, but it relies on flashy animation and fanservice to cover up it's flaws. For example, am I the only one not ok with classic Peter Parker bringing his daughter to extremely dangerous places? Or with Spider-Woman getting slammed to a train while being pregnant? Also, too many Spider-Mans are just a parody of themselves. Don't get me started with awful modern humor. Overall, the sequel is better than the first film, but even more overrated. Flawed plot, great animation, ok soundtrack, fun action, too much fanservice.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ibarix","7 October 2023","The animations are fantastic. Something between 3D, comics and animated film. Other... Where to start? 2.5 hours of a festival of colors and chaos. The film seems to have been made by someone with serious ADHD while on LSD. There is rarely a pause between sentences to process what has been heard. Combined with the cluttered animations, I had the impression that I was watching the movie at 1.5x speed. It can be seen that the film is totally adapted to new generations. Parents are friends instead of being parents, they use slang, everything is colorful, fast and ""adapted"" to short attention spans. There is no tension, the dialogues just flow without much expressiveness or meaning. There is more drama than action. Once again, the animations and style are absolutely phenomenal. The level of dialogues, scripts and everything else is not at the level of animations. The movie had to be at least half an hour shorter with a better story, less woke crap and far more suspense. This gives the impression that it is a Coca Cola advertisement. Due to excessive animations and hasty speech, the film is difficult to follow for long periods of time. A good idea, but the execution (except for the animations) is average at best.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jjakum-96413","6 June 2023","Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie but people are acting like this is Godfather 2. It's rated higher than The Dark Knight lol . I'd probably put it 7th on the list of Spider-Man movies.The positive:Gwen was probably the best part of the movie. They did a great job with her and she is probably as much the lead in this movie as Miles. Her action scenes were great and her character was likable.Miles character was also very well done and it was nice to see his character progress and mature from the last one. I'm a Peter Parker guy but there is definitely room for Miles.I thought the Spot, who is usually a lame villain, was pretty cool. I liked the character arc and progression they gave him.Miguel was a decent character. I'm hoping there is more character development in Pt 2 because he just comes off like an angry jerk the entire movie.The action scenes were well done and all the cameos were a lot of fun and the final twist at the end was fantasticThe negative:It was about 45 minutes too long. I miss the sub 2 hr movie. My youngest was bored to tears before the midway point.They totally neutered Peter B Parker, who was the best part of the first movie. They made him a complete buffoon.The animation was a bit much at times. It was headache inducing.Hobart was cool when you could understand what he was saying. It was like listening to a Gallagher brother voicing a Spider-Man character..I hated every scene that Spider-Woman was in. She was easily the worst out of all the main characters in the movie.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","shanayneigh","27 August 2023","Remember when people were able to tell a story in two hours or less? When stories had a beginning, middle and an end? When the number one priority wasn't to build a never ending franchise, but to simply tell a story?I liked Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) which I thought was surprisingly good.Please, give the whole multiverse schtick a rest. Sure, it offers the great (merchandising) opportunity to include a zillion versions of Spiderman, but it also reduces the stakes to absolutely nothing.In the first half of the movie they establish the new main bad guy (or so one would think) whose backstory is a ridiculous throwaway gag by one of the animators of the first movie. After an hour or so the new bad guy vanishes from the movie. As we get closer to the end I look at my watch thinking ""There's no way they'll wrap this up in the ten minutes that are left"". And of course they don't, since their priority isn't to tell a coherent story, but to build a franchise. So we're left hanging with no resolution. If we want one, we'll have to pay for the next movie too! Genius film making.Of course it was 20-30 minutes too long as per usual for comic book movies today. And this is only the first installment! Including the sequel (or rather, the third act of this movie) this simple story will probably be about an hour longer than Gone With The Wind. Amazing.I watched this movie on a huge screen in Tokyo. The visuals were grating. The dotted areas and the double/triple outlines, which I suppose are meant to emulate early printing techniques of shadows/gradients and out-of-focus areas did not look good on the big screen. The first movie employed the same visual style, although not as pronounced as in this sequel. On a small screen (like my 65 inch OLED at home) they were not an issue. But on a huge cinema screen they were making my eyes bleed.There is no way I'll pay to see the third one.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jimmystz","8 June 2023","Its not bad, it just doesn't fill the shoes.The movie is caught up in doing a bad impression of the original but misses the small details and cleverness that made the original a hit.So much of the plot and dialog is flat. The surprises didn't surprise me. I barely noticed them. The jokes where uninspired. I think I laughed once. The stakes where much higher but the tension felt much lower.Its worse in the technical aspects as well. Sound design, Pacing, Art Direction, Character Depth and Development all worse. Technically Across the Spider-Verse has a deeper world but not much of it was not memorable. I felt like the movie took a long time to say and show very little where the original did the complete opposite.When the squeal was announced and I heard they had different directors I raised an eyebrow. I lightly considered that team to be miracle workers. Unfortunately the concerns seem proven. The current Directing team says they're done after the second act of Across the Spider-Verse.I know a colossal amount of time, energy and love went into this movie and I'm scorching it. Squeals are notoriously hard to balance. They are often caught between what the original was and what so many people imagine that it should have/ could have been. Squeals sometimes they get tangled trying to be an unnecessary correction.Despite all these criticisms its still a good movie. There was a lot to appreciate. It was fun and characters will make you feel something. The best parts of the movie where all around the Parents of the many Spider-Verses. They tried to make the importance of family the core but that is difficult in an action movie were the hero's are living split secrete lives. Holding out hope for the next one.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","trinaboice","1 November 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
This is only Part 1 of a two-part sequel. Sweet! Fans are thrilled, rewarding the movie with $221 million at the worldwide opening. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, a truly magical team.Writing credits go to Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and David Callaham. The story is about Miles Morales who catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.THINGS I LIKED:
The animation is colorful, energetic, and impressively expressive. It combines classic comic book design with modern-day CGI for a thrilling effect. Each frame looks like it came straight out of a moving comic book. Fans are completely nerding out!The cast of voice talents includes Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, Brian Tyree Henry, J. K. Simmons, Luna Lauren Velez, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch, Jorma Taccone, Karan Soni, and Shea Whigham.The script is extremely inventive, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time.We get some creative villains that come from various multiverses.Lots and lots of action!The movie takes place across 6 dimensions with 240 characters in it and over 1,000 animators working on it! It's the largest crew of any animated movie ever made!So many Easter eggs. They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics. Wow.This is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything. Scratch that...two or three times! The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can't see it all.I've never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material.I got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man. Haha
I've always loved animated movies that include live-action characters.The cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment.Surprising twists caught me off guard. Sweet.There is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual.I've just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days! His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience. The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash. It's another fun adventure into the metaverse!You can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you'll understand and appreciate it even more if you have.If you love Hailee Steinfeld's character of Gwen Stacey, you'll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some viewers and fans will be annoyed that the movie doesn't actually end at the end and they'll have to wait an entire year to see the rest of the story. Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-verse is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024.Some of the action scenes are chaotic and happen so fast that you don't have time to really savor the moment.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is not just some random kids' movie. It's very mature and filled with humor and insights that adults can enjoy.Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles.!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Marian25","31 May 2023","It just excels in every category! Peak cinema right there. I can't imagine the amount of work that went into this movie, every aspect of it just blew me away.Words cannot accurately describe this experience so I'm not even gonna try. I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!It's time for everyone to appreciate animation as a veritable film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly shows that you just can't do in a live-action movie what you can do with animation. I 100% think that the richness of emotions this masterpiece conveys was greatly benefited by the animation and its mesmerizing style. Just see it and you'll agree!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Benjamin-M-Weilert","22 September 2023","Without fail, I have watched wildly successful movies gain sequels that were too big for just one movie. The latest entry in this Trilogy Conundrum is none other than the animated Spider-Verse series. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) was a stylish and refreshing animated film that won the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Its sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023), is equally good in both storytelling and animation. However, the size of such a story being stretched over two films affected some of this movie's pacing.I am increasingly becoming a fan of the ""stylized"" animated movies like Into the Spider-Verse and Across the Spider-Verse. Pixar can show how realistic CGI animation can be, but I found truly creative CGI animation in other studios like this one. This ""cartoony"" style lends itself to the humor of the fight between Miles (Shameik Moore) and Spot (Jason Schwartzman). It's also versatile enough to be serious when it needs to be. If anything, it is able to highlight the visual differences between the different universes.Superfans of the Spider-Man franchise likely got tons of references from decades of Spider-Man iterations. Even if this is your first introduction to the character, it's likely you already know about the ""canon events"" that make up the central theme of this movie. Although it was enjoyable to see Spider-Man in different settings, the film's second half was sluggish as it built up to the next movie's premise. Not knowing where they were going to cut to a ""To Be Continued"" card made the last bit seem endless. Still, I'm excited to watch the last part of this trilogy since the first two parts have been solid.A solid Trilogy Conundrum entry in the Spider-Verse saga, I give Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 4.5 stars out of 5.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","will-howlett","2 June 2023","I loved loads about this film, mainly the amazing action sequences and the sweet sweet fan service (one bit of fan service got a big loud oooooh from myself and most of the cinema).The problem I had with it is that despite it being a 2 parter so much of the emotional exposition was stretched out far longer than necessary through overlong dialogue. About an hour of the film is dedicated to ensuring we understand that Miles is a young man finding his path through life (I have no idea how some of the younger kids in the audience sat through it, they must have just been mesmerised by the flashy colours). It could have been handled in a much more condensed manner by better writers and still had the required impact. Given the film ends at a point that feels like a natural final third act it left me feeling shortchanged.If the overlong dialogue scenes had been condensed then I believe there would have been no need for the 2 parter. But then people wouldn't pay to see 2 films instead of 1.I expect when the initial mega fan reaction dies down and more ordinary filmgoers leave shocked at the ""to be continued"" message the IMDb score will dip dramatically.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","lauralewis-48859","23 June 2023","These movies are spectacular. I loved the first one and thought there was no way they could make the second one as good. It is as good or even better!! It is engaging and funny. It has such a good plot and storyline. The characters are wonderfully developed. The spot is a really cool villain and the twist at end is wow! Beside all of this, the visuals are phenomenal. It's an experience to watch it. I can't imagine the amount of talent that went into making this movie. I saw this in the movie theater and I cannot wait to rewatch it when it starts streaming.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","michvanbeek","10 August 2023","Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse dates back to 2018. The film was received extremely positively by friend and foe and rightly so. And such an animated film with a sublime animation style was something that had never been seen before on this scale. Like going to a comic book that was translated on screen and with a very, very good story. It may take five years for the sequel, but patience pays off and how. It seemed a fairly tough task in advance to be able to surpass Into the Spider-Verse, but this has absolutely succeeded in every area. Where the regular Marvel movies have fallen into disrepair, where the quality of those movies has gone up and down, the Spider-Verse movies are definitely not and maybe it's better for Marvel to focus on these gems than again for the umpteenth time to bring some weak and much too expensive live action film into the cinemas that are destroyed by the media and the public.The story is enriched by deepening the backgrounds of, for example, Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales and that really works out perfectly. Why mention Gwen first? That's simple, the story around Gwen really worked out best in this movie. The opening of the movie might make you think ok, I hope it really gets a lot better than this, but this feeling will go away very soon. The origin of Spider-Man's enemy Spot is beautifully worked out. At first it seems like a funny and above all clumsy figure who has absolutely no control over his powers. When it finally becomes clear who Spot is and what his ultimate intentions are, Gwen comes back into the picture with Miles, but it is not yet clear why. Until Miles finds out that all universes are connected and that Gwen turns out to be a key that brings Miles to the Spider-people, led by Miguel O'Hara. This all sounds very dull, but the story seems to have a really hypnotic effect and that is where the strength of the film lies.With a running time of almost two and a half hours, it might stop people from taking a quick look at the film, but the running time is justified. Where Into the Spider-Verse still felt like the best, which strangely enough was still kept under two hours, that is really different with this film. With Into the Spider-Verse it was in a chaotic and almost impossible to follow color explosion called the ending. This is really different in Across the Spider-Verse. The entire film is expertly worked out, with the story only leaving you wanting more. Obviously this is because the open ending is just a cutoff in the middle of the story, but that's not the only thing. The coming together of every Spider-Man in history and more also builds up to more than just confronting Spot. Of course we could dedicate an entire review to how beautiful the animation is, but this was of course already very clear after the first part. The different animation styles are mixed in this film with a number of other surprises that not only bring you to the drawn or animated Spider-Man, but much more.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse surpasses its predecessor in every way and raises the bar for a sequel. Not only the animation is fantastic, but also the story is perfectly worked out. Perhaps with Across the Spider-Verse we had the best Spider-Man movie yet and that really promises something for the sequel. It is especially the depths of Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales that add considerable force to the film. The threat coming from enemy Spot is really good and the part where Miles joins the Spider-people is really well done. The playing time of almost two and a half hours is strangely enough still a bit on the short side, but good. That is not surprising in this case, because the film ends in the middle of the story, so there is still plenty to do. The movie has been in theaters for a while and for those who haven't seen the movie in theaters yet, do yourself a favor and just go there.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","RogerRoger77","11 June 2023","Ok, my title is deliberately snarky, but ...Like the first movie, the animation here is spectacular. Plus, there are lots of incidental pleasures, mainly seeing all the different Spidermen and their crazy powers and costumes.However, I just wasn't that taken with the characters and plot. Maybe I'm too old for these sorts of films, but do we really need scene after scene of whiny teenagers talking about their feelings? Personally, all I really want from a Spiderman movie is some fun web action and a few zingy one liners. And a more interesting villain than the one we got here.Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I always thought the point of superheroes was to be focused on others - saving the world and all that - not endlessly dissecting their own emotions and obsessing about their families and relationships. Guess this just reflects the world we live in: a Spiderman movie for the me, me, me generation.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","dburris-45933","4 June 2023","It's not very often we get an animation film like this...The art is astounding, colorful visuals, a jaw dropping movie phenomenon.

Has its silly moments without taking away the essence of the story. Has a very dark tone. This is a movie is aimed not only for children but for comic fans and adults alike. They really achieved movie history and everyone involved did a stiller job! One of the best Spider-Man movies thus far!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","shoebsaad","5 July 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings back onto the big screen with a stunning sequel that pushes the boundaries of animation and delivers a thrilling and heartfelt story.

With an eclectic mix of genres and tracks, it perfectly complements the film's energy and emotional beats, enhancing the overall experience.If there is any drawback to Across the Spider-Verse, it is that we have to wait for the second part of the story. The film leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the continuation of the adventure, which is a testament to its ability to engage and captivate.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a remarkable sequel that pushes the boundaries of animation while delivering a compelling and emotionally resonant story.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","safayet_shawon","10 August 2023","Just watched the movie yesterday (and rewind the last 30 minutes or so several times!).Very few times in multiple film industry's history, the sequel surpassed its predecessors. ""Into the spider-verse"" put itself in such height with every possible parameters like story-line, character buildup, animation style etc and of course the music!Before watching ""across the spider-verse"", I was confident that, this one will at most come close to the first one, AT MOST...
But boy, was I wrong!! Without leaking any (probably!) spoilers, I'll say just this one thing. I watched about 4/5k movies plus TV shows at least. And I never gladly accepted a show/ movie which ended with a cliffhanger, actually hated them. But this one will remain the SINGULAR exception. And I'll be eagerly waiting for ""beyond the spider-verse"".And the last two songs (self love and am I dreaming) hit really hard, specially after watching the movie at one go.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ha77y73ad97","2 August 2023","There are very few sequels that come to mind that outperform the original in every way, this one certainly does. Not falling into the trap of bigger is better and throwing uncessercary cameos, fan service and budget at a series that was on a very strong footing. Everything in this movie had a purpose as apart of a trilogy.When they did announce that there was going to be a sequel to Into the Spider-verse I was unsure as that ended in a very finite way almost a cash grab from Sony on the back of the first one. I will eat my words that i was wrong, they seem as though they knew where they wanted both this and 3rd installments to end. The story of where this ended was a prefect place and i truly hope that there are screenings for both the 2nd and 3rd when new installment is released.One of the greatest leap forwards that has come from these 2 movies so far is that the animation is on another level artistically wise. Each of the Spider-men has their own unique style, as there have been tones of response over Spider-Punk and is way of being animated is a stroke of genius. Gwen Staceys world bring ripped straight from the panels of a comic with the watercolour emotion changing backgrounds even down to the last universe they visit. That cannot be understated as one of the best designed worlds in the series, as we are going to pick up from that we are going to be in for a visual treat.The cast yet again is stacked and the team behind the first have certainly built upon adding new actors to the roster and Oscar Issacs is a stand out as always. The Anti-Hero Spider-man is a tough character to take on. Played to perfection! Scary yet sombar, violent yet compassionate and down to his back story these are going to touge at the heart strings to then be hating him for the actions that he takes.As a second chapter in a 3 part story this is a marvel (pardon the pun) ends with everyone wanting more as a true story should. As mentioning before this goes into that very exclusive category along with T2: judgement day, The Two Towers and a personal favourite Sherk 2 to name just a few!","10/10"

I have never seen a sequel so good, I honestly think it was better then the first film. The movie is beautifully constructed. The art work is phenomenal and story is extremely interesting. It has everything in a movie that you could ask for and its great for all audiences. There is no agenda being pushed, or political message trying to be told, instead its just a good old fashion movie with a ton of fun, action and adventure, great family values and innocent love. It has the perfect balance of everything. The art work is stunning. And the story is captivating. I could honestly sit and watch this movie over and over again.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","otto_tieleman","3 July 2023","Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse continues where Spider-man: into the spider-verse left of.What changed is the scale of the story and the with of animation used to tell the story. The first movie shook up the animation world in a positive way and we can see it's influence in movies like Puss in Boots 2. But this movie expands on it's ambition in animation to go even wilder and more inventive.All the beautiful animation won't be much if the story didn't live up to the animation. We have seen many Marvel films and tv series from Marvel/Disney that have degrade to the point of bloated CGI without any enticing stories, loveless created only to make money but don't deliver on the rich world the comic books have created. Thankfully Sony wiped the slate clean and created a unique, excited and touching story. Not only Miles Morales has an incredible story arch but every side character that is created for the story. Making all characters relatable and it makes you care.Go watch this movie if you can on the best screen you can find as it is worth your money and time and that is something we couldn't have said for a long time for a super hero movie.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ykjdh","2 June 2023","This might possibly be one of the best movies I've seen all year. I'll definitely put it in my top two for the year. The comics look better in animation in my opinion and the design of this super man looked great in IMAX.If there's anything to complain about, it might be the running time which with previews ran around 2hrs and 25 min. Like a lot of good action movies thought it seem to go by pretty fast. The movie doesn't drag and does a good job with its pacing.This time around Miles Morales finds his spdey going across dimensions to save the universe. I'm not revealing any spoilers but let's just say for the fans of the comics, this one stays true to the material. The soundtrack isn't bad either and helps with the pacing. Above all this is one super hero done right. Recommend you see it on the largest screen you can find. Maybe even the drive in.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","2 June 2023","After the explosion of the super collider, there is a growing threat to all known worlds. The nature, identity and responsibility of being a Spider-person is examined.This is much bigger than the first, and they even manage to address the rare flaws: this time, despite the many universes and literally hundreds of characters, it never loses focus on Miles Morales(Moore, spot-on), and the creative, memorable action scenes are now each completely, not only mostly, unique. Considering what I just described, you might not believe me when I say that somehow this manages to not be completely overwhelming. That they managed to make the concept simultaneously infinite in possibility and yet not let it get overpowering.You can watch this without having any prior knowledge of the original movie, the comics, or other iterations. It will tell you everything you need to know. Certain things won't have the same emotional impact, and you will have to pay extremely close attention. But they actually managed it. Your average Spider-Man movie says that a person(way too frequently a Peter Parker, about time we got some more diversity) bitten by the right spider will gain superpowers, don a suit and fight crime. This one expands that into Various animals, shows literally dozens of them, in addition to featuring some great representation(ethnic, gender, age, body size). I would have loved to see openly trans individuals, especially considering the intense reactionary backlash against a split second frame in one of the trailers. Here's hoping we'll get there in part three.This is rated PG. There is no swearing or sexuality, and violence is mild. I recommend this to everyone. Regardless of your age, you can find something to love in this. 10/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","russellquisenberry","4 June 2023","15/10!!!! Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece not just for superhero movies and animated movies, but cinema itself!! The Empire Strikes Back meets The Dark Knight of animated sequels!! The story is more dramatic and emotional than I thought. The animation is beautiful, mixing all sorts of animation styles like computer animated, hand drawn, comic book, etc. The voice acting is stellar, especially Shamiek Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, and Oscar Isacc!!! My favorite superhero movie I've seen in a long time. Dear Academy, don't just give this the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but also a nomination for Best Picture!!!! Go see this immediately!!!!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","cadillac20","3 June 2023","Can't rave enough about this movie. Everything was excellent and I have nothing I can think of to complain about. It was a joy to be back, hanging out with Miles, Gwen, Peter, and the handful of new characters. The film takes it's time early on developing Gwen and Miles as they live their separate lives in their respective dimensions and deal with the frustrations and realities of being their own Spider persons. We're immediately given the emotional weight of Gwen's life, one that is very lonely and who has seemingly lost the only friend she had left after having to say goodbye to Miles. Miles is in a similar predicament, though he is less hung up on being alone and missing Gwen, and more so on having to balance school, his responsibilities to his parents, and his role as Spider-Man.After spending some time with their respective lives, we get to the meat of the story, which involves new villain-of-the-week-becoming-major-villain The Spot, who is setting out to further disrupt the multiverse after Kingpin's plot in the first movie. Miguel O'Hara, aka Spider-Man 2099, comes into the picture as having established a hub of Spider characters from various dimensions who are attempting to fix the anomalies created by the collider's explosion from the first film. Miguel acts as a darker version of Spider-Man who has little tolerance for anyone treating their task with anything but the utmost seriousness.The animation and art is once again excellent, this time giving us various designs for the different Spider characters, with Spider Punk and Crimson Spider being highlights. Everyone gets a chance to shine as a character, even when their part is small and the loads of easter eggs and references will delight fans while not feeling superfluous or there purely for fan service. Like No Way Home, this is a celebration of the Spider-Man franchise, but feeling like it's celebrating the entirety of the brand, covering everything from comics, animation, live action, and even the video games. There are quite a few pleasant surprises.Some might be off put by the abrupt ending, especially if they have no idea this the first part of a two part film duoglogy, but having known this going in, I felt pretty comfortable with where it ended. It is a cliffhanger ending, so don't expect to feel like the story has an ending, but it creates an anticipation for the next movie and it's something I can wait patiently for as it comes early next year. Overall, the film, like the first one, demonstrates itself to be one of the year's best. I even expect this to possibly be my favorite film of 2023.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ritesh657","3 June 2023","SpidermanAcrossTheSpiderverseReviewMy Rating : 96/100Across The Spiderverse is a spellbinding and mesmerizing experience and passes the sequel test with aplomb. Starting from developing the endearing characters we loved from the first part, it adds a few solid new ones which are written as brilliantly as we can expect. The dazzling cinematography and animations leaves you tranfixed and the thrilling plot shifts leave you floored. Spiderverse is expanded vividly with the captivating work of humour, emotions and keeps you excited for what next throughout. The loudest hooting when Pavitra Prabhakar , our very own desi Indian Spider-Man comes on screen got me exhilarated. With almost all emotions getting evoked with the drama, tension and elevated climax, the cliffhanger makes me thrilled for the final act. Magical experience.The writing is superlative and introduction of the new concept of Canon event definitely opens up new possibilities. Miguel's Spiderman is terrorizing and adds more seriousness to the plot. While the emotional moments of Miles and Gwen with their family add to the list of winsome moments during the course of the runtime. Manhattan is now Mumbattan and Pavitra Prabhakar made us go crazy. The action and visuals are enthralling to say the least.Overall, if you likes the part 1 stop reading ahead and go watch this epic spectacle asap and if you haven't then its the right time of this weekend to catch up both parts and join in the community of Miles Morales fan club.Instagram & Twitter : streamgenx.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","poseyfan","3 June 2023","One of the best animated movies I've ever seen, hands down. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first. I thought it was a tad overrated. This one takes the strengths of the first and ups it to 11.The animation: etherealThe voice acting: pristineThe story: well doneThe characters: convincing and well-developedThe themes in this movie are very good, and they're told in a thought out and mature way. In other words, it's not afraid to make you feel things and maybe scare your kids a little, despite the PG rating.Comparisons may not always be the best thing, but I believe this movie is better made than No Way Home.The twists at the end were completely unexpected. Overall, the final chapter was set up in a fantastic way.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Pjtaylor-96-138044","11 June 2023","'Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023)' is overwhelmingly fantastic. I'm still buzzing just thinking about it. If the first flick put the bar for stylised animation in the stratosphere, this just catapulted it into another dimension. It's hard to put into words just how viscerally vibrant and visually stunning it is. Its set-pieces simply hit different. The animation, the energy, the aesthetics, the choreography, the music, the sound design, everything just comes together in its unique brand of finely-tuned controlled chaos that keeps each and every exhilarating moment crystal clear even when there's a million different things happening all at once. It's phenomenal. It isn't afraid to pump the breaks every once in a while, too. It slows down considerably to develop its characters and explore their relationships with one another. It's actually quite an emotional experience at times. It has an unconventional structure and, as a result, it takes some pretty big swings with its story. There are some sequences that could have been tightened up and I really wish the picture had retained its original Part One title just to temper people's expectations, but the fact that this film's biggest flaw is simply that it ends is almost unbelievable. I can't say it's better than 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)' because it's essentially only half of what it's eventually going to be, but it's a miracle that it's at least as good as that masterpiece (and even outperforms it in terms of sheer spectacle). If they manage to stick the landing with the upcoming sequel (which I have no doubt they will), this is going to be one of the best five-hour movies ever made.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","willphelan","4 November 2023","I never thought Into the Spider Verse was a movie that needed a sequel, but Across the Spider Verse is just as incredible as Into the Spider Verse. The animation style is even more beautiful than in the first movie, every shot looks like a painting. The exploration of Miles and Gwen and what it really means to be Spider Man is excellent, and leads to so many deep and emotional moments. Every scene with Miles' parents were top tier. The voice cast all gave it everything they had, and Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen was the stand out for me. The cliffhanger ending was so epic, it actually gave me chills. If the third movie is as good as these first two this might become the best trilogy of all time. 10/10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Rectangular_businessman","29 June 2023","Does Across the Spider-Verse really deserves the 8.9 score it currently holds on Imdb? I don't know, but I enjoyed it immensely from beginning to end, leaving my hopes very high for its next part.Despite its unusual lenght, it never gets boring, keep the same level of fun and excitement from its predecessor, with a rather impressive mixture of many different animation styles and a solid characterization for its large cast.The bar has been set pretty high, and I really hope the sequel does not disappoint. I think it would the be the ultimate resolution of all the loose ends left here which will ultimately decide the staying power of the Spiderverse series.8.5/10.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Dominic_25_","6 June 2023","I don't remember how long it has been since I've seen the first one but I am pretty sure I liked it better than this one. This is both a sequel and an unfinished story which negatively impacts my interpretations.First of all this film is once again really well done, visually. They went from the interesting art style of the first one to expanding and giving the other universes unique styles. It is so well done and so pretty and I only rarely got overwhelmed with the visuals. I can think of only once. This is a really great film to look at. The filmmakers did such an amazing job.The story is incomplete but pretty well done. I would rather have seen a 6 hour film than a part one. I like how they expanded the characters from the first film and explored more of the multiverse. I am not a huge fan of references to the MCU but the short references to the other live action Spider-Man films are less annoying. Also I only get like half of the references to the comics because I have never read a single Spider-Man comic book. But that's fine I'm not really interested in fan service, if I knew more I might just have been more annoyed. So I loved it and I loved seeing so many different versions of this character. Hobie is my favorite character, once I got used to his accent I realized he has amazing politics. I loved everything he did in this film and I wanted to see more of him but I'm guessing we'll get more of him in part 2.Being a film so heavily interconnected to comics, I feel like they decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to end it on a cliffhanger but they were wrong. The MCU does this thing where they don't have their films be self-contained stories and so they are fine with leaving threads open and teasing future installments. All very similar to actual comic books which are famous for their cliffhangers. Unfortunately, this is a film and I treat them as such because I like films more than comics. If they wanted to tell a grand story then make it a longer movie, I can handle it. Whether they did it because they wanted a second release date for more money, or they did it because of the logistics of having a 3-hour plus movie, I think it was a bad idea. If I wanted an incomplete story that ends on a cliffhanger then I'd read a comic or watch a show.I do think this film justifies it's own existence and I'm glad it was made. I think this story was interesting enough to carry a 6 hour runtime so it could have finished the story. I didn't mind 2.5 hours because it was such a fun story and the visuals were fantastic. Once the second part comes out I'll probably pretend this was just one long movie.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","awsafzidane","2 June 2023","One of the most overwhelming movie experiences of my life. A feast for the visual and auditory senses.I had HUGE expectations from this as the first one is one of my favourite animated movies of all time, and this one even surpassed those!It's one of the longest animated movies of Hollywood, but it doesn't drag for a single moment. There's so much happening in this film, it feels like a miracle that it still works so well! So many different animation styles, such great use of colours that portray the emotions of each scene perfectly, dope soundtrack, countless Easter Eggs; and it still doesn't feel exhausting. So many characters and almost all of them have distinct characteristics. You can sense that the creators have an amazing understanding of the characters, and they do them full justice.But it's not just a compilation of awesome psychedelic animation with some great score, it has a fascinating plot too. It handles the multiverse well, delivers a couple of neat plot twists, while being an emotional coming-of-age story of a couple of teenagers trying to balance their dual lives, and maintaining their relationship with their parents.It's the best Spider-Man film ever made. It's one of the best movies ever made.Now I can't wait for the final film which will establish the Spider-Verse trilogy as one of the greatest trilogies of all time.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","shiigi1","7 June 2023","Spoiler alert: At 2 hours and fifteen minutes, this is not a complete movie, and unfortunately this was not clear before sitting through this. I was fine with the movie and thought that it was well done, however I dragged my spouse to it, whom I knew would not be a fan, and he was left with a worse feeling than I even expected. Needless to say that he will not be seeing the next installment. Following this movie, we then saw Fast and Furious X, which was also an unadvertised two parter. Hollywood needs to do a better job of alerting folks to this so that an informed decision can be made. It seems that movies are getting longer, and are we now seeing that even 2 1/2 hours isn't adequate to tell a story?","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","burntoutboy","2 June 2023","Wow wow wow. This is absolute masterpiece, cannot fault it at all. The animation is probably the best I've ever seen. The level of detail is ridiculous and the amount of effort that went into making this is clearly shown. The voice acting is great, the music is great, it's funny and lots of cool Easter eggs. The story is great as well and leads perfectly into the sequel which I absolutely cannot wait for.I wouldn't be surprised if not only if this was nominated for best animated picture at the Oscars but also best picture, it's that good.There's nothing more to say, just go watch it in yh Cinema and appreciate the art!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jay632","4 June 2023","To be quite honest, the first one was unique, but i didn't think it was great. This movie took everything it learned from part 1 and made vast improvements on every level.This was the multiverse movie i was looking for that the mcu just never did properly. The worlds had depth and not just skipping through it as fast as possible without a chance to digest it.Story was good too, i wasn't expecting much, since we already got the backstory in part 1. But they did a great job expanding the story.Animation also improved from part 1, it was really unique, but they just made it better.By far my favorite part are the cameo's of different spidermans. There's so many, this is fan service done right.","2/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","flavours_ignobleo","3 January 2024","I absolutely loved the previous movie Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, it became my favourite animation to date by far. The storyline, animation and soundtrack is amazing! 10/10...But I lost interest in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse within 30mins. The storyline felt boring, repetitive and scatty. The cramming in of as many teen and family cliches as possible (in order to make it relatable no doubt) felt very forced and unnatural. It made it more of a teen movie, rather than for all the family like the last one. There is also a sense that the Diversity Equity Inclusion 'committee' strongly informed the story and characters, which again came across as forced, which left me wondering was their top priority writing a great story, or was it to meet certain DEI quotas.Anyway this film does not compare to the previous and I have no idea why it's scored so highly, one film is an absolute masterpiece, the other is a giant action-packed cliche.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","tjohnson-07046","3 July 2023","This is the best spider-man movie ever yes even better than Tobey Maguire and tom holland movies. Miles was the same character in the first movie really good. The animation was perfect no complaints Gwen was a better character in this movie than the first movie more intenersting and compelling. This is the best version of the Spot he was funny but over-time he became a huge threat to every spider-verse in fact every multi-verse. Miguel was ruthless and a very compelling antagonist. And every joke made me laugh.no bad jokes unlike the MCU now. I was suprised how good this was. The ending could make people disappointed but i wasn't i was hyped for the next one.","10/10"

Every single scene makes you to look at it with high focus in case you miss something.The artwork is fantastic. Massive step up from previously awesome ITTS.The Soundtrack man, it is up there with the very best for me.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ar_amulya","2 June 2023","That 5 year long wait was worth it! Just like with the first movie it's going to take a long time to fully process what I just watched. But I couldn't be happier right now. Across the Spider-Verse is everything I wanted in a Spider-Man movie and is the perfect sequel. Most importantly even with all the spider characters/cameos this is still Miles' movie. That ending?!?! We're really about to get one of the best trilogies ever.Special thank you to all the artists that contributed to this movie. I don't know how they do it, but visually Across the Spider-Verse is on another level. There are so many shots that blew my mind. I can't wait to break down this movie frame by frame. This is just the beginning. I know this movie is going to consume my life for the next couple of years.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","inovski","11 June 2023","We waited 5 years for a sequel and let me tell you, it was worth it.This movie had me glued to my seat for the entirety of it's runtime. I loved everything about this movie hence why I rated it a 10.Animation: The animation was breathtaking, it never seized to amaze me. It is so obvious from the get go that the people behind this movie put in so much time and effort to create what's probably the best spiderman adaptation that exists. Without the talent and dedication from the animators, this movie wouldn't even be half as good.The plot: Superb all in all, everything tied together very well and I enjoyed how we had 2 storylines at the same time that get tied together, which makes the whole story that much better and immersive. I'm sad that we have to wait another 3-5 years for the next one but at least we know it will be perfect.The characters: They perfectly captured spiderman's charm and humor. The small differences they showed in each spiderman was really fun to see as well.All in all this movie took what the first one did well and made it basically perfect. This is the first time I've come out of the theater without any cons to list. If you haven't watched the movie yet, DO IT NOW!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Blashma","1 June 2023","The movie did a great job in the first part and I really enjoyed it so personally I am especially looking forward to the second part and after watching the movie it exceeded my expectations.I love how the film expands its scope and adds more stories to the characters, specifically Gwen (Gwanda), in the new cast I'm super impressed with Oscar Isaac as the voice of Miguel O 'hara , he's been through enough pain to make himself responsible for protecting Spider-Verse and believing himself to be right no matter what . Speaking of Miles, he's really matured in this part, he's just a 15 year old kid who has to balance his Spider-man lifestyle with himself, I like the way Miles tackles problems differently from the rest of Spider-Man . The movie is really fan service, making viewers satisfied with every detail, graphics and family story of Spider-Man.I love every moment of this movie and am looking forward to the sequel, hopefully more Miles and Spider-Verse movies will come out.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","IsThatJoseph21","4 June 2023","For the past two years, No Way Home was my favorite Spider-Man movie. Now, that title belongs to Across the Spider-Verse. Besides being a great Spider-Man movie, I'd consider this a great movie in general. I just saw Across the Spider-Verse, but I already feel comfortable placing this movie in the same category of sequels like The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, Terminator 2, and The Dark Knight, which surpass every aspect of their predecessors.I love Into the Spider-Verse as much as everyone else, but I believe Across the Spider-Verse improves everything from the first movie. The one part of Into the Spider-Verse that always held it back from a 10/10 to me is the villains. Kingpin and the Prowler are serviceable, but I always thought they were uninteresting. With Across the Spider-Verse, the villain is a major improvement. Miguel O'Hara had a compelling motivation, while also being a genuinely threatening antagonist.I already thought Into the Spider-Verse's animation was breathtaking, but Across the Spider-Verse somehow surpasses it. The entire movie looks like a work of art, but the highlight for me would be every scene in Gwen's universe. The backgrounds and colors in those scenes are gorgeous. Just like the first movie, the fights here are fast-paced and fun. There are plenty of memorable action scenes here, but I particularly loved the first fight between Miles Morales and the Spot.This is sort of out of topic, but I also think Across the Spider-Verse was a better multiverse movie than Multiverse of Madness. Not only was the concept of other dimensions better utilized in Across the Spider-Verse, they were also more visually distinct here. Maybe it's because of the fact that this movie is animated, but each dimension in Across the Spider-Verse was able to have their own style and color to them, unlike the ones featured in Multiverse of Madness.Overall, Across the Spider-Verse is yet another masterpiece in the Spider-Verse series. It's both my favorite Spider-Man movie and my favorite movie of 2023. I know this year isn't over yet, but it's going to be tough to top this movie. I give Across the Spider-Verse a 10/10.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","thePopcornExplorer","24 June 2023","I think as audiences we know how hard it is for sequels to meet our expectations when the first installment of a saga was already an outstanding piece of art, it feels so good when sequels keep those standards...The sequel of the Spider-Verse gets almost everything right, it manages to bring you back to the insanely original multiverse storyline that was introduced to us on the first film, yet it manages to not fall into the trap of being a repetitive storyline with the same elements.I can't even properly comment the animation work, there are no words to describe how amazing it is, the detail that each universe depicted seems to have its own kind of animation is insane and it continues to be without a doubt the only Marvel / DC movie to make a proper homage to comic books, the original super hero format.It keeps the frenetic energy that the first got us used to, something is always happening and it's interesting to keep following, elements of the first story are brought to continue the protagonists journey and it's an organic narrative, doesn't feel like a forced story line for the sake of a sequel, it makes sense.All universes are beautifully animated, the soundtrack gives you ton of energy, everywhere in the movie you see marvelous imagery, a true piece of art.Adding the this the voice acting is also on point, it's an animated movie and it feels that it is leading the way on how animation should be used specially on the super hero / comic book adaptation world.Filled with dramatic and eye tearing moments and of course with themes that are transversal to probably every person either parent or child and that most of us can probably relate, gives soul to an already beautiful film. A pioneer film that continues on top of its game, I can't wait for the third..!","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","neil-476","2 June 2023","Miles Morales' second adventure brings him back into contact with Spider-Gwen. Outcast from her own universe where she has been erroneously accused of the death of her Peter, she is now working with a squad of spider-people patrolling the multiverse.

It mixes some emotional character stuff with exciting action, and interesting (and sometimes unexpected) plot developments, right up to the end. Oh did I say ""The End""?...There's plenty of fan service here.Yes, but what does it look like? Because the look of the first one was striking, right? I bet this is jnot as good, or just more of the same, right?Wrong. The look of this film, whether a quiet scene in an office, or a hyper-kinetic action scene, is simply dazzling.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","alindsayal","21 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse was one of my favourite comic book films ever, and after all these years the sequel, Across The Spider-Verse has been released and I have finally had a chance to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Miles Morales travel across the multiverse where he meets other Spider-Men that at are charged with protecting it, Miles must understand what it takes to be a true hero.Main Character
Shameik Moore is back as Miles Morales and he is fantastic. He plays the teenage spider-man very well and he is easily likeable which is great to see. There is more to him though, Moore adds real emotion to the story of Morales and the things he goes through is well done. Gwen Stacy voiced by Hailee Steinfeld gets way more to do in this film and I would argue her character is as important as Miles. She gives such an emotional performance and Gwen is a character that we learn a lot about and see how she really fits into this story. The dynamic between both characters is really well delivered and I am glad it worked so well.Supporting Characters
This film has probably the most amount of characters a film ever has, so I certainly won't be going through all of them but I will acknowledge that they are all great.Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Velez return as Miles parents and they are a large part of this story. Seeing how the dynamic between Miles and his parents goes down is a really crucial element of this film and the two performers did a great job.Oscar Isaac plays Miguel O'Hara and is fantastic. It seems like he is becoming the king of comic book films and shows and he is no different here, O'Hara is the leader of the team of Spider-Men and he is the most serious character in this film. As you learn more about him, you understand why he does what he does and it makes him a really interesting character.Jake Johnson is back as Peter B Parker, though he has a much smaller role. Even though he isn't in the film a huge amount he is used effectively and I felt like he was somebody that added to the overall story of the film and how it affects Miles life.There are some other great characters specifically Jason Schwartzman as The Spot, Issa Rae as Jessica Drew and Daniel Kaluuya as Spider-Punk. They all were fun additions to the cast here.Story
The story is fantastic. As I mentioned above, it focuses equally on Miles Morales & Gwen Stacy and it deals with both stories incredibly well. This film exceeds what the majority of people would expect for an animated film with the amount of depth and emotion that goes ahead with these characters and the situations that they are put in. This is also a great ending, which feels appropriate for the film and effects every character that has been a spotlight of the film.Script
The script is really great. The comedy is well written, this film is funny and not in a childish way. It is clever with its comedy and it picks appropriate times to use it. But the drama is where the film succeeds, you really do care about these characters and how the events in the film change the characters.Style
The first film was amazing to look at and so creative in its design. This film is even better, you can't take your eyes off the screen because of the colours and use of technical devices that no ever film does like it. This films pacing is great too, it clearly has different acts to the film and I was never bored,Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is an Epic film that just like its predecessor is one of the best comic book films ever made. Ignore the fact that it is an animated film, this is an amazing film and especially for Spider-Man films needs to be see.Rating - 10/10.","5/10"

I got so overstimulated by the constant flashing lights that I could not enjoy the film. I was having to watch through my fingers. I don't understand why they decided to make 80% of the film a jolting van gogh kaleidoscope, that feels like you're watching it all in VR. It felt as if the Visual Team wanted the entire film to mirror the feeling you get as you're going through the wormhole sequence in Doctor Strange, but for 2.5hrs. Kinda feels Ableist to be honest. I could not enjoy the film, it was torturous. I am deeply saddened by just how flashy the film was. Also, what was the message of the film? Parenting is hard and it's ok to be selfish to get what you desire, regardless of consequences? I'm really confused by the high scores. I consider myself to be a cinephile, with having seen thousands of films and enjoying most all films, sometimes even bad ones. I am saddened to say that I am deeply in disagreement with the 9.1 current rating and 90% rotten, it makes no sense to me at all. This film was so over produced that it made my head physically hurt. Sony, maybe try and be less ableist when you're thinking about creating 2hrs of strobe light animation; it didn't need the consistent glitching, pulsating, and flashing mechanic to the multi-layered animation styles.It honestly felt expensive, but overall just lazy.Really disappointed.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","cedricdumler","5 June 2023","Wow. An already great year for movies, just got extended by a masterpiece of filmmaking.Just as Into the Spider-Verse did before it, Across the Spider-Verse uses the audience's familiarity with Spider-Man as a consistent source of humor which makes it all flow flawlessly.I am quite frankly obsessed with this movie. There are six different animation styles featured in the film - and my goodness this is the most awe-inspiring animation I've ever seen in a film. Using stunning visuals as a way to elevate the emotion and action in every scene. Never seen the like. The voice acting is sublime (the dialogue between Miles and Gwen goes right under the skin), the characters are multi-faceted, the action sequences are electric, the music is mesmerizing and, my word, the storyline is the perfect balance of emotional depth and meticulously timed comic relief.I also love how Across the Spider-Verse balances setting up a sequel while being its own movie. Miles and Gwen have tidy and concluding arcs with enormous growth, as it still ends on a true cliffhanger. It's among the best part ones I've ever seen.This movie is pure art put on canvas, with every frame. Soulfull. A genuine love letter to Spider-Man and filmmaking itself.Note:
It's time for everyone to appreciate animated film as a true film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly demonstrates that you can't achieve and convey the same with a live-action film as with an animated film. The richness of emotions that this masterpiece conveys benefits greatly from the animation and its mesmerizing style.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","nicolepa05","11 July 2023","Seen on June 3, 2023 (most of the review is written based on the Latin dubbing of it, because of that, I'm from Argentina).I saw it at the cinema last weekend, and I can only say one thing, it's beautiful... it's that, god, it's great, like, with the style and quality of the animation Sony keeps surprising me more and more, apart from that, the styles, my god, there's a mixture of so many between the multiverse and the multiple realities of Spidey that it made me a little dizzy, but still, it looks beautiful.Aside from the humor, which I actually found quite funny in certain parts, and aside from another aspect, which is quite criticized, yeah, I'm talking about the dubbing... obviously I reject the idea that most of the dubbing is formed by Startalents from YT, Twitch, Tik Tok and all that, but in my honest opinion, yes, obviously I noticed a certain change, and I disliked some voices, but in itself the dubbing is not bad, it's like it just happened as the movie progressed. I didn't like Juan Guarnizo's voice too much, Pipe Punk's a little bit yes, and I had even read that the youtuber Jugando con Natalia (Juan Manuel Paradiso) had participated in the Latin dubbing, if you can tell me which character he dubbed, I would be very grateful, even being the most attentive, I still can't figure out which character he dubbed his voice to.Besides, I have to admit that I didn't watch ""Into the Spider-Verse"", only several clips, although I still managed to understand the movie and the story.God, when I saw the ending I was left with all the intrigue in the world, and I was like well, let's wait until next year when they release part 2, there's no other way...","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","akseliiikonen","1 June 2023","I had decently big expectations for this one, especially for a spider man movie, but rarely any of them were filled.I don't know how people find this movie that great, i just find it an ok movie with an ok plot. I definitely saw a lot of potential, but the plot was too overwhelming with so many things in the background. Main thing that i didn't like was the lack of action. I went to watch this movie to see a great plot, and a ton of action, but that certainly didn't happen.The first 40 minutes of the movie covers just the main characters which i found pretty boring. Rest of the movie was just 20 things happening at the same time. I felt like falling asleep halfway through, but luckilt at least there was some action.Definitely an ""Avengers: infinity war"" try, but lacks action. 7/10 at most.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","wesleyarledge-86836","22 July 2023","Next to Spider-Man: No Way Home, Across the Spider-Verse takes the top spot as the best Spidey film I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing! It is incredible, a feast for the eyes, and full of humor and heart! There are so many Easter Eggs to spot throughout the movie, and it is so much fun to try to spot them, you never know what, or WHO might pop up in the story! üëÄThis ambitious sequel delves heavily into the Spider-Man mythos, and continues the story of Miles Morales Spider-Man from the Into the Spider-Verse film, but it adds more depth to some other characters that we fell in love with in the first film while introducing some other Spider-powered people. This time, they're on a mission to stop the destruction of the multiverse, by a madman known only as The Spot, who can portal in and out of the different universes within the Spider-Verse on a mission to destroy all Spiders! That's not all though, as the leader of the Spider team, Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara) comes into conflict with Miles about his place in the Spider-Verse and what it truly means to be Spider-man!Featuring a massive voice cast including Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Jason Schwartzman, Karan Soni, Daniel Kaluuya, Oscar Isaac, Greta Lee, Mahershala Ali, Andy Samberg, Rachel Dratch, Zoe Kravitz, and many many, many more, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse does truly deliver!

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jaspercobar","25 June 2023","Spider Man across the spider verse was nearly perfect. The only flaw was the ending. It did rap up well though. Gwen assembled a Spider Man team to find Miles, Miles went to a universe were his uncle was still alive, and that Miles was the Prowler. So it really did get me excited for the next one, but at the same time I was pissed off that I have to wait another year to see it. It was a cliffhanger, but a good one. The ending could of been worse though, because I thought it was going to end with the Spot arriving in Gwen's current universe, and start attacking Miles's Dad. Just imagine that cliffhanger. Other then the ending, the movie was perfect. It had an amazing soundtrack, amazing action, amazing comedy. Amazing acting. The best part though was the small cameos, e.g when it showed the lady from the dairy in Venom, and Donald Glover as the Prowler. I'd recommend this movie, but not for little kids, because the plot is to confusing. It involves a lot of multiverse madness, that you really have to pay attention in order to understand.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ryanwesthamfan","3 June 2023","Quite simply perfection. This movie does not disappoint whatsoever. I've been hyped for this film ever since that first trailer dropped and it was worth the wait. The visuals are even better than the first one (which I didn't think was even possible) it is quite simply a groundbreaking film and the way that it is able to explore spider man in a way you can only do in animation. It is very rare you get sequels these days that are able to be even better than the original but this film definitely does that.Overall Thoughts- This film is a much watch. Stop what you're doing right now go to the cinema and watch this film because it is a masterpiece in every single way and I think I will only love this film even more on rewatch. Overall I'm going to give Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse an easy 10/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","tink-28108","29 June 2023","I loved it. From start to finish and the music. It's art really. It had really cool twists that I did not see coming (and I'm usually really good at calling those). It also has some great cameos and Easter eggs in it that I was excited to see. It does say ass quite a bit. Probably at least 3 or 4 times but that's it. We took our school so it was hard to hear it over the kids. Meaning the cuss words are well placed. As a mom, the speech that Mile's mom gave had me tearing up. I also think it's something that my three year old would enjoy. So it's definitely family friendly (unless you're super strict about cuss words.)","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","crwnroyale","25 June 2023","This is a movie is a must watch after you see the first one. You will not be disappointed. Nicely made family movie. I also truly enjoyed that I didn't notice any subliminal targeting of sexuality. Miles is still trying to grown into himself and figure out who he is. He is a smart young man but struggles with balancing life as hero, student, and a son. This movie has some classic throwback moments that links it to other spider-man movies.You will be drawn into the movie quick and begging for more. It was very funny noticing that Miles isn't the only spider-man that tries to disguise their true voice when talking to family.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","OldMovieRob","7 January 2024","Couldn't get into this one. It drags and meanders and maybe I'm just getting old but visually everything seems choppy, flashing and hard to follow. The story seems a over the place as well with far too many characters with stories going on, which seems to be how Marvel is going with the last few of their films I've seen. The sassy, i-know-more-than-you attitude of the female characters also gets a little tedious after awhile. I guess thr main thing is, I don't follow also why they had to retell Spiderman and not just roll out a new character, since this feels like a completely different character in a completely different universe. Well, whatever.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","chapterfourax","14 July 2023","The amount of work put into small details fro
the animators in this is spectacular.The way that Miles is animated at a slower fps when he's still learning to control his powers to the faster fps when he embraces them is a great example of visual story telling.To the way that he moves in the streets of the city listening to his music and putting stickers up while he is in his comfort zone to the duality of when he enters the new school for the first time and is overwhelmed and stumbling overhimself uncomfortable.A really amazing story as well about pushing yourself past your limits and that all it takes is ""a leap of faith"". Further symbolized by Miles pushing away from the mirror and breaking it when he makes his first jump in suit, showing despite him not being ready yet he forces and pushes himself to be.","10/10"

His expression was one of pure joy and utterly caught up in the story.Even is amped up, the range of art styles, the range of spider-people, the depth of story, performances. Everything is divine.Picking up with Gwen, lost and out of focus, missing Miles who is letting spider work take over school.Obviously they meet up and the fun kicks up. But when I say everything works it does. The laughs from Miles parents, the loss the Gwen's father for his lost daughter.The music is a perfect fit again.

After watching Across the Spider-Verse, I can easily say that this movie was phenomenal in every way possible from beginning to end. It's easily my 2nd favorite Spider-Man Movie just behind Spider-Man 2 (2004). I can honestly say that if Beyond the Spider-Verse is just as phenomenal or even better than this movie, then the Spider-Verse Trilogy will forever go down in history as one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history. This movie is absolutely a must watch for both Superhero & Animated movie fans.A Perfect 10/10!!!!!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","shubhampatelspam","16 June 2023","A complete pack of plot twists, humor, emotions, action, and amazing characters. Everything about this movie is just great. The animations, as usual, are mind-blowing and, I think, better than the first Spider Verse movie. The movie ends with the perfect cliffhanger. Even if you haven't watched any of the other Marvel movies, this one would blow your mind. However, having some knowledge about the MCU and knowing what happened in the first movie would help enhance the experience, as the other spiderman movies, starting from Tobey Maguire to Tom Holland, just gives one a perspective of the big picture and how everything connects. After Endgame, Marvel movies started going downhill and most fans, including myself, don't like it as much as the movies before. This movie, although not part of the actual MCU, has reignited my interest for Marvel movies and I am sure the next movie would be the same.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","nolansmith-70429","6 June 2023","I think this is actual cinema perfection. No joke, this movie has all of it. Insane plot and insane execution. The animation is a great to even view and it dazzles you every second of the way. Being an enormous fan of the 1st (#1 favorite movie of all time) this topped it. This is my new favorite movie of all time. The ending with Miles turning out to be the prowler in his dedicated universe had my jaw on the floor all the way home. This is one of the best movies created and it is this generations The Dark Knight and The Shawshank Redemption. I'm so excited for Part 2 and I want to say from the bottom of my heart, this is the best movie Marvel has ever made.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","alexaquarius","11 June 2023","Miles Morales did gave a great show this time in this movie. The way the story line goes is just breathtaking. Multiverse have already given Marvel infinite options to go with , In this movie they have utilized it wisely. As an Indian I am hyped to see Pavitr Prabhakar in this movie. He also spiced things up in the movie. Miguel O'Hara also known as the Spiderman 2099 made lots of impact in the movie. As the movie progressed more and more suspense was revealed which were all goosebumps moments, especially the climax. Earth 42 is going to offer lot more in the next movie and I am so excited to watch it. Love the whole movie , eagerly waiting for spiderman beyond the spider verse. Hope the next movie will be a Blast.","9/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","calebbrookscj","8 June 2023","Over many years, sequels have been known to sweep Hollywood off its feet. Making films like Empire strikes back and Top Gun Maverick which were absolutely superior to their predecessors in every way. Now Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse does that absolute feat after the audience patiently awaited for Miles Morales's return to the big screen after 5 years. Every single member of the Animation team poured their heart and soul's into each individual design for not only the locations but also each individual character. Even with this film being one piece of the pie, it is quite delectable in every way.Person note: In 2018,I experienced Miles Morales's origin for the first time when i watched Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse at the Cinemark Theater, which in all honesty became one of my favorite films of all time. It's animation was one of the most unique styles that I had laid my eyes on at the time. The use of a multiverse gave a perfect blend of characters to help Miles story grow. So after the film gained it's successful stardom, the announcement of a two parted sequel hit the internet by a storm of support, which is particularly the best reaction the internet could give. No one could comprehend how remarkable it would become.Across the Spider-Verse is what would be regarded as a Spider-Man fans dream film. It not only respects the source material given from the films, games and comics but it also gives a compelling story that everyone will love and isn't dragged by it's sheer amount of cameos. The easter eggs and references that are incorporated into the film are used very well and will in all honesty blow the audience's minds.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","monuthube","1 July 2023","Yeah, watched it finally. I mean seriously, I'm following a lot of industry artists (intentionally) on Insta and LinkedIn. And I started getting the posts of artists who were involved in making this film, and the day it was officially released, all my Insta and LinkedIn feeds flooded with behind-the-scenes shots that artists worked on. My god, it freaking huge... Every morning I opened Insta or LinkedIn, there were artist posts everywhere and it happened for 3-4 days üò±. Then there I read the news that this movie had the highest number of production crews both 3D & 2D, working simultaneously ü§ê.Looks like I need to update my favorite animated movie list, previously it was 'Into the Spider-verse', because of the story, animation, and music. Post Malone's Sunflower is still my phone ringtone for 5 years, which reminds me of the movie which is special to me and now definitely, it's 'Across the Spider-verse'. But, still, wait for it, this was just part 1 of a full sequel story... I'm super-damn-excited for 'Beyond the Spider-verse'.This time I watched the movie in the theatre, aka big screen. So, imagine how it was, the cityscape, duh and the conversion of Gwen and Miles, at the same time, this is what the best composition is! That whole scene was romantic and breathtaking. It's just too huge to save at once in my brain. And what the hell, the story, it's just so beautiful with the background music, it's still not high as the first movie (for me) but still it's best than any other which builds the moments you fall in love and become part of the story. Other than Miles and Gwen, Oscar Isaac's Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 is a totally different highlight of the movie, his presence sets the tense and wild mood in every scene. I mean second half is where the movie gets high on adrenaline rush, the wildness of Miguel O'Hara and the background music, sets everything on fire. And wait, if you imagine this as a complete movie then let me tell you as per story structure it was just the middle part (2nd act of 3 Act story structure), the real climax is yet to be witnessed in 'Beyond the Spider-verse'. The end part of the movie... Ho-oh, that was damn-freaking tense and unexpected (I mean it was not that difficult to guess) but I figured out the problem, that everyone faces in the multiversal stories concepts, is just that min blowing. But the way it was built up to this was like, something unbelievable.Talking about animation, I don't need to tell you... you just need to watch this movie because this is the peak of animation (I think so), how can we measure the creativity? Every single world and character had a different art style, imagine it... How crazy can creativity can go. I loved Gwen's world which had an art style of watercolors, it changed with the mood of the story and that was just another level of beauty.I personally enjoyed this movie deep down to my heart, because it just so f*kn' from all sides, its story is amazing, the animation is at just a different level, and dialogues-drama is beautiful. The reference to pop-cultural and real-life references, I mean when did you laugh openly (deep from your heart) while watching the movie? I mean it was a total roller coaster ride, from happy-joyful moments to sad-tensed moments. And Gwen & Miles's romance is just so beautiful with that cityscape, you'll fall in love with the movie. And another thing that stands out is the scene composition, I mean really every scene is so f*kn' beautiful, I can't just process it (it happened to me while watching Avatar: Way of Water), I say this is as eyes getting orgasm.The thing is, Miles's character is so relatable to youngsters like us, that you understand his pov. I just wish not to cut the movie here, I mean it could have been more better if part two was added to this aka making it a 4-hour movie, and Gwen's taking the lead in the end was another best thing (from scene composition pov). There are so many things I want to talk about because I'm in love with this movie.I definitely-x-infinity will recommend this movie, to see what the best-est animated movie looks like, there are literally no flaws. It's all-round PERFECT in a big-bold, movie.If you hadn't watched the 'Into the Spider-verse' then start from there it's available on both Netflix and Amazon, then if possible enjoy 'Across the Spider-verse' on a big screen, just to feel the quality of the scenes.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","No-Life-101","10 August 2023","I finally got around to watching Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse and I'm so happy that I did, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and know I'll be rewatching it soon. I managed to avoid spoilers for this movie and I'm so happy that I did because I went in not knowing anything besides information from the previous movie. This movie starts by giving us Gwen's backstory which I found heartbreaking, the visuals were strong and the music added to the story and then from there we go back to Miles which the story focuses on. I like the subtle detail of the music changing depending on what dimension they're in and who's involved, I also loved the themes being incorporated into the music too.The character introductions were amazing, funny, and unique to every spider person, I love how they animated everyone differently depending on what dimension they came from to show that difference. Also, their designs! I'm in love with them all, they're so detailed, it almost leaves me speechless. As well as I love how everyone interacts with their environment, they see things from unique perspectives and move in such bouncy ways that it looks natural for anybody to do, but I know that if I tried to move the way they did I'd pull something. But this detail especially shows during action scenes, they make the world seem bigger, and they make the fights engaging and fun to watch.Storywise, I loved the comedy and found myself laughing at the jokes and how the characters interacted. I loved the natural mix of different languages and when the characters were speaking in their native language I felt like that was just between characters and not really for the audience to understand what's being said but how it's being said. Also, the visual details of character growth since the previous movie, Miles grew, Gwen grew and her hair got longer, it makes it seem like just because we don't see the characters their lives are still ongoing. I also loved the connection between Miles and the villain, it calls back to the previous movie.Overall, this movie is not only visually appealing but emotional too. The music is powerful, and the story is engaging and at times funny too. I did not see that plot twist ending though, but it makes me excited to see another movie!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","GhostFoxX","17 June 2023","This is not just a film. It's an emotion, an experience.Coherent storytelling. Amazing characters, each with perfect design. The entire animation style is revolutionary, I don't think I've ever seen anything like it before. Pair all these up with soundtracks that if called masterpieces, would be understated. Each of the soundtracks are so good that you'd really find a hard time choosing the best one. Not to mention the perfect timing to utilize the soundtracks so that you get the best possible experience on the theatre.Honestly man, I thought its predecessor already set the bar too high, and it won't be able to cross that. But I got to tell you, I was wrong.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","speedycomics","10 August 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute triumph in the world of animated superhero films. As a huge fan of the first Spider-Verse movie, my expectations were sky-high, and I am thrilled to say that this sequel not only met but exceeded them. From start to finish, it was a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that left me on the edge of my seat.One of the standout aspects of this film is its animation style. The combination of traditional hand-drawn animation with cutting-edge CGI creates a unique and vibrant visual experience. The attention to detail is impeccable, with every frame bursting with color and energy. The action sequences are mind-blowing, with the characters leaping off the screen and swinging through the city with incredible fluidity. It truly feels like a comic book come to life.The story takes place after the events of the first film, and it delves deeper into the multiverse concept. Miles Morales, the young Spider-Man, embarks on a journey across different dimensions, encountering various versions of Spider-Man along the way. The narrative is engaging and keeps you hooked from start to finish. It seamlessly blends humor, heart, and high-stakes action, making for a well-rounded and satisfying experience.The voice acting is top-notch, with Shameik Moore reprising his role as Miles Morales. He brings a youthful energy and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and likable. The supporting cast, including Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy and Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, also deliver fantastic performances, adding depth and humor to their respective roles.What sets this film apart is its ability to tackle complex themes and emotions. It explores the idea of identity, the weight of responsibility, and the importance of family and friendship. These themes are handled with care and resonate on a deep level, making the characters feel more human and relatable.If I had to nitpick, there were a few moments where the pacing felt slightly rushed, and some characters could have been given more screen time. However, these minor flaws do not detract from the overall excellence of the film.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for any fan of the superhero genre. It is a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that will leave you wanting more. With its incredible animation, engaging story, and memorable characters, it deserves a solid 9 out of 10. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the Spider-Verse franchise.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","TheRealPetraeus","3 June 2023","An unparalleled feat in the animation genre and cinema as a whole. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece and everything a Spider-Man fan would want. Truly a masterclass in juggling plentiful references, amazing character moments, an interesting and well thought-out story, mesmerizing action sequences, and an incredibly memorable soundtrack. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse handles all of this, along with the best animation that has graced the film industry. The different styles of each world and character mesh with each other so smoothly, it leads to every frame being pure eye-candy.While the breakneck pacing, frantic action sequences, and immensely colorful animation can lead to some viewers feeling overwhelmed (me included), those same viewers will find themselves ready to roll into the sequel once the credits start to roll. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse uses animation to convey so much emotion, which is incredibly difficult to do in the live-action medium. Even though this movie is still a kids movie, the story becomes so much darker and more emotional than I expected. Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse was much more mature than your average kids movie, but this is able to crank the maturity up a notch, but still maintains a fun atmosphere.The comedy is also genuinely great, and manages to be leagues funnier than your average comedy show such as Family Guy . The banter and dialogue between the characters is so natural and well-written that the slowest parts of the movie are still incredibly entertaining. Each bit of long running dialogue has so many hints and jokes throughout, that the chance of your brain processing all of them in a single watch is unlikely. This also applies to the bountiful amount of references in the background of so many different shots. The soundtrack is also just perfect, and is filled with very memorable tracks.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is just perfection. Is it better than its predecessor? No doubt, and that's coming from someone who believes Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is perfect. Yes, they somehow made a movie better than literal perfection. I can't wait for the conclusion to these two cinematic masterpieces and I have no doubt that they will stick the landing. There is so much to love in this movie, that I doubt I could cover everything in a single review. I believe Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has solidified itself as the best Spider-Man film, the best superhero film, and quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever made.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","leekeithf","9 September 2023","Absolute cracker of a film! Forget that it's animated, it is a film and first rate at that. The animation is out of this world, the music amazing, the story top notch and script superb. It's not often you get everything just right, but this surpasses getting it right; it's an amazing film. Even the Brit-Punk Spiderman, they got it spot on. The humour is also good and pitched at the right level, even having an apt joke about the villain talking about holes. The characters were well thought out, the dialogue was appropriate and well written. In fact, my son & I cannot criticise any of it. It's on par with the Christopher Nolan Batman films. If they could apply this level to something like DC's Injustice it would be brill. I am so glad I watched it and it's part of a 3 piece story, not just a sequel because it will make money. The story is coherent and sound and the level of research that has gone into getting it right has worked. I cannot praise it enough.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Xstal","4 June 2023","Times moved on since the adventures with your brethren, and life doesn't seem to be just quite as much fun, but a visit from Gwen Stacy, escalates things to quite racy, as you enter other worlds, and start to run; after coming face to face with angry Spot, who's more than capable, of tying knots (especially of himself), but it's revenge that he desires, and now he's pulling all the wires, and the canon has misfired its latest shot; into worlds of masks and costumes that astound, with variations on the theme that just dumbfound, a kaleidoscope of dazzle, of electrifying frazzle, as you leave you just can't wait for the next round.It's just a bit spectacular.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","dcdude-26988","3 June 2023","This has to be a top three movie/film for me personally. Just let me explain why before you are gonna go like, ""Top 3?!"". The whole movie literally explains in every reason why most Spider-Men in different demensions have the same exact storyline and background stories. A spiderman gets bit, falls in love, and then has a loved one die. That is what happens in every Spider-Man story, and this film literally explains it to us all. Not to mention, the whole storyline about Gwen relates to as of why she cares about Miles alot. Anyways, the animation has to be some of the best animation that we have seen so far, and the visuals were amazing as well. The film is kind of mind controlable at the same time, and here is why before you ask. At first, the movie was like, ""Why are you showing all of this so slowly"", but then, at some of the ending parts, it literally explains why they were. Speaking of ending parts, the plot twists were amazing as well. Some of them are like, ""oh, I get it"", and others were like ""WHAT?!"", which means that this movie was able to balance it very well. In my opinion, I think that this and the previous represent and show how the multiverse works alot better than the Marvel Cinematic Universe has ever done.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","hoshouchian","5 June 2023","I don't even know where to start. I already had unhealthy high expectations for this movie, yet it still exceeded those expectations far beyond reach. It lives up to its title by plunging us right back into the chaotic madness of the multiverse by delving into Gwen's perspective, exploring her dynamics with her family and the hardships that come with juggling two different identities while not letting either one overlap or dominate. The Gwen-centered prologue spans for a whopping 15 minutes. It chronicled everything from dramatic character-affirming moments and extravagant artistic expression to mesmerisingly fluid action sequences and laugh-out-loud snippets of levity. It's basically a microcosm of what we are about to expect from the remaining runtime, giving us just a taste of the absolute carnage that is bound to unfold. And my god, did this movie deliver!This sequel stands tall alongside Empire Strikes Back and Judgment Day as one of the worthiest successors of a pre-established masterpiece. But it's not only a masterpiece, it's a true work of art. It lies one step above masterpiece. It's a Renaissance painting come to life. You can just randomly pause at a scene and take a screenshot and it'll be a beautiful wallpaper. I thought Into The Spider-Verse was the pinnacle of superhero storytelling. Man, I was never this wrong. I'm telling you this blows Into The Spider-Verse out of the freaking water. It not only reaches new heights. It tears up the sky and shoots you beyond the stratosphere. I am shocked to the core at how revolutionary this movie is. I have never seen anything like it. The experience I had in the cinema is nothing short of spellbinding. This movie had me strapped on tight in my seat right from the get go, then had me in a suffocating stranglehold, refusing to loosen its grip, let alone let go, and throttled me towards a rollercoaster ride of emotions and feelings, I don't even know how to react.This is a mindblowing experience that left me speechless at times, laughing for the most part, and utterly petrified by its closing hour. My eyes were glued to the screen for the entire time, I never felt the 2-hour-and-20-minute runtime and it felt like I was right there beside the characters. My jaw was wide open the entire time, I could not believe what I was being exposed to. And I thought watching Infinity War and Endgame was the high point of my moviegoing experience. No, this is not only a cinematic experience I will never forget. This is something else entirely. This is something special. This is a cinematic miracle. The fact that they pulled this off with flying colours is insane. Everybody is firing on all cylinders. From the seamless blend of countless different animation styles, the striking colours, the stark contrasts, to the deliberate compositions, this is a visual feast unlike any other. This is a textbook testament to the creative potential of animation. There can be a scene with two people talking, and the background is filled with so much detail. Every single frame, shot and sequence is meticulously devised and painstakingly choreographed. It's lively, it's dynamic, it's moving.And amidst the dizzying array of visual cacophony lies a story that chronicles what it means to be Spider-Man. Again Miles (alongside his fellow Spider-companions) is flung head-first into wave after wave of emotional peril, exploring themes of adolescent isolation, complexities of growing up, and finding where he belongs in this vast expanse of multiversal entropy. He is put in situations that tests his resolve and integrity as a human being and as a universe-hopping superhero, clashing with different Spider-people when they present conflicting ideologies. And the way the creative team executed these moral dilemmas is nothing short of intelligent and mature by not giving us any easy or simple answers, but making us question along with the characters what the right decision is and what we would do if we are in their shoes.Not to mention, The Spot turned out to be one of most menacing villains ever to have graced the silver screen. He started out as a goofy ""villain of the week"", but then more layers get peeled off and we get to witness this 3-dimensional sculpture of a misunderstood and unfortunate guy sucked into the wrong end of a calamity. They actually made us care and understand where he's coming from, why he is the way he is, and why he's doing what he's doing. And the new Spider-people all have distinct personalities and some of them get to really shine under the spotlight. The core of the story doesn't ever get lost amidst the wild collection of cameos and Easter eggs. The team behind this franchise show that they have formed a tightly-knit kinship about what they are cooking up and what kind of a story they are trying to tell.Also, when the action settles down, the dust clears and the superheroes take off their costumes, the movie does not get less interesting. This is a grounded drama as much as it is a superhero spectacle. The dialogue in this movie is so sharp and witty, it cuts like a water jet. It takes what the first movie established and built upon that foundation by deepening the relationships of the characters and weaving more intricate elements into Miles' journey of self-discovery. And we get to just marvel at the complications and how it all plays out. Everything is laid bare. The characters are put front and center, flanked by breathtaking visual ingenuity, sharp sound design, powerful voice acting and Daniel Pemberton's sublime musical presentation.This sequel is more than a sequel. This is the best Spider-Man film ever made. This is the best superhero film ever made. This is the best animated film ever made. This is the best film of the year and possibly the best film to have come out in recent years. And it's not even close. It is a love letter to the Spider-Man canon, poking fun at familiar tropes but not forgetting to inject fresh oil to keep the engine purring. They went above and beyond for this. Every single aspect here screams perfection, from the calculated directing to the slick editing.There is not a single nanometre of a weak link. The web of life and destiny is woven with tour-de-force cinematic artistry. I am telling you that we are witnessing the birth of one of the greatest film trilogies ever made in cinematic history. I have no reason to doubt that Beyond The Spider-Verse is going to be as excellent as its era-defining predecessors. This is truly a flawless achievement that keeps you at the edge of your seat for the conclusion. See you next March!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Rectangular_businessman","30 June 2023","Does Across the Spider-Verse really deserves the rather impressive 8.9 score it currently holds here on the Internet Movie Database?I don't know, but I can tell I enjoyed a lot this film from beginning to end.Despite its unusual lenght, the movie never gets boring or tedious in any moment, keeping a frenetic pace in every single one of its scenes.Maybe the dialogue was a little bit too ""quippy"" in a couple of moments, but the snappy writing doesn't get in the way of the most dramatic moments, never lessening them in any manner.The animation deserves a particular mention, alternating in a rather different impressive manner several distinct visual styles, taking a full advantage of the medium in a way in which would be almost impossible to depict via live-action.This sequel lives up to the original, and left me with very high expectations towards its continuation.Now that the bar has been set up so high, I really hope the finale of the Spiderverse series doesn't disappoint.So far, the ride has been quite amazing.8.5/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","christianyogendran-15663","9 July 2023","I loved Into the Spider Verse, I seriously have no words to describe how spectacular Across the Spider Verse was! Somehow they managed to make the second movie better than the first!Every frame of the movie is basically a work of art. It can easily be put into an art museum. I also love how they were able to put different types of animation as well, from LEGO to non-cartoon, to comic-book.The acting is also amazing, Hailee Steinfeld actually has a bigger role in the movie and I'm so thankful that Gwen Stacy was given the emotional backstory we all wanted. The actor that plays the villain Spot is also really clever as well, but the real star of the movie is Oscar Issac. I loved his character the most, he plays his role with such passion that I've never seen from any actor. Honestly everyone did a great job at playing their roles, those three were the highlights. It wasn't like Quantamania where the acting was carried by Jonathan Majors only and the rest were really annoying.Overall, a must watch for anyone. The Spider Verse movies are meant to be directed towards kids, but honestly adults will love.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","TheDanielBaxter","9 August 2023","The plot is so tight, the animation is absolutely insane, I honestly have never seen a more incredible looking movie. On a technical and visual level, this film incorporates literally every style of animation and cinematography that is available. It is jaw dropping what has been achieved in this movie. The characters are brilliant, with perfectly selected voice actors to match.SONY really have achieved something unique here, and the animators should each be given their own award for the level of skill and attention to detail in this film.I have superhero fatigue and am tired of Multiverse plots. But all that goes out of the window, just for this film.A visual masterpiece. True art.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","CelluloidConnoisseur","3 June 2023","As an avid fan of the Spider-Verse franchise, I was eagerly awaiting the release of the highly anticipated sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Let me tell you, this film did not disappoint. In fact, I dare say it surpassed its predecessor and established itself as a superior film.One of the most remarkable aspects of Across the Spider-Verse is its stunning visuals. The film seamlessly incorporates various forms of animation, creating a visually breathtaking spectacle. Every frame is a work of art, and the animation is so daring and innovative that even the simplest dialogue scenes are elevated to new heights.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance its visual extravaganza with a smart, character-driven story. It explores themes of fate, friendship, and the sacrifices heroes must make. The joy of discovery and emotional generosity, which were the soul of the original Into the Spider-Verse, are still present in abundance. The film manages to be inventive, thrilling, funny, ridiculous, heartwarming, frenetic, and even sad, all at once.Across the Spider-Verse also deserves praise for its willingness to entrust its storytelling to its animation. The visuals not only enhance the story but become an integral part of it, propelling the narrative forward in unexpected ways. The film takes risks, and they pay off splendidly.The movie's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers yearning for more, and it's a bittersweet realization that we'll have to wait until March 2024 for the conclusion. Nonetheless, this film stands on its own as an instant classic. It maintains the whimsical energy of its predecessor while offering a fresh perspective with a slightly different writing lineup.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates exceptional storytelling and groundbreaking animation. It raises the bar for animated films and leaves a lasting impression with its thrilling action, engaging characters, and visual splendor. This is a cinematic experience that should not be missed.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ahmadmobeenqazi","31 May 2023","I was fortune enough to attend the premiere here in Singapore. A non-spoiler review follows:Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse does more than just swing into action; it weaves a narrative tapestry with passion, dedication, and love. The creators of this epic journey have clearly poured their heart and soul into every frame, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.The animation is a tour de force, seamlessly blending diverse art styles that bring the Spider-Verse to life in a way that feels vibrant and fresh. Each scene is a feast for the eyes, painting the screen with a burst of colors and imaginative designs that will leave you breathless.Equally commendable is the strength of the narrative that effortlessly connects with the audience. The story doesn't just unfold; it entangles you in its web, ensuring that you are invested in every dramatic interaction, every thrilling fight sequence, and every emotional climax.Character development is another highlight of the film. The growth our beloved characters undergo adds layers of depth to the story, making their journeys all the more engaging. Their interactions, whether action-packed or heartwarming, are captivating and contribute greatly to the film's overall quality.The score and soundtrack are also nothing short of fire, underscoring every moment with tunes that not only set the mood but also elevate the story to new heights.However, if I absolutely have to nitpick, there are a few moments when it seems to pull on the heartstrings a tad excessively. This slight overindulgence in sentimentality is a small nitpick in an otherwise excellent film.The way the Spider-Verse is portrayed, introduced, and expanded feels effortless and organic. You get a sense of a larger universe out there, waiting to be explored, which adds to the anticipation for the next part in this thrilling saga.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning and an emotionally gripping adventure. I, for one, can't wait to see where this journey takes us next.","10/10"

This is my Empire Strikes back, my Infinity War. Planning on seeing it again multiple times. See it on the best screen possible. I love Miles and Gwen's relationship.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","stedz-29848","27 December 2023","Normally I'd round 6.5 up to a 7 but I'd begrudge doing so for this fare. The art style blew me away in the first one and it's pretty good here but not good enough for a free pass. I don't know why they had to make it so long for it to end on a ""TBC"". For me it sums up how I feel about this movie that I don't even care how this finishes, sure I'll probably watch the sequel at some point on a Sunday afternoon. The villain is hardly in the movie and it's just expecting me to sit back and enjoy the various settings and characters, which if this was the first film in this style would be enough. Glad I didn't fall for the hype and spend money at the cinema.","10/10"

I dont know if this story is completely original or they are following comic material, but its brilliant and ties in to the first movie. Frankly it feels more like one long story broken down into three parts, and we're smack right in the centre. The finale chapter is gonna be brilliant.Animation is returning to the spotlight.

However, it definitely met or even surpassed my expectations. In my opinion, Spider-Verse 2 is undoubtedly a worthy successor to the first film. In fact, I believe that it's one of the best animated movies of 2023 - if not of all time.Oh and also, it's full of little hidden details and Easter eggs! I can't wait to watch it again and try to Spot more of them (pun intended).Everyone who worked on this film did an outstanding job and deserves more praise. Just incredible.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","lepetitdj","5 June 2023","OK, this is not so original to say that this animation flick is a masterpiece. There must be several other users that say the same thing as I am saying.But the reason is simple: it's because it truly is!This movie left me overexcited for the last one of the trilogy. I felt like a little boy that had the best chocolate on the planet and was told that there will be more of it if I can wait until the next batch is ready. The animation is tip-top, the characters are deep and likeable, the story is fresh (relatively to the multi-verse mania that has been running the theaters lately), the action scenes are over the top and easy to follow, the epicness of the situation is increasing as the movie goes and many jokes are really funny (sometimes simple but they work in their simplicity because you let yourself go with the general mood of the film).Spiderman fans will have what they are looking for and newcomers will just have an insane experience of colors, beauty, action and emotions that very few movies are able to give, with a real message and deep thoughts about the multi-verse, destiny/determinism, family and responsibilities.So, dare I say it: this is the best movie of 2023 so far, the best animation movie of all time and one of the best films of all time, period. Just go watch it!","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","classicsoncall","21 October 2023","When I first watched and reviewed ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", it ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Movies of All Time. It now sits at #67 as I write this. At the time, I thought the film was OK, not great, but OK. As far as animated movies go, I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright, vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters. Regarding the story however, it wasn't particularly new or innovative. How many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? This one, if I can make a timely comparison, might have been titled ""Spider-Man: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"". That comes with the territory of taking place in a multiverse, where just about anyone and anything goes. It's just a little bit too much in my estimation, making the story somewhat confusing and disjointed, perhaps perfect for the attention deficit generation, but unappealing to someone my age who grew up on the very early Spider-Man stories. There's some nod to that era, with a brief glance of an 'Amazing Fantasy #15' comic book cover, along with various other covers appearing in too rapid succession to focus on their relevance. Another turn off for me was the clich√©d dialog that took place throughout the story, with phrases like 'been there, done that', 'wait, what?', and the ever-popular turn of phrase, 'are you serious, right now'. It all made for a direct appeal to an under twenty-five-year-old audience, nothing wrong with that, but with limited appeal to someone who's outgrown their teen years. At present, the movie ranks #22 on IMDb's Top 250. I think it hit as high as #11 when I was following it when it came out. That's higher than its predecessor, and will probably remain that way as both progress down the chart over time. The fact that it was not a done in one film was also a mild annoyance, particularly since it didn't recommend to me that I had to catch the next installment, considering the disorderly course of this one.","9/10"

There are some logical flaws which will appear during the viewing, nonetheless the animation is impeccable and how the story goes is also great. Recommendation without hesitation.On a side node: This is how you make poc people being represented well. Not randomly switching skin colors, but making great characters of their own. At this point Morales is literally edging on the popularity of Peter Parker. Just make cool characters!If you're unsure; Watch it.","9/10"

There doesn't need to be conclusion to a film to enjoy it and have fun.

It's like Toy Story where you are in awe of the visual presentation. People like me appreciate when you can see the heart and hard work on the screen. Apparently some studios believe throwing absurd amounts of üí∏ at the production crew and a good movie will just suddenly appear. When you hire artists with a vision and a passion to inspire the crew to believe in the magic being conjured, then a quality film appears.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","JWick23","23 August 2023","Story: 8.5The story was kind of going all over the place at first but slowly connecting with one another down the line. It was very detailed with alot of meanings and purpose in the different scenes of the movie.Characters: 8Alot of new characters in this movie except most of them
were lacking in quality except for a few newly introduced characters and the characters from the first movie.Visuals/Music: 10I mean do I really have to say anything. The song selections were fantastic and really matched the atmosphere of the scenes in the movie and the visuals were so dynamic and powerful to capture different imagery and depth. The visuals and song selections were simply top tier.Overall quite an enjoyable movie.Memorable: Sort of, Rewatchable: Maybe.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","yeswestan","25 August 2023","I was a HUGE fan of the first movie. I went into it expecting the multiple spider-people to be confusing and overwhelming and left the theatre a new person. I bought the art book. I studied the style. I wrote about this franchise in my college application essays.And to now see that the animation has only improved just blows me away. I see how the filmmakers adapted the praise and excitement about the animation and colors and cranked it up; this movie is somehow more beautiful than the last. The comedy is excellent. The soundtrack is engaging and creative. The cast of characters and background spider-people only drive the point further that anyone can be spider-man with the level of diversity among them. The writing and dialogue is just amazing, the cast is wonderful, and the conflict feels real and devastating.The only real negatives I can think of are that it was kind of a lot/messy, and it sucks that this movie was split into two; that makes it feel like the story was only just getting started before it suddenly stopped.This film truly shows what animation is capable of. All the elements come together so well.And lastly, I'm Indian. So seeing Pavitr Prabhakar on the big screen not only representing the Indian community, but also our culture in a way that was fun and relatable made me so happy. I understand that the movie serves more of a base-level view on Indian culture but seeing as the movie isn't really about that, I think they did a good job, especially with the entire Mumbattan environment. I loved every second of it. People don't realize how much representation matters. I'm grateful.","10/10"

Each character is intriguing and worth the building.The story is strong and it out does the original. The addition of Spiderman 2099; just genius.A fun ride from beginning to end, where everything is multidimensional and thought provoking.In a year blockbusters are rare, this is a pure pleasure for movie goers.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","carsonpayne-66437","3 June 2023","For only the 16th time ever, this movie gets a perfect 10/10 from me. How come? Without a doubt, Across the Spider-Verse has done something that is completely new and original while still be a sequel to a previous film.I can not imagine a single person going to see this movie and not absolutely loving it. First off, the movie is visually stunning. Each frame is a work of art while the film switches from art styles at rapid pace without distracting from the story in any way. The writers were much more bold and complex with the story this time around and it most definitely paid off. I was engaged in the storyline of every single character and could not stop imagining what a film about each person could be like. Finally, the sound was absolutely absurd! I could not believe at some points how fantastic the visuals and sound meshed together to bring the film to life.Across the Spider-Verse benefits heavily from its predecessor. With a lot less explaining needing to go on about character backstories, the whole film was an adventure and I am here for it. Even when things were needed to be explained, like the multiverse, it was done so beautifully and well. Easily the best multiverse movie that has come out and there have been many.Do yourself a favor and go watch this on the biggest screen near you. This is not something you want to miss seeing in theaters.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","samslapson","12 June 2023","This movie is genuinely the greatest Marvel Movie I've watched in a long time. Now, admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of marvel movies in general, but I do know that the ones that I've watched, couldn't even come close to the masterpiece that is this movie. The jokes were funny, the serious parts were amazing and made sense, and the designs of the characters are the most creative designs I've ever seen in any animated movie. The villain of the movie is also very interesting, and along with having a comedic backstory along with bouncing off of the rest of the spider-mens humor, is scary and serious. Amazing movie overall, and I'm very excited to see Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse Part 2.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","finnconnelly-63017","5 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse has done the impossible: be better than Into the Spider-Verse. And by leaps and bounds too. The animation is spectacular. Every frame looks like a Van Gogh, a Picasso. It makes Into the Spider-Verse look like a first grader painted it. The voice cast is very well done, Oscar Isaac, Haliee Steinfeld, and Andy Samberg are definite highlights. The action sequences are superb, but they complement a fantastic story that when its massive cliffhanger hits you, you'll be begging for more. Daniel Pemberton brings his A game once again with a score that's even better than the first. Across the Spider-Verse succeeds in every way, and should be seen on the biggest screen possible.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ruelshepperd","3 June 2023","Into The Spider-Verse was one of the best superhero movies and animated movies ever made, certainly the strongest Spider-Man movie we've had to date. Until now. Across The Spider-Verse takes all what was great about its predecessor and turns it up to 11, creating what is possibly the best animated movie ever.The animation in this film is next level. The style has evolved since the last film with not only the comic-style but many different styles encompassing different versions of Spider-Man and it all flows together marvellously. Every frame is literally an excellently constructed painting. This aids in the absolutely stunning and immensely creative action sequences, some of the best I've ever seen.The story is once again fantastic. With all this multiversal madness, the writers put Miles' story front and centre. His arc is remarkable and Shameik Moore continues to be the definitive version of the character. Every voice actor does an incredible job, especially Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Every moment of the pair together is wonderful. There is so much going on character-wise and Miles' personal journey has the potential to be the best Spider-Man story arc we've gotten in movie form.Being a big crossover, there are moments of fan service but they're never dwelt upon, the plot and characters remain the focus. If there were any problems to bring up it would be that the main antagonist for the first half of the film disappears for the rest of the film but the villain is still good and is clearly going to be more prevalent in the next film. There is still very strong emotional conflict without him as strong character ideals become the main source of conflict for the rest of the film.Overall, this film should be a 10/10 but because of its place as the first of a two-parter, the second part must stick the landing for it all to be worth it. However, I have immense faith in the filmmakers to pull it off because of the immense quality of this film. It exceeds in all aspects of filmmaking. A must-see for everyone!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","wilbertwwest","24 June 2023","Wow! Spiderman Across the Spider-verse is soooo much better than I expected. I loved the focus on family, relationships, multiple cultures, throwbacks to other Spiderman movies, some unpredictable twists, action, and the varying types of animation. Most superhero movies seem to be heavy on action and weak on character relationships so it was refreshing to see this movie firmly deliver in this area. I was skeptical at the 9/10 IMDB rating but, I was wrong for that. Its a 10/10!!! I was traveling when it came out and was disappointed to see it pulled feom the IMAX and Dolby Cinema screens after the first weekend. I was lucky to find one cinema on June 23.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Seb_3","9 December 2023","Another outstanding spectacle filled with depth, character building, emotion, while delivering top notch animation through the entire run time.It uses nostalgia and other funny quirks, for the viewers to take notice of and have a laugh at. Despite that it isn't driven by those aspects, but instead the characters and story. Where the first movie felt like a conclusive origin story about Miles Morales, this instead feels like an expansion of the universe and the beginning of a larger tale.In the end it feels very much like the first part of two, and I can't wait for the second half. That being said, the story still has a but not as conclusive as the first one. Its a bigger and more expansive story, about Miles' journey about what it means to be Spiderman and the responsibility that follows.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","boblipton","11 June 2023","Before I begin my review, WARNING! This is the first of a two-part movie. I don't mind two-parters, but I do resent finding out at the end.That said, when we begin this movie, we discover Miles Morales down in the dumps. True, he has just saved the multiverse, but he's a lonely neighborhood Spiderman, with his fellow spidermen (and women) off in their own versions of the Earth. However, when a villain called the Spot shows up, proclaiming himself Spiderman's nemesis, taking umbrage at being called the villain of the week, and Gwen Stacey's Spiderwoman shows up, Miles finds himself tagging along to discover a multiverse of Spidermen, Spiderwoman, Spidercats, Spiderbabies, and even a Spider Tyrannosaurus Rex, banded together to defend all reality.... and he's not welcome.Once again there are clever gags, every universe is drawn in a different style, and there is a clear metaphorical meaning to this: events may compel us into certain paths, making us seem no more than an expression of a trope, but who we are makes a difference in the outcome, too. The visual splendor of this movie makes it one you should see, if you are interested, in the theater. Even though I am annoyed at having a two-parter slipped past me without warning.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","xgpackerfan","8 June 2023","If you're going to create a trilogy the Spider-verse is heading to the right direction. The second part to the Spidey-Verse was beautifully crafted with mesmerizing animation effects and a fantastic screenplay. I don't want to give too much details because I don't want to play spoiler and second so much goes on into the film. You have to watch it twice. Whether you're a fan of Toby M, Andrew G, or Tom H Spider-Man's version. This Miles Morales version doesn't disappoint. As a fan of the cinematic world, it's not often an animated film gets high praise. However, Across the Spider-Verse, is a animated movie to be recognize.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Prismark10","21 October 2023","I admired Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I did not like it enough, it was not memorable enough and it was more interested in leaving it all to a sequel.Miles Morales has to deal with a villain called The Spot. He was an Alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during a collider explosion. He now blames Miles for his condition as he also brought a spider from another dimension that bit Miles, giving him spidey superpowers.Meanwhile Miles collides with Gwen Stacy, although she is from another dimension as well, where she is also Spider-Woman.In short Miles and Gwen as well as others chase the Spot through the multiverse. Only the Spot has plans of his own.The film starts off slowly, a crawl before getting supercharged. It just lacks the punch and effervescence of the first movie in this cartoon series.","8/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","eddie_baggins","1 June 2023","Not even the most optimistic of pundits could've ever predicted the glowing reception and success that came the way of 2018's Into the Spider-Verse, slinging to almost $400 million at the worldwide box office, critical praise and a spot entrenched in the upper echelons of the IMDB's Top 250 Movies of All Time list, too say that the first iteration of the Spider-Verse animated universe was a roaring and unexpected success would be a huge understatement.Fast forward these close to 5 years on and expectations for teenager Miles Morales/Spider-Man next adventure are sky high but proving that lightning can strike twice, the creative team behind this colourful Spider-Man series overseen by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have once again delivered a frenetic, energetic and most importantly entertaining animated epic that will likely cause much debate as to whether or not this is a case of a rare sequel that may in fact be better than its forefather.Still featuring the oddball humour and near endless parade of in-jokes, homages and side gags that made the first Morales venture such a delight outside of its visual spectacle, Across the Spider-Verse also feels like a much more mature outing this time around, with Morales himself more world weary and battered, coinciding with the film as a whole dealing with some heavy issues and subject matters that at times brings on an unexpectedly sombre tone, with credit going to the creative team here for not being afraid to make their film skew further from the young audience that may not quite understand the nuances on display here all the while allowing older audience members to feast on a film that is far from all style and no substance.Clocking in at close to two and a half hours, Across the Spider-Verse is one of the longest animated films ever widely released into cinemas and there are segments throughout the film where it feels as though we are covering off similar narrative ground on more than one occasion but when Morales adventure into the Multiverse swings into the sky it takes us on an often unforgettable journey, whether it be to a New York done the way of Mumbai or a Spider-filled version of Earth, Across the Spider-Verse has enough imagination and spark to fill countless other animated rides that would be desperate for even a portion of the creative magic on display here.As also was the case the first time around in 2018, this 2023 Spider-Verse features another array of on-song voice performances from its talented cast that works in tandem with the incredible artistry on display throughout, led once more by Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld, new additions to the voice cast here such as a scene-stealing Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara, Jason Schwartzman as The Spot or Daniel Kaluuya as Hobart Brown all bring their A-game to this big budgeted affair, making this an all-round package that has not only lived up to the legacy of the first instalment but arguably surpassed it.Even if there's a feeling of being teased by possibilities once the credits begin to roll here, the hype is going to be overflowing for next years Beyond the Spider-Verse which is setting out to prove that lightning can indeed strike more than twice.Final Say -People may bemoan the amount of Spider-Man themed films we've had slung our way over the past 20 years but if the quality of these outings remains as strong as what we get here with Across the Spider-Verse, they're going to be complaining for a long time yet to come.4 Chai tea's out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","10/10"

As I watched in the cinema, I got emotional of how beautiful this movie is. Everytime Gwen's storyline came up, I got goosebumps. The backgrounds fits every character perfectly. It's freaking funny, it's good for nerds and non-nerds, there's a lot of depth and emotion in it. Various life stages are touched in this movie. From teenager to parent. From puppy love to hardcore grief.When the movie ended the audience sighed. Nooo we want moooore. And I will wait patiently for more of this beautiful artpiece.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","kosmasp","3 June 2023","No puns intended - and yes it is plural! So many things that are touched upon .. same is true for the movie. There is so much, that watching this once is not enough. While it has been a while since I saw the first (or rather previous) movie, it is not entirely necessary to have seen it. On the other hand, you will have some callbacks, if you have seen it. Maybe even more if you watch them back to back.The character are well drawn (no pun here, not an entirely intended one at least) - and talking of drawn: I remember that the first movie had one style throughout the movie. This combines many styles (and universes/worlds) ... which suits the movie well. You have so many characters (some returning, but also quite a few new ones) .. and you have the old ones ""evolving"" to a degree. Still stuck - still trying to handle their situation, still struggling with having a ""normal"" life and being the superhero their city deserves (well let's assume that is the case).Cameos are here - and this is all over the place (ok that can be found guilty of being a pun) - we get references of so many things. Me not being as familiar as other when it comes to Spiderman comics ... I assume there are even more in jokes here that I was not able to comprehend or even detect. Twists are here to stay and the trailer did not really give away too much - so no finger pointing (I had to - as did the movie).Dialog is great - and quite fast paced! It does not leave you with room to breathe ... but it is tight and it works. And it also is helping that the voice cast is as good as one can imagine. The multiverse is here to stay - or you know switch around, fighting the good fight ... what I did not know: the movie is only part of a larger story ... so do not be surprised if the movie leaves you wanting more at the end ... to quote the movie: to be continued (thankfully the sequel is coming next year)","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","TheDanishMovie-Nerd","12 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' achieves something extraordinary, not only in the realm of animated superhero cinema, but in the broader landscape of film. It transcends boundaries, merging art, narrative, and emotional depth into an awe-inspiring spectacle that stuns in every frame.This movie doesn't merely satisfy, it surpasses expectations and redefines the creative frontier. Sequels rarely surpass the original; examples are few and far between, such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Empire Strikes Back.' However, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' takes its place in this esteemed echelon, a testament to the filmmakers' astonishing creativity.Each scene is a visual marvel; a testament to the tireless dedication of the artists involved. The filmmakers have weaved a vibrant tapestry of eye-catching colors, groundbreaking animation techniques, and arresting visuals that is nothing short of revolutionary. The audacity of its visual language is only paralleled by its storytelling ambitions, placing it alongside the great cinematic masterpieces of our time.The depth and nuance of the characters are another highlight. The voice actors have breathed life into these characters, delivering performances that are both genuine and touching. The film portrays Spider-Man (Miles Morales) with all the complexities and struggles of adolescence, amidst his inter-dimensional escapades. The depiction of his relationships - with family, friends, and even himself - are as authentic as they are affecting.The narrative arc of Miles Morales strikes a chord because of its universal appeal. It is a tale of growing up, finding one's path, and navigating life's trials, albeit through the lens of a multiverse-traveling teenage superhero. Even amidst the extraordinary, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' maintains a grounding in the utterly relatable, a feat that few films accomplish.In a perfect balancing act, the film manages to evoke laughter, tears, and cheers in equal measures. The humor is sharp and clever, the emotional moments are heart-wrenching, and the action sequences are thrillingly heroic.'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is more than a movie - it's an experience that resonates on many levels, and one that raises the bar for future films. It isn't just a great animation or a remarkable superhero movie, it is a cinematic masterpiece that will be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time. This is not just the perfect Spider-Man movie, but a perfect movie. Truly, a testament to the transformative power of cinema and a love letter to fans and newcomers alike.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","somekidzenvy","6 June 2023","I loved this movie. It was so well written and have just about everyone shining. It takes a complicated concept like the multiverse and actually tells it in a way anyone can understand and actually explore different types of universes.Gwen is shown struggling, vulnerable, yet still strong and confident. Miles isn't a side show in his own movie either even though we finally see Miguel take stage. They set this up for a sequel and I was honestly ready for another 2 hours when this ended.Just like the first movie, the soundtrack goes with the scenes and add to the feel. I grew up in NYC, and this really took me back. BRAVO!!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","nathanielkalatsky","8 June 2023","This movie is not what I expected. Like Morbius the trailers were very misleading, but in the best way possible. Morbius' trailer thankfully hid the parts about him morbing so it could be a surprise. Every event in this trailer happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie. After that the chai comes. Spiderman india is the hero of this movie. He introduces the chai tea or should I say tea tea, and he is the one who saves the day. There are so many jokes about Chai and it is very dramatic when miles drowns in Chai. Some of the jokes can be very rude to chai lovers. Its all in good fun though. Luckily one spiderverse bought spiderman india's chai and they all said chai tea at the same time. It annoyed the Chai monster villain who knew they were saying tea tea. While he was distracted spidermanindia drank him. Like how lego dimensions is the best lego game spiderman spiderverse is the best movie. I cant wait for morb. I also had got some chai tea while i was watching the movie. I love chai tea. I was very insulted at some parts despite the positives, but luckily I had chai to keep me entertained. I love chai. The actual story was definitly lacking however. I also think a lot of the themes could have been handled better. Miles should have probably gotten more focus which I wasn't thinking about before because I love chai. I actually would not recommend this movie. You should only see this movie if you love chai and you are drinking it while watching the movie. Actually don't watch the movie at all because it will insult any chai lovers out there. Overall following a great first movie, unfortunatly the sequel was very bad. Writing review is my passion.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","masonsaul","3 June 2023","From its very first opening moments, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an undeniable work of art. A bigger, bolder sequel that's not afraid to take its time with its character's growth and truly understands the character. Exploring in extremely meta, reality bending fashion the true burden of being Spider-Man.Shameik Moore is once again perfect, he's able to portray how Miles has grown since the first film effortlessly and remains loveable. Hailee Steinfeld is even better than last time with the best arc of the film, its just as much her film as it is Miles. Jason Schwartzman is great as the Spot, able go from being a joke to a genuine threat in really convincing fashion.Out of the new Spider-people, Oscar Isaac brings a palpable anger to Miguel O'Hara that conveys the burden he has and the lengths he'll go to and Daniel Kaluuya is the best new addition as Hobie, an unashamedly British character with the strongest moral compass and never betrays it, making him an easy favourite.In the years since the original came out, a fair few films have clearly been inspired by its animation and put their own spin on it but directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Justin K. Thompson and Kemp Powers do an excellent job of reminding you nothing can compete with Spider-verse. Its the literal definition of every frame a painting and every new dimension is so vibrant and unique.The soundtrack and score by Daniel Pemberton remain highlights, maintaining a strong balance between the two but Pemberton has really outdone himself with this score. It brings back all the themes that were so unique and memorable whilst adding new ones that are equally strong, if not better.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Silver5963","22 December 2023","I don't think I've been this bored in cinema for a while. This felt longer and more dragged out than three hours of Oppenheimer. I mean, Zack Snyder's Justice League felt less dragged out than this.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is easily the most overrated film of 2023 I've seen (I didn't see Barbie but part of me wishes I'd seen that instead).Rave all you want about the visuals but staring at those visuals for 2.5 hours on a large cinema screen soon becomes an eyesore.I have a minor personal gripe with Spider-Punk. Mostly because where I'm from in England, everybody tries to emulate the language and mannerisms of Hobie because they ""think it's cool"". It's not.The lack of Spider-Noir and Spider-Ham was felt too and that kinda knocks it down a bit.Spider-Man 2099 was incredibly predictable as a character. I don't get the hype there at all. So he's an edgy, unfunny Spider-Man, so what? He felt relatively flat in terms of character.Props where it's due, they did a great job turning The Spot into a genuine threat and not just a villain of the week. They should've focussed more on his part of the story instead of the Spider-Council side. Additionally, Indian Spider-Man was probably the best new addition in this film, as he seemed genuinely likeable and had a fun and unique vibe.The final act of this film dragged on for what felt like an hour in itself, throwing one plot twist, followed by another, then a cliffhanger but wait, there's more! Two more cliffhangers later and it's finally over. Pacing issues were prominent.And my final point, which is more of a personal preference really, but Miles Morales just isn't as good as Peter Parker. He's nowhere near as compelling and certainly not as iconic. When you say ""Spider-Man"" the default name is Peter Parker for a reason. This isn't exactly the worst Spider-Man film but No Way Home did multiversal Spider-Men better and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1 and 2 sweep them all.It shocks me that at one point this film was #3 on IMDb's Top 250 films because in no reality should it be a canon event that this film ranks higher than The Dark Knight. I'm hoping in the future people will rewatch this film, realise it's not all that, and the undeserved 8.6/10 rating drops lower.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Jf12345","26 June 2023","As a fan of Spiderman, I really enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse because it has the best plot supported by amazing visual effects which make this movie a godsend, a masterpiece. While watching this movie, I don't even realise it is a 2 hours 16 mins movie.Good:
Firstly, extraordinary animation. It not just kept the animation style of Into the spider verse, but it also expanded what they did in the first film. They boldly adopted a variety of different visual effects of the scenes. It uses six different animation styles to portray and create new universes whereas Into the Spider-Verse only used one. I can truly say that its animation sublimates the plot of the storyline in this movie. It is worth waiting for 5 years to watch this movie!!!!! Every scene every second is extraordinary. And this movie is not skimping on providing high quality animation with charming animation styles, also putting massive easter eggs for the audiences to dig for them.Secondly, the casts perfectly adopted characters. Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld give their best performance to make their own characters more attractive and trigger my emotions to care about these characters. In my opinion, I am very obsessed with the character of Miguel O'Hara. Oscar Isaac brings an amazing performance to show Miguel O'Hara's helplessness, determination to stop Miles and insistence on doing what he thinks is right. I don't even think that he is the villain, he is just a person who doesn't want Miles to go through what he experienced before.Thirdly, the sensational plot. The movie smartly chooses to build up the background of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy instead of just putting action scenes in the first act. It is efficient step by step to build up the characteristics of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy to let the audiences know what they care for. The audiences will keep on immersing in this film while watching.Bad
If I must say the bad of this movie, I would say that the story is not completed in part 1. Some movies separated the story plot into 2 parts to let the characters gather their strength for a final confrontation in the sequel such as ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Infinite War"". For these movies, they are great because the characters have completed something and the rest of the story will be resolved in the sequel. For example, the Rebel Alliance flees from the Empire in ""Empire Strikes Back"" and Thanos successfully cuts down half of the population in the universe after he snaps his finger in ""Infinity War"". However, ""Across the spider verse"" seems like the first and second act of the story. The movie doesn't not give any answer to resolve the story and the story questions still exist until the end of this film.In conclusion, I strongly recommend you watch this movie as much as you would. And you should watch the movie with the bigger screen. Remarkable animation, amazing story plot and sensational characters build the masterpiece and it deserves you to spend the time to watch it again and again.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","manasbhati","1 June 2023","They somehow managed to top almost every aspect of the first film. An extraordinary display of what animation is capable of. They're just showing off at this point...I guess the one thing that's worse than the first film is the plot. However, unlike the first one, Across the Spider-Verse exists to create a grand setup for the final film, and boy, it does that really well. Still can't beat the personal journey of Miles in the first movie though.Plus Daniel Pemberton's music is as good as ever. Each one of his themes used in the first film are thrown into overdrive here, and the brand new themes he introduces aren't too shabby.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","vinniec-53536","6 June 2023","In 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse', the follow-up to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse', we catch up with Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he tries his best to juggle his responsibilities as a student and son alongside his role as Brooklyn's one-and-only Spider-Man. However, when a new villain called The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) emerges and fellow spider-powered hero Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) unexpectedly returns, our friendly neighborhood wall-crawler embarks on an adventure that takes him way out of his neighborhood. In the same vein as such classic sequels as 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight', 'Across the Spider-Verse' tells a darker, more mature story than its predecessor, while still retaining much of the heart and humor that made it so beloved. While the film contains quite a few pretty heavy moments, there are also some wholesome, endearing ones as well, creating a nice balance. Revelations are revealed that give more depth to Miles and Gwen, and we see them make tough decisions that perfectly reflect who they are as characters. Some intriguing new players are introduced as well, such as the anti-establishment Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya) and the no-nonsense Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac), that add additional layers and perspectives to the story. The latter in particular creates a unique dilemma for Miles that no 15-year-old should have to face. The film also does a terrific job of taking a villain who starts out as an unintimidating joke and turns him into a terrifying threat by the end. While Miles himself is always a delight to watch, Gwen stole the show for me this time. She has a much bigger role than she did in 'Into the Spider-Verse' and takes her well-deserved place in the spotlight alongside Miles as essentially co-lead. With all that said, the film's biggest strength is absolutely its revolutionary visuals. 'Across the Spider-Verse' brilliantly blends multiple animation styles into a dazzling four-course feast for the eyeballs, so much so that as I went to sleep that night I was still trying to process everything I'd seen. From the beautiful environments to the mind-blowing action sequences to the characters themselves, every single shot in this movie is downright entrancing. In conclusion, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is unlike anything I've ever experienced. It's a true masterpiece of comic-book movies, of animation, and of filmmaking in general. The bar has been raised. Other studios, take notes: this is how it's done.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","pranayjalvi","4 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse looks incredible, even better than the groundbreaking first installment, but what's truly impressive about it is how willing it is to entrust its storytelling to its animation. There's not a frame of this rich, kaleidoscopically detailed animation that isn't dazzling.Across the Spider-Verse isn't just mind-bending spectacle - although it definitely dazzles in every frame. It's mind-bending spectacle in service of a thrilling story about a teenager facing the horrifying possibility that he can't fix everything. Undoubtedly this has gotta be the best of 2023 and we are gonna get the solution of the cliffhanger that Across the Spider-Verse has stranded us in.My Rating : 10/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","TheMysteriousReviewer","14 August 2023","I will be honest, it will be debatable to pick either this or Into The Spider-Verse that's the better. But either way, it truly blew me away. Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is not just among the best Spider-Man movie, but also one of the best animated superhero movie ever created next to The Incredibles. It has exceeded to the expectations people wanted with an exciting story that takes the Spider-Verse to a whole new level, top notch animation, unforgettable characters that has given more personalities to get us to know old and new, intense action, and one of the most shocking cliffhangers since The Empire Strikes Back. To fans of the first film, Spider-Man fans, superhero fans, and even fans of movies, this is the movie I think you are truly gonna enjoy. I really encourage to check it out. After watching this myself, this already got me excited for Beyond The Spider-Verse and hopefully it will give us a perfect ending to all this. I have no idea when that movie is going to come out. But when it does, let's go over this one more time.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jius","2 June 2023","Don't write many reviews, but this film deserves every bit of it's 10/10 score. The film pulls you in with the crispiest animation images I've seen on the big screen - you seriously cannot watch this on a home TV screen to give it justice. Beautiful colours and sequences it leaves you in awe. The score and soundtrack is amazing and is like the glue that binds the images together and feels very much part of the feel and story - not just some random celeb hits added as an afterthought.The excellent script with its qwerks, twists, jokes and heart felt moments just capture you attention non-stop, that you don't have time to even contemplate how time has passed in the real world. I've watch Disney and other animation stuff checking watch or phone waiting for the end, but not one bit in this movie. It truly captures your attention from beginning to end.The cast are very well put together with each voice and actor just giving fantastically to the story in their unique ways.I went to watch on a non-cheap night at the cinema with the whole family and it's the first film in a long long time that I didn't feel a bit robbed and actually came out so glad my little monetary contribution has gone into the film for cast and crew. They have done a fantastic job. It is by far the best Spiderman film in all areas.It seriously is a must watch!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","vithiet","20 August 2023","I absolutely love the first one and the fact I know so many people who are not into animated movies or comics who also found it great is a testament to its quality. So I went in this second chapter optimistically hoping they wouldn't mess up trying to emulate the first one; I certainly didn't think it would be equally good. And to my utmost surprise it's actually... better. It surpasses it in every way: the visuals of course but also the depth of the story and the writing that goes along, voice acting of course, terrific score, and just overall directing. 2.5 hours just went like that *snaps fingers* and since I didn't know it was planned to be a trilogy I let out a very loud ""Noooooo!"" when the words To Be Continued appeared as it felt like I was only 30 minutes in. If Beyond the Spider-verse ends up being as good (or dare I say it... better?) this will go down as one of the most perfect and impressive trilogies ever made. Oh yeah, highly recommended, in case that wasn't clear haha.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","tomasmug","2 June 2023","This movie is absolutely incredible. I strongly recommend watching it in a theatre - I don't believe you'll get the full experience on your home screen/laptop/etc. Might I recommend you see it in IMAX if you can.The Spiderverse animated saga is going to be remembered as one of the defining film series of this generation.This is the Empire Strikes Back, the Dark Knight of this generation.I know comparisons aren't particularly helpful to anyone, but I can't think of a better way to describe this film. It is absolutely fantastic in every way a I would say even more so than its predecessor, which was already a 10/10 film. Visually dazzling, hilarious, tense, dramatic - Across the Spider-verse has it all.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","krzysiektom","16 June 2023","I'm on the fence about it. Split into two scores. One is very, very high: the music score and soundtrack. Amazing! 10 out of 10 for me. The other score is weak: the movie itself. I find the story , direction, animation and the voices very mediocre. For children mostly. The script is very predictable, yet confusing at the same time. The amazing music score kept my attention till the end, were it not for the music I suspect I'd be bored. I'm not a fan of comics in general and I'm not a child. Only 2 out of 10 for me. So, I add the score of 10 and the score of 2, and divide it in half. I give the movie 6 stars.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","amrikaditya","3 June 2023","The movie has left no place for the audience to not like about, everything about the movie is just PERFECT at its core. The details, the animation, the Easter eggs, the story line, the humor, the action, the suspense, EVERYTHING!However the disappointing thing could only be how the movie ended as a part. But that's absolutely alright, I wouldn't have liked if a movie of over 4 hours end quickly (since that thing happens in theatres all the time). I wish I could watch this movie for the first time again and again, because it's that amazing.Conclusion : If you haven't already watched this, just go to the nearest freaking hall and watch it already!! You're missing out a movie of a lifetime. Hope you love it just like everyone else.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","hexx-52214","2 June 2023","I knew this movie was gonna be great. But i never thought it was gonna be this spectacular...!!!. Hands down the best movie ive ever watched in theatre. And maybe the best marvel movie too. Coming from a die hard DC fan ive enjoyed every single second of this movie. Visually its just marvellous. The animation style is unique. Even better than the first one. Story, tone, phasing , comedy and emotional weight is perfectly balanced. Last but not least the MUSIC. The music gave me literal chills all the way through. Ive never heard that much great music in any other comic based movie. Just perfect . Next thing is all the homage to old spidey movies, cartoons and comic books. Just well done. I hope one day ill be lucky enough to see a DC animated movie as good as this. Cant wait to see the next part.","10/10"

All of them.The story and the production overview:A very good film. Better than the first mostly due to the Spider Society. It wasn't a Spiderman battles Villians story then the end.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","gbanoon","1 June 2023","Without spoiling anything I just want to give a brief summary about this movie and how it is mindblowingly good.Just as I thought the last movie was already awesome, I thought this one would be as good or less. But it surpassed my expectations in an excellent way. This is the magnum opus of all animation in my opinion. It just combines so many different styles in one coherent movie, with an excellent story, cast and performances. I really was disappointed by the huge cliffhanger in the end, in a good way. Definitely going to rewatch this movie very soon, there are so many layers to this movie. In my opinion you can't fully appreciate what's on screen with just one watch, you need to see it multiple times to really let it sink in. This is definitely a highlight of the movies I watched this year so far.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","BenW1999","1 June 2023","A good film, but very overhyped.A loud gasp of disappointment went across the entire 400+ seated cinema. Many people saying it was ""sh!t"" and ""nothing happened"" and ""that was the deadest film""... and I partially agree.While an overall enjoyable film from my perspective, giving it an 8/10, critics have misled audiences AGAIN and set us up for disappointment. Not much...actually happens.We have a very VERY tedius 30ish minute intro and recap to all the characters we already know about, telling us everything we already know about Gwen and Miles, dragging out the runtime. There's no proper villain in the film either, we get a splatter of a few villains throughout, and one will obviously be a bigger villain in the third film, but... yeah...I sort of agree with the people complaining.I did find this more enjoyable than Guardians of the galaxy Vol 3, but its not the masterpiece 10/10 the paid critics give it.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","grantlauzon","2 June 2023","Best TV show this year. The writings great the visuals are stunning and at 2hours 20minutes I wish I could continue bingeing it. This is effectively Part 1 of the sequel to Into the Spider-Verse.The massive world(s) is(are) explained and explored at a beautiful pace that doesn't feel too beat you over the head expositiony.The first Spiderverse had a relatively small budget of 90million which it used to great effect. This movie looks like it has a 200million dollar budget. It's actually only 100million but with their experience from the first movie they've made great strides in squeezing beauty out of dollars especially when accounting for inflation.Across the Sider-Verse is the Tears of The Kingdom to Into the Spider-Verse's Breath of the Wild.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","raulvg-31151","4 June 2023","Miles Morales, the one and only Spider-Man...
of course not!The movie has PERFECT animation, with the best and most varied traits, in an incredibly fluid and full of life way.References and easter-eggs for Spidey fans are everywhere!That is, the film is also perfect in fan service ...In its plot, we learn a great question of what is right and wrong with arachnids.And even with little participation, Mayday Parker is TOO CUTE. (not a spoiler, the baby is in the trailer)Anyway, compliments to the voice acting and soundtrack, nothing I'm going to point out mistakes, I'd say that things about them can be improved... but the way they are, they're great!","1/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","clydekaila-04310","10 August 2023","""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" does an incredible, if not, amazing job of keeping the audience totally immersed in the story. With a perfect balance of telling and showing with its unmatched comic like animation, fresh and free flowing dialogue with undertones of humor and seriousness alike (achieving a perfect mix, adding to the story with cinematic aspects amplifying tone), outstanding street and abstract art and coloring along with beautiful cinematic lighting alike and masterful storytelling seamlessly completing the character arc of even the newer characters, hooking viewers deeper and deeper into the story unraveling every level (there's so many levels to this. Not to much. Just right. Oh soo good!) with every scene or sequence of scenes and act along with the totally insane and literally out-of-this-world action sequences and effortlessly engaging sound scape. A total must-see. A masterclass in storytelling and digital animation. Absolutely Brilliant in every way. Huge thanks to the Directors, Producers, Writers, Animators and Sound scape teams and Actors. Absolutely CANNOT wait for Beyond The Spider-Verse.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Vivekmaru45","11 August 2023","A simple Spider-Man cartoon. Can't you just make a simple Spider-man cartoon like the ones we saw during Stan Lee's early career. I'm talking about the 1967-1981. The 1981 Spider-Man cartoons were the best: a bridge between the old and new.Then we had the relatively good 1990 Spider-Man animated series. What I've just listed are the best along with the live action first three Spider-Man movies starring Nicholas Hammond: Spider-Man 1977, Spider-Man Strikes Back 1978 and Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge 1981. Tears fall from my eyes as I recollect watching Spider-Man 1977 shown to us by our teacher in playschool. I was a little nipper but the Spider-Man character stuck in my memory and later reinforced by the 1981 cartoons I used to see in the afternoon after school.How people forget Nicholas Hammond was the first and best actor to play Spider-Man. Like John Wesley Shipp who played The Flash in the 1990 series. Truth is that the film industry wants you to forget these people ever existed. It is quite a shame that John Wesley Shipp who looks strikingly like Bruce Campbell never rose to fame. Indeed I would have like these two to star alongside each other in a Sam Raimi directed movie.Plot of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman across the multiverse where he meets a team of Spider-People known as the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O'Hara/ Spider-Man 2099, but comes into conflict with them over handling a new threat in the form of the Spot.Verdict: just watched about 30 minutes and couldn't handle any more of it. Ironically I thought the previous installment made in 2018 was a much coherent plot and worth watching. Also I'm a staunch supporter of the original 1967 Peter Parker character created by Stan Lee who was a newspaper photographer. So why change???","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Mangalassery_Neelakandan","5 June 2023","One of the best if not the best spiderman movies out there. Mahn what a journey it was, the story, the score, the action sequences, the pace everything was top notch. For me this move is right there with no way home & spiderman 2. It had all the references in the world and that was really a fan treat. From the pointing meme, to the iconic scenes it was a total package.The animation style like in the first movie was the main highlight, the comic book like animation along with the fast changing frames was great, but some portions need to be paused to read what all are written there as it was there only for like a frame or two, but still, the effort they took just to animate a single frame and put that much detail on it is just epic.This dealt with multiverse more than the multiverse of madness, it showed every spiderman that can be shown in a 140 min film, the main leads, Miles, Gwen, Peter, Miguel, spider-women, spider man india, everyone had their own space in the film.If i kept on going there will be lot of spoilers so, keeping it simple, this is a must watch film for all spidey fans, the cliffhanger ending made this movie even special for me as i kept on wondering that they would rush a climax just for the sake of it, also there is no mid, or end credit scene, waited in the theater for atleast 5 minutes but there was nothing at all.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","anibalcnso","5 June 2023","My expectations were high with this film due to several reasons, especially taking into account how good the first one was. And still, it exceeded all of them. I cannot explain anything that hasn't been already told by everyone, critics and fans alike: the animation, the story-line, the soundtrack, the action scenes... everything is perfect and calculated even to the last detail. So polished, so carefully prepared. When the end of the film hit, I was ready to watch one more hour of the story, so it leaves you wanting, asking for more. In a 2 hour movie that is a tremendous achievement.I enjoyed it like a child and I could watch it several times more until the final part releases, which has a very difficult bar to reach, by the way.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","kjproulx","4 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse surprised the hell out of me back in 2018. Not only was I shocked at how entertaining it was, but also how well-crafted the story was. So, of course, I was eagerly awaiting the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Well, it's now playing in theatres and I'm honestly still trying to process it all. I'm not sure if words will be able to truly explain how much I loved this movie, but let's give it a go.After the events of the previous instalment left the multiverse wide open for exploring, we pick up right where we leave off, sort of. The film opens with a bit of Gwen's backstory and then dives into the family dynamic of Miles Morales' story once again, which will always be a highlight of these movies for me. Visited by Gwen, Miles decides to enter the multiverse again, but this time the stakes are far higher and certain revelations send this story in a whole new direction. I couldn't believe my eyes and what was visually being told, especially in certain moments. As a Spider-Man fan, I was grinning like a kid from ear to ear. It also gets much darker by the end which really surprised me for a film aimed at a younger audience.Even more than the first film, the animation here tells the story just as much as the dialogue. Each world had its own unique visual style and it seamlessly blended together after my eyes adjusted. At first I found all the animation styles jarring, but then I ended up thinking it was masterfully done. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen and it's seriously a work of art to look at and experience. I'm absolutely blown away by the look of this film.On top of the incredible animation, this story is just far deeper and richer than the first and is more mature as well. This is a film made for adults, with a child-like look to it. The scenes that both pay homage to the past while moving this story forward were inspired and I can't wait to see where they help the story further even more. This was a true theatrical experience I won't forget for a while. Yes, the animation is amazing and the story is incredibly well thought out, but if it wasn't for the screenplay this film wouldn't have also had the emotional impact.Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and Dave Callaham are a team that know exactly what they're doing here. I have full faith that the third film that closes out this trilogy will be just as good, simply because this film is very close to perfection for the story it was telling and I loved the first film too. Other than needing to adjust to the style a bit more than the first, I had zero complaints here and I haven't been able to say that about a movie in a while. If you can go along with the crazy visual style, I seriously can't recommend it enough. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is now playing in theatres and I think I have a new favourite Spider-Man movie, as a well as it currently being my favourite movie so far in 2023. It's truly spectacular in every conceivable way, especially for the type of film it is.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","spiderandwolf","3 June 2023","I want to go back and rewatch this movie again and again. It was so good that it has to be my favorite movie of all time now. The visuals and art are beautiful just like the first movie but this one has so many more plot twists and intense scenes mixed with comedy and it's just the perfect movie. I love how smart he is and his point in the movie, his wants and who he's trying to save it's perfect, I want a year to go by right now so I can watch the second part of the movie. Man this movie is a must watch even if u didn't watch the first movie although things are less confusing and more of wow factors if uve watched the first movie!","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","art96321","2 June 2023","Wow, what an incredible film. Coming in with high expectations after how great the first film was. The different animations styles of the different types of spider mans as they interact with one another. At times it can seem trippy but it keeps you engage to always keep looking at the spider-man.While the first act is your normal coming of age tale of having to balance being Spider-man and a teenager. Things start becoming fast paced and intense with the story when it gets to the 2nd act of the film.The intensity of the film kept me engage with the action and comedy. Also the storyline is just perfectly written for a multi-verse film for spider-man.With all the references to other media of spider-man, this is the ultimate film for spider-man lovers in all type of media. This film is more than a superhero film but a legitimate movie of the year contender. Top 5 superhero movies for sure.So fun and engaging that you will want more as the film ends.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Flak36","4 June 2023","I see tons of 10s and 9s so it must be a good movie except I had no idea what is going on.The visual style was beautiful and so was the animation. Those were the only aspects I enjoyed and even so, the movie is so overstretched and boring that I fell asleep halfway through for a few minutes.By the way, if I want to read a comic I don't have to go to the movies. Especially the filter to make the entire picture look like comic book paper was unnecessary.I don't know what else to say. I guess I'm in the minority of viewers who didn't like it. But I'll definitely won't be watching another one. I guess if I knew what's going on I would have liked it?","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","msxwilliams","3 June 2023","Fantastic!!! So glad I got to the theatre for this one, a true aesthetically thrilling experience.I loved into the spider verse, but I might have to vote that this one is even better! The plot comes into its own and we have a real sense of the characters in this one.***Spoiler***It ends with a ""to be continued"", so when you notice that you've been in the theatre for 2.5 hours and the plot is nowhere near resolved, you are a bit disappointed for a second.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Karamakate","5 June 2023","Into the Spider-Verse showed us just a crumb of visual possibilities; Across the Spider-Verse doesn't hold back and brings us the most stunning visuals we've ever seen in animation. The details in the animation is mindblowing, like Miles' new suit that feels vibrant with the colors and texture.This is brave storytelling, this is art, this is the pure meaning with film and this is a breathtaking absolute masterpiece.The runtime is deserved and enjoyable thru out, it dares to set it own terms with giving us the plot and hang with the characters. There are brilliant tie-ins to the established multiverse, the character gallery is even better than Into the Spider-Verse and you can really feel the high stakes. Truly unpredictable and I wasn't prepared at all for the ending.Go watch it on IMAX-screen!","10/10"

I was ready to set for 4 hours if it was necessary that is how great it was. This movie could lead to the best triology ever made for a superhero, comic, animated movie ever. It was mind-blowing. The spot they took a not knowen villian to make it maybe the greatest super-villian in a comic book movie. Miguel was in a beast mood all through the movie.

You can't see it when it comes out on streaming or DVD. See it in theaters it is worth the money. This is better than Spider-Man No Way Home too. This is the best Spider-Man movie ever.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","heyrandom","1 June 2023","I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it's predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it's predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024. I think Across the spiderverse has a real shot at the Oscar for best animated pictures, which Into the Spiderverse won in 2019.","3/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","dmoorejr","4 June 2023","At long last we have our sequel to Into The Spiderverse. One thing I'll point out is the astonishing animation/visual effects. Truly a work of art. The way each Spiderperson had their own unique style continues to be a highlight of this franchise. It was really cool to see all the different variations of Spider-Man all in one movie. With that being said the script was a little misguided, and really failed to tell a solid story in one movie. The focus of this movie is fractured, and we as an audience are along for the ride. Definitely feels like an extended 2nd act. I've aways said a movie should be more than sequel bait, and I feel the writers stretched this story to get one more movie out of it. While it'll be an epic binge in the future, I don't see myself rewatching this one until the Spiderverse trilogy is complete.","7/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","sbentley-90703","26 June 2023","Saw the 9.0 here and was super excited to see this film. Very disappointing! Plot moves at light speed, and continues to jump around the whole film. Scenes flash every 2 seconds and it was exhausting to follow. Animation is excellent, but this movie lacked the hook that made the first one so good. Maybe this is where movies are now headed, but I hope not. For a show aimed toward a younger audience, the film was way too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes and seemed to hold the audience hostage. Very hard to keep track of all the characters and plot shifts. Was hoping for something better but it seemed like a comic book on speed.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jack_o_hasanov_imdb","2 June 2023","It was fun to watch in the cinema. But this is for sure. Not as good as the first movie. In some scenes I was so bored, I even fell asleep. I don't think the effects are as good as the first movie. But still not bad of course. I had fun. Spidermen were great. It was so good to see different spidermen. The action wasn't bad either. The ""meme scene"" was so funny. But there was something that wasn't there. Also, the fact that they ended the movie halfway like a series lowered my respect for the movie. It was like a filler movie then. It could be better. Unfortunately, I don't know how the original voiceovers are not yet, since I watched it with dubbing. But I'm sure it's very good. Once again, I'll probably watch it in English. Anyway, I think it was a good animated movie, but not as good as the first movie.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","marwinsingh-30063","4 June 2023","Spider man across the spider verse is one the best movies based on comic books i've ever seen.. It had everything I've ever dreamed of as a Spider Man fan... From groundbreaking visuals to unique animation to colorfull different universes to awesome soundtrack with decent action scenes and a great story it has everything you need from a comic book movie.. It looks like an comic book comes to life.. Set after 1yr of previous film this film explores Miles Morales's character of Spider Man and also expand on the character of Gwen Stacy/ Spider Woman.. I always wanted to see Spider Man 2099 and my wish got true with this film.. The scene where entire Spider society chase Miles Morales is highlight of this movie and will become iconic in future.. Seeing hundreds of different versions of Spider Man such as Scarlet Spider, Spider Punk, Spider Man Unlimited, Spider Man India, Ps4 Spider Man, Spider Man 2000, Spectacular Spider Man, Lego Spider Man etc in a single scene was feast to the eyes and satisfaction to the soul.. Story wise it was also amazing filled with many dramatic elements to scenes of full thrill and suspense with some comedy was amazing to experience.. Color palette of this movie is unique each universe has a different vibe to it.. Even though I don't watch many animated movies I can proudly say my love for Spider Man leads me to a theatre and gave me an once in a lifetime opportunity to experience this on a big screen.. Can't wait for next installment and very excited to see how this universe will grow from here.. Every comic book lover should see this film in theater and die hard fans of Spider man can't miss this one.. It gave me same experience I got with Spider Man No Way Home....

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ybredad","1 November 2023","A quick review on this.Not at good as the first, but had some cool characters showing up like the British bloke, and megalomaniac Miguel.My eight year old niece was so taken by this installment, however, that I was so glad it showed up on my view list on Netflix queue slightly after our conversation this weekend. I still listen to the soundtrack from the first movie. It's all over my run mix. Guess I was hoping for a similar find of music this time round. Seems as though they tried sticking with the same folks {I suppose there is some Uber cinephile who can address that for sure}.Point is, the movie is good, but I think the first was great. Good is still a feat, since many sequels flat out fail. Good on 'em.Gonna go listen to the whole soundtrack a few more times.Solid all around.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","rshariff-66038","31 May 2023","There are rarely movies that are better then the prequel - this movie is one of them. The amount of detail in the movie and the angles are ridiculously good. I really loved how gwen and miles' stories were expanded upon, and how many new characters were introduced - especially the scientist that got hit with a bagel in the previous movie. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to view the screening of the movie, and that was the highlight of my day, keeping me on the seat waiting for the next big event. The only part I disliked was probably the ginormous cliff hanger at the end - since now I have to wait till next march to view the final movie.I CANNOT wait until the third one is released, and the day it gets released - will be going to the theater to watch it.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Mr-Fusion","4 June 2023","God, what a rush this movie is!I said it back in 2018, Sony really has something special here, and ""Across the Spiderverse"" is an enhancement in nearly every way. And it's a rush, an absolute blast for anyone looking for a summer escape.I love that the writers spend so much time on Miles and Gwen, their relationship, their struggles with expectation, and to see them go for a swing through NYC is just ... I love that vibe, man. In such a headlong flight of a story, it's refreshing to see Miles' social and family lives fleshed out.But it is a full-tilt movie, and once it starts dealing with the actual Spiderverse, it's chaotic, breathless and a welcome sensory barrage of color and eye-popping animation. It is a theme park ride, and one I'd absolutely do again.This continues to be the most unique, character-authentic series of Spider-Man movies and I am unquestionably a fan.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","curmudgeon86","2 October 2023","Into the Spider-Verse was one of the rare big studio movies that felt fresh, authentic and full of heart. Across the Spider-Verse falls short of matching its predecessor in each of those counts.Whenever a superhero movie succeeds, big studios try to distill its essence down to a formula, trim out any creative risks to make it safe for large-scale public consumption and add some fanservice. This is the case with the second instalment of Spider-verse.Except for the art. The art was brilliant and original. But little else stays with you after after the end.On a side note, is anyone else tired of multiverses? In the first movie, spider-beings from different dimensions were fresh and funny. Twenty popular movies and series later, it feels played out. The central plot feels like something out of an old Rick and Morty episode.But the bigger problem was this: the essence of Spider Man stories is that he is both a teenager and a superhero. He has typical teenager problems, struggles to juggle his double life, makes mistakes and learns from them. The first half of the movie followed that template and was good fun to watch.But then the movie turns it upside down and the teens become smarter than the adults. The adult Spider folks in Spider HQ(which was basically Citadel of Ricks from R&M) not only approach a sensitive conversation with Miles with the delicacy of a sledgehammer, it's unclear if they even know what they are talking about.The centrepiece of the movie is an extended chase scene with little suspense about the result. Here's another thing that annoys me: making your hero suddenly overpowered by having them beat other characters in a way that defies in-universe logic.The English punk spiderman made me chuckle though.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","digitalbablukumar","1 October 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" swings into action with a dazzling display of animation and a heartwarming multiverse story. It's a spectacular sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it. The visuals are mind-bending, showcasing the potential of animation in storytelling. The characters remain endearing, and the introduction of new Spider-People adds depth to the narrative. The humor is sharp, and the action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking. The film strikes a perfect balance between lighthearted moments and emotional depth. It's a cinematic achievement that leaves you eagerly anticipating the next installment in this spectacular Spider-Verse saga.","3/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ryanhadi","23 September 2023","I rarely say this about cliffhangers but this one hit a spot, a good one.If you loved the first one, you will surely love this one more because...it is more, it has more, and it definitely will entertain you more. You will surely love the grown up Miles and his loved ones.Everything about this sequel was so on point with what a Spider-verse should be like, not a single chance to make a prediction. Very smart storytelling with edgy action and vibrant imagination.Sure, it's another version of Spider Man exploring the multiverse, but it's what has been set up as the base of all Marvel movies and characters therein.Can't wait for the next one!","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","kylebelcher","8 June 2023","Either this movie is getting it's score bumped up by bot accounts, or I watched a ""mid"" version from another dimension.I'm honestly baffled by all reviews that I've seen for this movie. It's far from a masterpiece, but the critics who are speaking out against the film are seemingly doing so for clicks. Filling their ""review"" with zingers and half backed complaints about the movies undoubtedly fantastic art direction and animation.This movie falls flat when it comes to pacing and plot. The first half of the movie had me engaged, despite drawn out character moments (which are arguably needed, I'd just argue they could flow better and cut down on runtime) and the fact that we don't see Miles get pulled into the main plotline until a round half way through the film had me loosing some interest admittedly. This was something reviewers took into account for other films, like the first of The Hobbit trilogy, so why does this film get a pass?I was definitely ready to check out when we got to the scene on the bridge in Mumbai and Gwen was the only one to get an alert about a breach in the ""cannon"". How we can we blame Miles or Gwen for doing a sloppy job when the writing is sloppier? Why didn't anyone else present on the bridge get an alert? Why didn't Pavitr know about this cannon event like everyone else? When it's heavily insinuated that all of the Spider-Men/woman working for Miguel know about all of this stuff and are actively working to avoid a multiversal doomsday event.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","saikatsamanta","22 August 2023","After the wildly creative and emotionally profound ""Into the Spiderverse"" Blew us all Away, the sequel takes us across the spiderverse with keeping the core strengths of the first movie intact, and setting up a spectacular final film that will make this the Greatest Spiderman trilogy. Once again the revolutionizing art style steals the spotlight, with each character getting its own unique color palette and motion art, with visual angles to die for and creating some of the most jaw-dropping action scenes. Once again incredible voice-acting and writing, focusing on the core family bonds and how each spiderman's destiny and story correlate. The Villain ""Spot"" also is given his own unique journey. I dont like Cliffhanger endings in films so that was a negative for me. But what truly matters is that Its a Love Letter to all Spiderman Fans... Go and watch it.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","sventempest","27 June 2023","This is the difference between a super hero movie having something to sell and having something to actually say.I haven't been excited about a super hero movie since having watched endgame part one and never bothering to show up for endgame part two. Eventually, the MCU stopped having stakes. It stopped havj G characters. It just became a succession of adverts for the next movie in the sequence of exhausting cookie cutter same old same old adverts for the next movie.What is obviously now going to be the spider verse trilogy, has for lack of a better word, soul.If you want to go in assuming it's empty spectacle, it can deliver in spades, entertaining and colourful, gorgeous at every second. If you want a story of found family, acceptance, love, stuggling to be your best self, it's there. But if you scratch just a little deeper, you find a scathing metatextual commentary on the destructive rigidity of canon. You find a biting social commentary on the dynamics of power, institutionalised bigotry and othering.You find, an actual damn story.Not just Generic Hero Man or Woman saves the CGI world from Generic Baddie Man or Woman, end credits sting for next film. Not just bland nothings serving up the next bland nothing ad infinitum.An actual story. A modern day fable designed to ask questions, designed to mean something beneath all the superheroic trappings. A fun romp that actually bothers to try and mean something in a genre bereft of any meaning.This is what a comic book, super hero movie, should be. Accept nothing less.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","benjaminskylerhill","1 June 2023","Today, I saw some of the most inventive, bold, and charming sequences I have ever witnessed on a big screen.Across the Spider-Verse sets up a huge amount of characters and plot devices, and it almost always does so with an astounding amount of grace, power, and wit.The internal conflicts given to Miles and Gwen are compelling, relatable, and emotionally wrenching. The first ten minutes of this movie alone made me feel more than most entire films I've seen all year.This takes the zany, colorful, creative action of the previous film and ups everything; the spectacle is thrilling and fast when it needs to be, but these filmmakers weren't afraid to pull back for small intimate character moments either.Admittedly, the movie does suffer from its need to set everything up for a big finale, as the story's two villains don't get nearly enough time or development to make the threat seem as big as it is. And the cliffhanger ending is, by its nature, unable to provide satisfying payoff for the things it sets up.So here I am, feeling like I just watched the first half of a masterful film, and though I'm not satisfied yet, I anxiously await part two. Because I was all in.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","chand-suhas","1 June 2023","The sequel to the 2018 gem packs enough to match the hype created. This time Miles' Spider-Man gets his own nemesis, going by the name The Spot. The teenager tries hard to get his parents to ground him while triggering the nemesis with his humor. He misses Gwen who has joined the Spider Society and like any teenager, he wants Gwen and wants to be part of the society. How much of a serious threat The Spot gets to be and what does it cost to Miles' to save the spider-verse forms rest of the story.First, the visuals stand out again and the archival footages too got more cheers. They indeed set up the story well for Beyond the Spider-Verse. However, the plot felt overstuffed and since the final act was meant for setting up the story for the sequel, it simply drags on predictably. The stereotypical Mumbattan episode aside, the action and humor kept things engaging. Since the first movie went bonkers in it's final act, the sequel fell way short compared to that.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","CinemaClown","16 June 2023","Bigger, better & breathtaking in ways most sequels never manage to, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an ambitious & audacious follow-up that takes what was refreshing & original about its predecessor and builds upon it in ways that catapults its world to better heights and delivers the expected greatness without sacrificing any of the emotional beats that ground its story & characters.Directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers & Justin K. Thompson in their feature directorial debuts, the film utilises different animations for the different dimensions our characters traverse through while keeping the narrative arresting & accessible from start to finish. And all the time it takes to setup its premise during the first half is the reason why it's able to provide an onslaught of awesomeness in the next half.Everything is an upgrade here, be it the story, characters, animation, visuals, music, wit, gags & underlying themes. And the energy, vibrance, passion, heart & sincerity poured into every frame is evident throughout. Characters, both new & reprising, are treated with care, handled with flair and embedded with personalities. And the twists & revelations surface in ways that only amplify its edge-of-the-seat thrills & our investment in it.The only nitpick for me would be its lack of a proper resolution as it ends on a cliffhanger and is one-half of a full story instead of featuring a self-contained narrative. Nevertheless, it's a minor complaint when taking into account the so many things that it gets right, for there are moments in this picture that had made me wondering if I'm watching the new greatest comic-book film of all time coz it's the perfect story of what it means to be a hero.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a bonafide masterpiece that outshines the first film in almost every aspect and is one of the greatest examples of its genre(s). A marvel of first-rate storytelling and a feat of groundbreaking animation that strikes a perfect balance between its visual & thematic elements, this latest offering in the Spider-Verse series is accomplished on all fronts and will leave its viewers absolutely dazzled yet hungry for more.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","shrikrishnasriram","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse not only builds upon the brilliance of its predecessor but takes the scope of it to a whole new level. The film plunges audiences into an exhilarating journey across dimensions, where familiar characters and new faces collide in a visually stunning and emotionally resonant narrative.One of the standout aspects of this film is its ability to strike a delicate balance between paying homage to the original while expanding its universe in unexpected ways. The first movie introduced us to the groundbreaking animation style, capturing our hearts with its heartfelt storytelling and dynamic characters. Across the Spider-Verse, however, elevates the stakes and explores uncharted territories, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in this genre of movies as a whole.The animation remains a work of art, with each frame bursting with energy, inventiveness, and meticulous attention to detail. From the kaleidoscopic visuals that bring the various universes to life, to the fluid and dynamic action sequences that leave us breathless, every moment is a testament to the creativity and talent of the filmmakers.Moreover, Across the Spider-Verse delves deeper into the characters we fell in love with in the first film, allowing them to evolve and face new challenges. The emotional depth and growth of the characters resonate with audiences on a profound level, making us cheer for their triumphs and empathize with their struggles. The film strikes a perfect balance between heartwarming moments, thrilling action, and thought-provoking themes, making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. However, audiences should go into this knowing that it's definitely a 'Part 1' of a larger narrative in every sense.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse cements its place not only as a worthy successor to its predecessor but as a groundbreaking and unforgettable film in its own right. It expands the Spider-Verse in ways we couldn't have imagined, immersing us in a world of boundless imagination and emotional resonance. With its breathtaking animation, complex characters, and masterful storytelling, it stands as a testament to the power and potential of animated films, leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment in this extraordinary franchise.Choosing between the two is like choosing between your kids - the first is a tighter story but this movie is far more expansive and blows the scope of the movie into the stratosphere taking risks along the way. They're equally perfect in different ways.","5/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ninjaninja-85128","22 July 2023","First off, I see a ton of reviews knocking this movie, giving it a low score mainly for the movie leaving in a cliffhanger... are you serious? Who knew it's a requirement to not leave a movie in a cliffhanger in order for it to be a good movie.I have seen Across the Spiderverse 4 times in theaters. Each time going into the theater I think the movie won't catch my eye like the last watch, and every time I'm wrong. The whole movie is complete eye candy. The animation is incredible, the colors, the art styles. Even from the opening credits... the amount of effort that went into the credits must've been ridiculous.The story has a really nice pace. While having suspenseful and emotional moments in there as well which really hit close to home. The plot was clever with The Spot. Turning from a joke to a serious threat. I loved the music that was used. A lot of the jokes hit. The characters introduced weren't overwhelming, and there were some returning characters which was a nice surprise.I mainly wanted to make this review to say if you rate this movie anything less than an 8 it's just a total insult to everyone who worked on this movie. The animation alone is way better than Into the Spiderverse. Absolutely stunning. There are also plenty of great movies out there that end on cliffhangers, Infinity War being one. This movie is among the greats, regardless of what you may think of the ending.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jyszxpxqfhrg","15 January 2024","There is too much going on in this film. It shows in both the runtime and pacing. They were trying to go too big too fast. It should've been multiple different movies. Gwen could've had her own film based on the introduction.You don't get enough time to relate with the characters or appreciate the story beats. They just keep whipping you from one major event to another. There are also several weird plot holes as a result. It just brain my mind numb by the end.This remind me of Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. The writers wanted to squeeze a whole cinematic universe's worth of content into one movie. Some people may love the ambition, but I just don't see the masterpiece everyone else is talking about.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","turleymjennifer","20 June 2023","I had such high hopes for this sequel, but the extreme artistic liberties with the constantly shifting backgrounds made it difficult to follow the dialog, the emotional scenes lost their impact for me when the characters were changing colour with every camera angle shift.I enjoyed the continued character development and additions of all the new spidermen, but I just could not get past the non stop swirling, flashing and dripping colours.The extreme use of the glitching and flashing graphics had me closing my eyes for periods of time just to get a break, as well it made the fight scenes and swinging scenes very difficult to follow.I understand the first movie had taken liberties with artistic aspects as well but I feel the second film was just over done with them.I still love the story line and where the film is going I just hope for my heads sake they tone it down a little in the next film.","10/10"

I'm not sure if it's the constant disappointment from the latest Marvel movie, but this movie was beyond incredible.Another solid storyline, fantastic VA and art work, great soundtrack, and cameos that made me very happy. The addition of Oscar Isaac and Daniel Kaluuya helps elevate the movie further, they've done such a good job. Seeing Miles' relationship with Gwen and Peter be developed further was also great, as they try to balance doing what's good for the multiverse and what's good for Miles.I can't wait to see the next instalment, this is shaping up to be one of the better trilogies in cinema.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","whatyalookinat","10 August 2023","From the opening scene I was sure the film's gonna be a masterpiece. An esthetically flawless picture with special animation style for each dimension. Especially Gwen's world, it was a definition of 'emotional', I still have goosebumps every time enjoying the scene. Also, the visuals were complemented by the soundtrack which made me wanna smile every time a song starts.Should I even mention all the references to not just the MCU, but other different things? I'm not sure if one can tell me the exact number of spiders that appeared. That's what Marvel does the best and it's the perfect film for such references.Overall, it was an unbelievable superhero picture with some interpersonal problems explored. I highly enjoyed the pacing of ATSV which wasn't boring at all. Looking forward to watching Beyond The Spiderverse. Not sure if it's gonna be EVEN better but my expectations are still high.","10/10"

Started this movie had a great dose of action and humour and romance. One of the reasons why this movie works is that it has a whole universe to explore. And the characters are easy to love. And in this movie they explore Miles and Gwen relationship with each other. And Peter has MJ and a child. And all the characters they can have. There's so much references to The whole spider verse.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","mkanatlar","3 June 2023","I rarely ever leave reviews on movies but I just had to say a couple of things about Across the Spider-Verse. The first movie was already so amazing that it inspired creativity in the animation industry but this installment just finessed its style. The different universes and styles, different animations; there were genuine moments where I felt chills just looking at the screen.I'm a story guy, I can appriciate good cinematography and visuals but the main thing that gets me going while watching movies is the story and let me tell you something: THIS IS SOME DAMN GOOD WRITING. The dialogue feels so alive and realistic, the small mimics and details make you feel like every scene was spent countless hours on to perfect. It all comes together beautifully. It works amazing as both a sequel and the set up of the third film, yet it is also a great standalone film as my friend who hasn't seen the first one also found it amazing.We can't forget the acting, as good as the animations and the hand drawings are amazing, the voice acting is as spectacular if not better than the first film. There has never been a moment which a character seemed dull or insensible. Props to all the voice actors, especially Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfield. I don't know the recording process of the voice lines but Miles and Gwen didn't have one moment where it didn't feel like I was watching a chemical reaction.The only thing that made me sad is that as the time frame got closer to the end, I expected the movie to end the way it did. I'm not mad because it ended the way it did but because I thought I'd have to wait 3 or 4 years for the sequel. Thank god it is announced to release next year so that's that.Whether you're an elder, adult, teen, or a child; this Spider-Verse story has something for you. Not only you'll enjoy the experience of watching a comic book; you'll also go through a fun, but heartfelt story. I think this is a movie everyone should see.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","mahmus","4 June 2023","Bigger and more ambitious than the first one in almost every way. Bigger stakes, more and fanservice and even more Spider-men, but never at the expense of the very personal and emotional story. The character development is incredible, with Gwen's story being the easy standout for me. The movie's fairly long and it doesn't waste a single minute. It could've been five hours long and I wouldn't have complained. It will obviously leave you wanting even more.The animation is mind-blowing. As gorgeous as you'd expect from a sequel to Into The Spider-verse.I don't know how they did it, but they did it. Again. What an incredible movie.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","utvolssam","24 June 2023","This is most definitely the movie of the year! The animation, the backgrounds for characters, the fight scenes. All just amazing. It made me really think about how much people in my life mean to me and how much I mean to them. I have absolutely no idea how they were able to top the last one but they did. I'm a bit worried that they won't be able to top the next one though, all doubts set aside, I still think that they have the abilities to pull it off. That's why I am truly excited for the next one. By the way it is coming out at the end of march next year if anyone wanted to know. Hey at least it's not another 5 years like the last one.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","asayed-63121","3 June 2023","This is how a movie featuring multiverse should be.The first thing that one notices in the movie is how they have amped up their animation game. If you think the the animation in the previous installment was great, wait till you set your eyes on this one. With gorgeous colour palettes, each frame can be a wallpaper on your personal dekstop.No Spoilers here, but if you are a spidey-buff you will have fun picking up on the easter eggs. It is plain to see that the makers have a ton of love for the source material. From references to cameos, you will find everything over here.The soundtrack was also amazing. The collection of songs perfectly captured the tone of the film.The plot of the movie is also something that needs to be appreciated. It makes you root for the character and the third half of the film has a twist that you wouldn't see coming. There was a collectible gasp from the audience in the cinema while I watching, as no one expected. Even though there are jokes, it doesn't distract us from the core narrative, which has been the problem with MCU moviesEven though the movie is 2 hours 20 minutes long, the movie passes away like a breeze, you won't find yourself bored or checking your phone. Which is perfect for a commercial superhero flick.","10/10"

I have no idea how much effort went into making the Paramount Pictures/Sony logo and editing it to get the glitch effect, let alone the entire film. *slow claps*
Music and Sound Design - AMAZING! The OST and the way it's been used throughout the film - I'd watch it again for this and the visuals alone.Writing - AWESOME! It's not easy write for a film, I can't begin to think how tough it would have been to write something to bring everybody in and make a Spider-society without making it feel choppy. And I am not even going to attempt to comment on the writing for the storyline.A cinematic experience like nothing else - don't miss this in big screens. You can always re-watch on digital/streaming.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","nqmedia","31 July 2023","This is my favorite animated film of the year and was better than I was expecting (as I'm over the whole multiverse storyline in films). It took a horrible comic villain and made it into a formidable foe; it took one of my favorite Spider-Mans (Spider-Man 2099) and made him into a formidable and flawed hero/villain, and it crafted and amazing story for both leads, while also ending the story in Part 1 while setting up another spin-off story for Part 2. I also loved the mix of animation styles as it made sense to the story (and wasn't just a gimmick) and the music score was perfect! One of the best films of '23 in my opinion.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","powellian6","4 June 2023","Wow I cannot believe how good this movie was. I expected it to be extremely good based of trailers and the enjoyment I had with Into The SpiderVerse (2018) but this takes everything to the next level.Sony Pictures Animation has made the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing animated film ever made. It's incredibly impressive to see the layers and layers of animation. The color is beautiful vibrant and bright constantly changing color schemes that fit the moods and characters of those that are in frame. It's an excellent way to add an layer of depth within this world that in real time would be extremely hard to capture. I honestly have no idea how you make a movie like this.The music is phenomenal as I expected. Channeling from lo fi chill music to high octane beats and chilling numbers across the board this has some of the best music in any animated film.The big catch for most people is that this is an incomplete film. While it does leave us on the edge of our seats asking for me the film itself is a complete story with certain characters. Sure the whole thing isn't quite settled but I don't expect the last one to miss at all especially since it will be out next year and it's already made.This is the best Spider-Man movie ever made and might even run into the next greatest spider man movie ever made establishing itself as possibly the greatest superhero trilogy of all time. Without a doubt see this movie.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","hucken","8 August 2023","I struggled giving it 10/10, but i can't think of a negative thing here.First of all the music is perfect. Especially the intro / Gwen Stacy part was perfect here. Her emotions amplified by the drums. Her vs. Peter and when she puts on the costume in her room going into the next fight and the whole fight theme. Everything was elevated by the music perfectly and hyped me up for the complete first part of the movie.And the art style ... it is just beautiful. It is brave to have such unique art style for a whole movie and it pays of. Every scene is a piece of art. If you have the video, you can pause like every frame and make a wallpaper out of it.The story was good too. When you thought it was predictable, it wasn't (e.g. Hey there is this machine that brings you back to your universe - that will absoluteley be used later - but didn't see the plot twist here)
Also some deep plote lines everywhere. The movie was long and i was never bored. Worst was the TBC. (but a plus for the movie itself, because you wanted to continue to watch)I wanted to make a minus point on the fast combat/swing scenes, but even there - it was fast, sometimes hard to follow but it still had a really nice flow to it that made it enjoyable. They were able to make every move of the Spider-whatever powerful and impactful.Half of the movie was a Spider Gwen movie and i wasn't even mad about it. The character is so good, that i hope they will make a Spider Gwen spin-off.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","parasvanzari","3 June 2023","Honest and totally honest. If people are giving 8-9 stars for just graphics and designing & VFX, back up people, there's alot more there should be for a 9 star.It starts good, it gives you hopes, the comedy is good, but then, it gets all sentimental and emotional. I know it's needed, but it just gets so much that it kind of gets sleepy.They carry the story too slow because of this emotional backstories, not actually focusing on the main writing, I don't really think the back stories were really required so much and even more so, not so much in DETAIL.After all things said and done, the movie heads to main plotline, how to get to stop the villain, a squad is formed for that, the main character is stuck and needs to find a way out, it all gets interesting, and then, A CLIFFHANGER. End.Wasted too much time in the unnecessary and making a part 3 out of that seems like a 'loosen your pocket for more in the next one'.People giving 8-9 stars, even 10, seriously! Grow up kiddos. This movie wasn't MARVEL at all. It was Disneyland for kids.","1/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Jeremy_Urquhart","22 June 2023","Even if I'd had a nice quiet crowd the first time I saw this (I really didn't), this still felt like the kind of movie that demanded a second viewing. Distractions aside, there's just a lot to take in the first time around. The basics are well explained, but the extra/additional details come fast and things that aren't specifically part of the core story can pass by so speedily I couldn't catch as much as I wanted to. A second viewing honestly felt like a first viewing for more than half this movie. I caught a couple more jokes, appreciated the unexpected turns in the narrative (that ending included), and just enjoyed the whole thing a great deal more.I still prefer the first Spider-Verse movie by a hair, because it has a little more emotional weight for me, and I think it's paced a touch better. But Across the Spider-Verse is still emotional and well-paced; I think it flies by so quickly that that ending feels shocking on a first viewing, because the film kind of feels like two acts (with an extended prologue and epilogue) rather than three. The structure's interesting and a little odd, but again, it worked better after seeing it once, and being able to piece it all together while seeing it play out again.And it probably goes without saying, but the animation here is just out of this world. That's the one area that is better than the first, and the first already looked amazing. The music's also just as good, possibly even better. I hope Beyond the Spider-Verse will conclude this trilogy amazingly, and it's probably no exaggeration to say it might be my most anticipated movie of 2024, at least for now (and I'm sure others feel the same way).","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","eoinageary","12 July 2023","I had tried to stay away from trailers to avoid as much as I can and wow, I am blown away.The story is good, it's a follow up to the previous where Miles is still struggling to balance the spider life and being a kid, he is missing his multiverse friends and especially Gwen. The movie really gets going when a new villain called spot who can travel through holes to anywhere is demolished by miles and insulted. He plans to grow his powers, creating the ability to multiverse travel. The story goes on and it's hard to say as it continues after spoilers but things MUST happen but Miles can't accept it.The animation was AMAZING,seeing miles and Gwen swing through NY was perfect, it goes along with a pitch perfect score, there was once or twice the voices were quite low behind the music but that could have been the cinema. I also love that there are 2 major different sides when it comes to Miles and Spider-Man 2099, and I can 100% see both sides !!!Obviously it's around Miles but this movie is equally Gwens movie, she has gone through and is going through a lot. The supporting characters were all great and this movie is genuinely funny.This is not a spoiler but the movie ends on a cliffhanger and the third movie is scheduled for next year. This doesn't take away from the movie, it leaves me wanting more in a good way, 9/10.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","phiup","14 August 2023","This movie was convoluted as a it could be.First 10 minutes are set up for gwen.Next 35 minutes are set up for Multiverse.Next 30 minutes are set up for Miles's actual story arch.We finally arrive at the rising action about 1 hr and 30 minutes into the movie. With climax being...dun dun dun...to be continued.This movie was awful.They over played the art style. Like really, each universe needs its own art style. Truth be told it detracted from the story. I had to revisit portions because I was taking out of the story by the obnoxious flickering and flowing colors. It worked in the last one cause you used one back ground. But when the background becomes a character...you have no story.And whats more, your main villain is a good guy who will switch to reluctantly following Miles in the next film...who knows, maybe even laying his life down cause Miles made him a believer.YAWN!!! I had to switch to different activities 4 times in this movie because that is how unwatchable this film is.The one compelling character, Spider-punk, was so authentic he is incomprehensible by american audiences. I watch tons of english set films, but they literally had spider-punk mumble his cockney. Absolutely the worst spiderman film ever.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","hassannaima-55714","2 July 2023","This here movie isn't one of those movies when animation is the only good part. This here movie has amazing story, and connects really well to the first movie overall. It seems like all this was planned ahead, and it probably was.I really liked the movie and its characters. We now get a new villain who opposes Miles, with his motives being very clear. He also is a bit comedic in the first half, though he gets taken more seriously later on. It wouldn't be exciting to have an antagonist with no real threat.Gwen Stacy plays a more important role in this movie, which we clearly needed. I'm glad the movie showed a bit more of what she was going with post-Into the Spiderverse. Instead of having a 30 second clip summarising her story, we have a 30 minute beauty telling her storyWe're also introduced to other such as new character, Miguel (Spider-man 2099), Hobbie (Spider Punk), Mumbai's spider-man, and so on. I cannot dive deep into these characters because it would spoil a lot of the movie. Though, I enjoyed that all the different spider-man had their own animation style. This here is something we're going to see time and time again in the next movie.The animation doesn't seem like a can of spray paint painted across, it isn't too fast and you can see what is going on. All you do is sit there and admire the movie and its fantastic animation, it looks and feel like music going through not your ears, but your eyes. Now I get why this here movie was being delayed. The soundtrack is nearly as good, and helps really drive the intensity of much of the scenes. Just take a look, and listen to the soundtrack. I promise to you won't regret it.The only down part is the ending, it makes this movie feel like a too long intro to the next. Also because it hypes you up for the next movie, by having the scene near the ending be so good and exciting.I can't really complain because everything else was done so good.Overall: The Animation, The characters, the story, the Soundtrack, the movie is all executed beautifully. 10/10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","talking_about_movies","3 June 2023","Let me warn you guys beforehand, this is sort of the 1st part of a 2-part story. Spiderman: Beyond The Spiderverse will arrive in March 2024.This movie was just downright brilliant. There's no other way to put it. I absolutely love the confidence with which this movie has been made. I don't just mean the style of the movie, because man, is it stylish. I also mean the time it takes to tell it's story. That's the confidence. To be sure about the time you want to take to tell a story that you think is going to be great, and not worry about whether some audience is going to lose interest or not. Because I do think that some people are going to be put off by the slowness of the 1st half. And it is admittedly slow. But I don't mind it at all. If any story deserved a slow pace it was this one. And when this movie speeds up, it really speeds up - One action set piece after another, lots of hilarious jokes thrown at you at high speed.They take their sweet time to build their characters and their problems. To make them as relatable as possible. I thought they nailed that. They understood the struggles of being spiderman - Having 2 identities, not being able to talk to anyone about it, hearing criticisms, unsure of what the right thing to do is - That's what made this movie so relatable. This time I was able to really root for Miles because of the time this movie took to explain his struggles, something I thought was rushed in the 1st movie.The soundtrack is brilliant, the direction is brilliant and the animation is one of the best in modern times. Like I said, this movie is STYLISH, just like the 1st one. There are a couple of action scenes here that are so, so thrilling, I could barely sit still. The plot twists towards the end were great too.Watch this movie in theatres guys, it deserves your money. And you're going to have a spectacular time, trust me. As of now, this might be the best movie I've seen this year. I'm just over the moon by the fact that we are getting such a great franchise. This truly is the perfect summer blockbuster.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ethiotst-53110","5 June 2023","Greatest animated film is not a title I would give out lightly. It is up against some amazing films, like Wall-E, Toy Story, How to train your dragon 2, Up (pretty much most pixar movies). But Across the Spiderverse easily beats those films, something I never thought I would say.Animation/art style.The strongest part of this film is the animation. Every shot is this beautiful frame with so much going on. The comic book style animation just like the first film is excellently utilised. It is simply one of the most cinematic movies, and such a beautiful film, it really proves that animated films can be just as good as live action and not ""just for kids"".Story.Can't say too much without spoiling the movie but the story is super intriguing and explores some very interesting themes that the first film introduced but didn't really tackle all that much. It creates quite an emotional ride at times and the 'problem' that drives the plot forward is a really good one and simple yet unique idea even if it is introduced well into the movie.Characters.The characters are really developed past the funny bit that introduces the characters in the first film. Gwen's backstory is explored giving us more emotional investment in the film. Miles is funny and cool as ever, keeping his slight awkwardness.One of the antagonist (if you can really call him one) has a very justified motive that most people would agree with, all but Miles, this is why you can't really call him a bad guy per se.The true antagonist gas a really cool design, costume and character wise, his backstop is goofy and his introduction is too but he evolves throughout the film into this really cool villain.Side characters are interesting especially one of them that is all about going against the establishment.Background characters were honestly one of this movies strengths, there were so many characters that showed up even for a second or two that made me gasp and gave me a huge grin, don't want spoil any as part of the enjoyment from this film are the different spidermen you meet.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","kxqpmnzt","2 June 2023","I was worried that the follow-up to what is my favorite movie would fall short, as is the case so often. But even still, I went in with high expectations and they were ABSOLUTELY met. Dare I say this is even better than the first? Animation was innovative and spectacular, script was whip smart and clever as hell, character development surpassed most live-action films, and there were twists and turns all along the way.What made the first so great was built upon in this movie, but they did it in a smart, thoughtful way. I'm remarkably excited for Beyond the Spider-Verse to be released to see how this story ends!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","quiqueperezsoler","31 May 2023","The writers behind the Spiderverse movies are some of the best of our time. Not only do they know how to craft a unique, high-staked, deeply personal and riveting story, but their respect for the legacy of Spider-Man is beyond perfect.And that's all it takes, folks. For everyone and anyone whose working on preestablished franchises (Star Wars, Marvel, DC...), who want to follow up the adventures or stories in a robustly-built universe, all you need is to ""read up"". To understand what makes it work and use those strengths to your advantage.This movie is one of the best Spider-man stories I have ever seen. It's unlike any other told in the comics and movies, it's fresh, provocative (in the good way) and all out bonkers. Needless to say, the animation is top notch. I mean, Sony Animation Studios has developed into a powerhouse of stylised animation. It already showed in the trailers, but if you liked the different styles used in the animation of each spiderperson from other universe, you are going to have a fieldtrip with this one.Almost everything works in this movie, the comedy, the set pieces, the world-building, the emotional and dramatic moments. It's simply top tier cinema, not animated cinema alone, but overall cinema. The romantic tension, the new character's personalities and relationships, it's all around perfect, I would not change a thing.There's so many pros that I don't think I can put into words the amount of things this movie does right. The long action scenes, animation style, sound design and soundtrack, the script, the characterisation of old and new spider people. I have only praises for this movie. But the biggest one is what I said previously, the respect and understanding of the mythos and lore of Spider-man is what saves this movie for the bigger fans. Because Spider-man is not a hard story to adapt, but there's a lot of good stuff in it and the way the writters play with preestablished media and introducing new media to the people while not being too much to handle for the audience is brilliant.There're references for everyone, for those who saw only the movies, or the shows, or the games, or the tv shows, or the comics. I don't want to jump into spoilers, I just want to point out all the good qualities this movie has, that carries from the previous and some which are improved and amped to the max.Just the ambition of the story they are trying to tell here already surpases any and all expectations. I whole-heartedly believe they are breaking grounds here and they are changing the way the Spider-man universe works and I applaud their fantastic work. I hope the next one fulfills the catharsis that left me wanting more after the credits roled in this one.If anything, and I mean very mildly ruined the experience for me, that is, I lowered from a 10/10 to a 9/10, was two aspects that bugged me more than I expected. One of them is, you can tell this movie was divided in two while you watch it: the pacing is a bit slow in some scenes, action scenes that drag just a bit too much some times or emotional scenes that go on when all that was meant to be said was done. And the other aspect is, and this may be a bit spoilery, so if you don't wanna read more NOW IS THE TIME NOT TO READ MORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED:I think the prologue and recap of the previous movie at the beginning of this one wasn't too.. right. It threw me off a bit just because they went on for too long, like they tried to flesh out the background story of someone and, despite how this comes back full circle in the end, it just carries on and on it's a bit too long before we get to where everyone is. Also, and this is last spoilery thing, I feel there's a bit of a flaw of continuity when Gwen ""comes back to see Miles"", like between the ending of the previous movie, and this one. They didn't connect it too well I think (ahem, Miles seems different).","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","aarathiajit-02903","1 July 2023","A good movie is something that entertains you at the moment. A great movie is one that stays with you way after the screen turns black. Never have I felt this passionately about a superhero movie before. Every frame was breathtaking. The use of colour to convey each emotion was phenomenal. It was a rollercoaster of emotions with a soundtrack that did not stop amazing me. The humour, the wit, the subtle messaging, I could watch this one a million times. My personal favourite scenes where the one with Gwen and her dad and the one with Gwen and Miles pictured to Monalisa. But the whole movie was remarkable. It truly won my heart.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","1 June 2023","The MCU's struggling to find new focus on anything post Avengers: Endgame, and this film is probably THE ideal blueprint for how other filmmakers can tackle the all-encompassing wackiness of multiverses, especially with a character as beloved and established as Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse was originally a Part I, but then Part II became Beyond The Spider-Verse (which is due next year), and it's clear these films are becoming the Toy Story equivalent for animated superhero cinema. The characterisations are air-tight, the screenplay knows the difference between metaphysical craziness and intimate character arcs, and the animation goes above and beyond in terms of remixing itself with SOOOO many different styles and vibes.First and foremost, the primary story focuses on Miles and Gwen, and how the Spider-Verse is making their lives all the more crazy and larger than they ever dreamed of. And it's also about making peace with their vigilante careers, and accepting that they're part of something bigger than Spider-Man alone. And nothing's getting in the way of compromising who they are deep down: compassionate heroes who'd risk themselves for the greater good.A sequel that's bolder and bigger than its already great precursor, Into The Spider-Verse, that this film leaves you wanting more in the BEST way possible. And this cliffhanger: it's a doozy. It brings the film's arcs to a close yet leaves them open enough that they'll lend themselves to Beyond The Spider-Verse (hopefully) rather nicely.Across The Spider-Verse is even crazier than Into The Spider-Verse, and it manages to complement the film rather than 'overtake' it in terms of relevance. Here's hoping Beyond The Spider-Verse delivers what it promises us.I give Across the Spider-Verse 10/10 IMDb points. 5/5 stars.P. S. This film's craziness... needs to be SEEN to be believed! Hell, this might be THE proverbial metaphysical film of 2023.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a hyperactive techno-dream of super-heroic proportions, and it's the (presumably) penultimate chapter of The Spider-Verse Saga. And what a Saga it is so far!Spider-Man's easily one of cinema's most iconic superheroes and he's had to endure some REAL triumphs and headaches along the way (for every Spider-Man 2, there's an Amazing Spider-Man 2). And Across The Spider-Verse is another defining chapter in Spider-Man's storied legacy on the big screen.This one's gonna have some strong praise for it, and there's gonna be detractors saying it's not as well-rounded as the first (both situations are understandable), but what the film does right it does it in proud strides. It's like an arthouse Spider-Man film that knows fan-service has its own depths of character and history, and the lines between animation and live-action are virtually non-existent in the Spider-Verse.For such a tried-and-true character like Spider-Man, it's pretty damn surprising and refreshing the Spider-Verse films are as solid as they are. Sure some of the world building may have SOME plot-holes regarding the machinations of multiverse logic, but its playbook is easily the most creative one in cinema today. And by far the nuttiest too.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is running laps around its competition right now, and it's one of those rare examples where a sequel deserves every ounce of praise it gets. Toy Story had that same magic (up to Toy Story 3); now Spider-Man's Spider-Verse is taking its crown.Rock-solid story, chaotic visuals and deep characters that are bigger than one universe alone. 10/10 IMDb points. 5/5 stars.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","southdavid","10 June 2023","I really loved ""into the Spiderverse"" and so this sequel is one that I've been looking forward to for a while. I'm so happy that it doesn't disappoint and even manages to improve on almost every aspect from the first.Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is invited to join ""The Spider Society"" after helping Spiderman 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and Jessica Drew (Issa Rae) defeat a Renaissance variant Vulture (Jorma Tacccone) in her world. The Spider Society jump between universes fixing anomalies. Months later, she comes back to Miles Morales' (Shameik Moore) world, tracking The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) a villain able to utilise holes in space to commit crimes. Though specifically told not to, she makes contact with Miles and drags him to another universe with disastrous consequences.It's a great story. Clever and well thought through and allowing for great deal of both humour and pathos. There are hundreds of Spiderman variants in the film, most are played for laughs and can have little more than a few seconds screentime, but some are key, such as Hobie - The Spider-Punk variant from England voiced by Daniel Kaluuya or Spiderman India voice by Karan Soni. The main variants from the last film don't really re-appear, until the very end of the movie - with the exception of Peter B Parker - voiced again by Jake Johnson.But visually the film is a step up too, something that I wouldn't have thought possible. The blending of various different animation styles is amazingly well done. How the interactions between these characters work is staggering. It's a genuine joy to just to look at something that this much effort has gone into and is this dynamic.I can't imagine for a second that this won't be very close to my best film of the year, come December. It's certainly the one to beat.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","evansjoshyr","25 June 2023","The spiderverse movies truly are not only some of the best superheroes and animated movies, but simply some of the best movies of all time. They are such a spectacle to behold, pushing the boundaries of animation with every frame, but never forgetting to provide an engaging story with so much depth and heart to every character.Across the spiderverse is bigger and bolder than the previous entry. There is so much fan service and so much happening at once it can be hard to keep track of it on a first viewing. It wasn't until a second viewing that I began to appreciate and respect the care and love that went into every scene of this movie. It had an unpredictable story and ended in a way that will make you wish beyond the spiderverse was here right now. These movies are modern masterpieces and we are lucky to be able to witness them spectacularly unfold.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","lisafordeay","3 June 2023","Spiderman Across The Spidey Verse is the sequel to the 2018 film Spiderman Into The Spidey Verse(2018).The movie stars Shailek Moore,Hailee Steinfeld and Jason Schwartzmann. Gwen Stacey(Steinfeld) now Spider Woman teams up with Miles Morales in a different universe to take out the sneaky Spot(Schwartzmann) who seeks revenge on Miles. Will they save New York City from Spot? Or will they get help from other Spidermen from the different universes?Overall I thought it was a very good movie. Just like the original it has beautiful animation styled like a comic book,the story was engaging and the voice acting was top notch. I guess the only complaint is that the film is very long especially an animated film as they are usually on for 80 minutes or 104 minutes.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","danizull","4 July 2023","Trust me when i say this this is my first 10/10 rating animation in films! It exceeded my expectations, honestly i had lower expectation due to not a big fan of any animation film, but this suprises me, looking forward for the sequel.Spiderverse shattered all my preconceived notions about animation films, leaving me awestruck and craving for more. From the very first scene to the final credits, this movie delivered a breathtaking visual experience that was simply unmatched. The attention to detail, vibrant colors, and innovative animation techniques made every frame a work of art.What truly set Spiderverse apart was its unique storyline and compelling characters. The film brilliantly introduced us to a multiverse of Spider-Men and Spider-Women, each with their own distinct personality and backstory. It was a joy to witness the diverse cast of characters coming together, forming an unlikely team of heroes who were relatable and deeply human.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","JackRJosie","16 July 2023","I want to be a part of the crowd that says they're done with superhero movies. There's a little superiority complex there. Although I believe superhero flicks are destroying the film industry, they are so dang fun. Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse is unlike any superhero movie you will probably ever see. It's surely not your run of the mill. Perhaps films like this bring serious innovation to the big screen rather then destruction! I believe it so, as this film is unlike anything I've ever seen before.The animation is unreal, so creative and mind blowing that human being are even capable of creating this kind of 2D art! It's a seriously impressive film artistically speaking, and the brilliance doesn't end there.After watching the first spider verse film you would think they wrapped up a good thing, but they carry on this Miles Morales story in a really good way. This story is so fresh and exciting that it had 'e staring at the screen in disbelief (and sensory overload) with my jaw to the floor. So unbelievably fun and creative.See this film. Twice probably. Can't wait for #3.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","taylandeng","5 June 2023","The movie was incredible, with outstanding graphics, hooking story line, and incredible building to the previous film. The is outright the best
""Spider-Verse"" animated movie out currently. If you plan on watching, make sure to bring large sized bucket of joy and a fizzling soda full of adventure. Not only is the movie great to watch alone, this PG film will be a movie loved by families watching. If you enjoyed the previous, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" this will bring you into a shock with how incredible the movie is.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","adityabagri-67458","2 June 2023","""Across the Spider-Verse"" introduces an extraordinary ensemble of characters that truly make the film shine. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is undeniably the best CBM of 2023, its not even close(taste of all mid af cbms like gotg3,antman3 and shazam 2 is washed away) thanks to its exceptional characters, a compelling storyline, emotional depth, and a cliffhanger that leaves us hungry for more. Spider-Punk, with his rebellious spirit and unique punk-inspired appearance, brings a fresh and exciting energy to the story. Pavitr Prabhakar, the Spider-Man of India. His presence not only expands the Spider-Verse but also adds depth to the story as what canon is what is supposed to happen and what is not in the spiderverse. Ben Rileytake on the Spider-Man mythology. Spider-Gwen to impress with her dynamic and empowering portrayal. Her qrelatable vulnerabilities, and growth as a hero make her an incredibly likable and compelling character and her journey is quiet great in the movie. Of course, the heart of the story remains with Miles Morales, whose growth as a hero continues to impress. Miles' journey of self-discovery, responsibility, and finding his own voice within the Spider-Verse is masterfully portrayed. His relatability, vulnerability, and undeniable charm make him a character that audiences genuinely care about and root for. Peter B. Parker in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" not only shines as a hero but also as a great husband, mentor, and father figure. His portrayal as a loving and supportive husband to Mary Jane Watson, and as a caring mentor and father figure to Mayday Parker, is truly commendable. Together, these characters form a rich tapestry that sparks genuine emotional investment from viewers. Their individual arcs and interactions create a dynamic ensemble that balances moments of humor, heart, and intense action. The chemistry among the characters is palpable, enhancing the storytelling and making the Spider-Verse feel alive and vibrant.Furthermore, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" excels in delivering a gripping and well-crafted storyline. The narrative takes viewers on an exhilarating journey through multiple dimensions, filled with unexpected challenges and confrontations with an array of villains. The story seamlessly weaves together themes of self-discovery, responsibility, and the importance of family, creating a tapestry of depth and emotion. The film strikes a perfect balance between thrilling action sequences and poignant character-driven moments, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish.Let's not forget the jaw-dropping cliffhanger that leaves us eagerly anticipating the next installment. It leaves us with burning questions, heightened anticipation, and an insatiable desire to witness what comes next in this intricate web of storytelling.","3/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ethanbresnett","2 July 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is such a complete sequel and a more than worthy successor to Into the Spider-Verse.Visually it is such a stunningly rich film, full of vibrancy and creativity. The different worlds are individually crafted to feel unique which makes the film that much more absorbing. The various animation and artistic styles that are used really bring the characters and situations to life. The uses of colour are intriguing and tell a story all on their own. Visually this film is just a real treat.But that's not to say this film is style over substance, because the story is strong throughout. It has pace and drive that really propels things forward, and for such a far reaching story it is handled really well. It never feels like it is overreaching or too padded out, and the runtime breezes by.Another string to its bow is its balance of humour and drama. Lately a lot of superhero films try to be both funny and serious, and the humour ends up undercutting the drama and emotion of the story. Spider-Verse manages to do both exceedingly well. It is a funny film that also packs some powerful emotional and dramatic punches, balancing these two tones very well.To top it all off, the film has a terrific score that further heightens all of the visual and narrative themes to make for a very complete and well rounded film.Just a terrific experience all around!","9/10"

They used all the graphic styles are out there.I cannot even describe how I enjoyed watching this masterpiece.I have to watch it at least 5 more times to find some words say something. I'm literally speechless.I felt I needed 4 more brains to process the graphic (x2), story, and dialogs.I am kinda suspicious that this movie is created by AI. It's out of human brain domain. At least my brain.But watching it was supper satisfying. When the movie finished I was sad just because it was finished, I wanted more. I'm excited to see the third part.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ThereelscoopwithKK","3 July 2023","After quite enjoying the first one and seeing all the hype about this one I was quite confident I'd enjoy this sequel. Unfortunately I was stunned by the product in the end. The first movie to me developed very likable characters through really good dialogue. Instead of growing these characters further they became much more bland and the conversations stale.There is no real introduction to the villain at all and you just get thrown into this seemingly endless battle chase scene. It also looks like the movie really wants to be 3D but they ultimately decided against it. Ultimately the graphics became annoying and just gave both people in my party a headache.The movie might be great for super-fans of Spider-Man as you will certainly get your fix in the Spider-verse, but if he's not exactly your favourite superhero it is a bit exhausting.The ending did have me intrigued with the direction they're headed nevertheless.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","alessandro_sp","17 August 2023","As with the first film but upping the ante a notch, this sequel reinstates the choices made before. Sony has made such a genious move. They developed a style on their own, which cannot be plagiarized without backfiring on whoever does it. Bold, successful move. Haven't seen something like this since What dreams may come (1998).And it's not a case of all looks and no substance either. The story backs the visuals, and it wasn't until 15 minutes from the end that I noticed the movie wouldn't wrap in this installment. The pace, story and cinematic choices really draw you into it, so much so that you don't notice time passing by.If I have only one criticism is that in fact pace is so fast that one might miss several references or jokes. Other than that, congratulations on Sony and Marvel for setting new and higher standards.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jordyntsmith","7 June 2023","Miles Morales gets into the Spiderverse again. The stakes are higher, the emotions are stronger, and life is harder - things we all identify with.While this movie was highly anticipated, I feared it would be over hyped. Into the Spiderverse seemed perfect - a fantastic standalone movie that a sequel has the potential to ruin. BUT, Across the Spiderverse does it. It masterfully continues where the original picked up, connecting lose ends, and expanding the franchise seemlessly. Somehow, this film grounds the multiverse trope with its focus on human emotion, themes of loss, finding your purpose, and coming of age. Miles and Gwen are characters I really shouldn't identify with, but I do. Their stories and feelings are compelling, and what make this soon to be trilogy so special.Go watch it. Though it may be too intense for some littles, this movie (and the first one) are must-see.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","mrashtastic89","11 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a marvel masterpiece, and a top 5 comic book movie of all time, the first one is one of my favorite movies ever, and that goes for this entry too. What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? It is a striking masterpiece, both visually and ethereally, it is absolutely phenomenal in every single way.I have no words for how exquisite this animation is, it improves on the original in so many vastly various ways, the colors pop off of the screen and these workers put their all into it, there are very few movies I've seen that look this good, actually, there's only one.Shameik Moore is absolutely incredible in this movie, Miles's character arc is done to perfection and Miguel O'Hara's backstory was absolutely masterful, this film managed to fit in almost every single piece of Spider-Man media in just 2 hours and 16 minutes, including frickin Spectacular Spider-Man and an insane amount of other things.And the ending cliffhanger was absolutely jaw-dropping, I wish I could build a time machine to take me to the release date of Beyond the Spider-Verse.Across the Spider-Verse is one of the best comic book and marvel movies of all time, and one of my favorite movies that's ever been made, this gets an A double plus.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","nicolasroop","2 June 2023","Not just in his character, but the way his story is interwoven with the entire spidey-verse is just plain genius. The amount of callbacks and references throughout was a delight, and none of it felt forced. Everything flowed naturally with the story. Some are saying the film is a bit too long. I disagree. I would've sat there for another 2 hours just to see how this story is going to end, and what else they could've done with this art style. My booty would've been sore, but my mind would've been a happy camper! If you do decide to see this, which you 100% should (it may be the best film of the year, but still too early to tell), see it in the IMAX format. It's absolutely breathtaking and you can really see the attention to detail put into the absolutely jaw dropping artwork on display here. Overall, I highly recommend it. Bring the whole family. You'll be enchanted by the story, while the kids will be distracted by the artwork and awesome chase sequences.5 spideys out of 5.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","diogomouraviegas","25 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning animated film that brings together multiple Spider-people from different dimensions. The film is a continuation of the first Spider-Verse movie, and it certainly delivers on the hype. From the opening scene, the film immerses its audience in a vibrant and colorful multiverse where anything is possible.The animation is one of the best things about the film. It's a mix of traditional hand-drawn animation and computer-generated graphics, creating an eye-catching visual style that perfectly captures the comic book feel of the Spider-Man universe. The attention to detail in the animation also extends to the character design and the backgrounds, making every scene a feast for the eyes.The voice cast is also top-notch. Shameik Moore returns as Miles Morales, and Jake Johnson reprises his role as Peter B. Parker. New additions include Issa Rae as Spider-Woman, Hailee Steinfeld as Spider-Gwen, and other talented actors who bring their unique flair to their respective Spider-characters.Aside from the animation and the story, the soundtrack is another highlight of the film. The score by Daniel Pemberton is a thrilling and exciting mix of orchestral and electronic music that perfectly complements the action-packed scenes. The film also features a variety of popular songs, from Post Malone's ""Sunflower"" to Lil Nas X's ""Montero,"" adding another layer to the film's already impressive audiovisual experience.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is simply one of the best animated films ever made.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","LansTaylor","6 June 2023","First and foremost, 'Across the Spider-Verse' features animation that is nothing short of spectacular. It pushes the envelope by combining diverse artistic mediums and methods to provide a feast for the eyes. Each frame is a piece of art, with incredible attention to detail, vivid colors, and exciting action scenes. It is simply amazing to see the degree of imagination and skill on show. All the props to the animation team, you guys deserve the inevitable Oscars to coming your way!The plot itself is extremely interesting how it explores new realities and introduces intriguing Spider-Man varieties while diving deeper into the multiverse theory that was previously established in the first film. It was exciting to see established heroes and newcomers, each with special abilities and personalities all come together. The dialogue is witty, and heartfelt, and shows a genuine understanding of what makes Spider-Man such a relatable character.This sequel is a complete accomplishment that serves as a monument to the power of narrative and the virtually endless potential of animation. It's a movie that will speak to viewers of all ages and have a lasting impact. When the ending card appeared, I couldn't believe it had already been over two hours. I'm glad I didn't see spoilers to what the ending card revealed because I could've sat there for another two hours if possible.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","wolfsong1611","16 August 2023","It was a decent movie sequel to the last one but...This might be an unpopular opinion but I'm not a fan of the spider verse type of animation. It was cool and unique at first in part 1 but the undefined and blurry edges and glitching is really a strain on my brain. It cannot be good for anyone who suffers from epilepsy.It's like they took everyone's version of each scene and just superimposed them so there are like 3 colours in each edge and several edges and no one has colored within the lines!It was also really loud and glitchy.Getting a bit tired of extremely disobedient child superheroes too. Guess I'm just too old school.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","DarkVulcan29","12 June 2023","A lot of films seem to be exploring multiverses, and superhero films are no exception. An awesome follow up.

And not to mention the awesome voices to the characters bring incredible life to the characters.I liked the look of the other spider man from other universes. And Miles and Gwen really click, you buy there connection like from the first one. Still hoping for a live action Miles Morales and Spider Gwen movies. I like the main villain, you feel bad for him, and you understand why he does what he does. I'm really looking forward to the next film, it has an ending like The Empire Strikes Back(1980).","8/10"

Takes so many chances and everyone works perfectly. It's so wholesome, sad, unique, stunning, and funny. It's a great setup for the next movie and if that one is nearly as good then this trilogy could be considered not just one of the best in animation but one of the best trilogies ever made period. You can take any frame of this movie and turn it into a poster. There isn't anything that I would change. It is by far the best spiderman movie and easily the best marvel movie.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","timeblank","8 June 2023","I felt a bit lost watching this fast-paced movie with great animation, as some of the odd animation made me dizzy. The first half mainly focuses on Gwen and her encounter with Spider-man 2099. Although I may have missed the tragedy in her universe, the movie expands the Spiderverse and introduces The Spot as a new villain, shedding new light on Miles Morales as the new Spider-man. The scene to keep an eye out for is when Miles is bitten by the spider, leading to a shocking conclusion that will permanently alter him. Overall, this film is a continuation, and I'm excited for the next installment.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","demonblade-37792","5 June 2023","The first impression of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is that the cinematography is visually stunning. The artwork and animations of the characters and backgrounds are pleasing to watch. Kudos to the artist team who put the hard work in. I loved how we saw almost and if not every Spider-Person from all the universes. My personal favorite was Spider-Punk being played by Daniel Kaluuya because he is a punk-rock character, but also still chill and nonchalant at the same time. It was glad seeing Miles Morales (Shamiek Moore) back in action as his and also Spider-Gwen's (Hailee Steinfield) stories dissolve all into one movie. It was nice to see that we have strong antagonists being played by Spot (Jason Schwartzman) and Spider-Man 2099/ Miguel O' Hara (Oscar Isaac). Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is great with its voice acting, cinematography, and the story. I would recommend watching it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","maceman1220","5 June 2023","Haven't been able to stop thinking about this since I saw it earlier today, already planning my next viewing (this time in IMAX, was only able to see it normal tonight).I had a great time with the first film. It was fresh, exciting, full of heart, and just an excellent experience. But man, as of now, this just knocks it out of the water.To start, the animation. Oh the animation. The first film was breathtaking, introduced a new style of animation that was so unique and felt so connected to the story. Now, after watching this film, it feels like my first time seeing it. The animation and how it's infused into the storytelling is on a whole other level. The use of color and so many different art styles is truly mesmerizing. To me, this feels like the first animated film I've seen to truly use the medium to the fullest extent capable.Beyond the visuals, the story and characters are just so rich. The cast is exceptional, and the focus on the human drama adds so much weight to every big moment. Every action scene hits so much harder because you care about these people and you understand why they're fighting. There's so much emotional weight carried through every moment. I especially loved the focus on Gwen. You really see so much of the film through her eyes and her story is so deep and heartbreaking.Also, beyond the emotion, the film is HILARIOUS. So many incredible jokes, visual gags, hilarious cameos. Started coughing laughing in a few scenes. Also shout-out to Hobie being one of the baddest (in the best way possible) dudes I've ever seen onscreen.Yes, it's definitely part one. It ends on a massive cliffhanger. My feelings on this film may change if the next doesn't stick the landing, but from the quality on display here, I have nothing but faith. I didn't want it to end, I could've sat through the next film immediately after this without as much as a bathroom break. I would've stayed all night in that theater.This genuinely feels like nothing I've really seen before, one of the only films I can compare it to is Everything Everywhere All At Once for shear imagination on display. It's one of the best superhero films I've seen, one of the greatest animated films I've ever seen, one of the best movies I've seen these last few years, and it's gonna be a long 9 months till part 2.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","amrock15494","30 October 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a stunning sequel to the Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) that takes the animation and storytelling to new heights. The film follows Miles Morales, a teenager from Brooklyn who has become the new Spider-Man, as he travels across different dimensions with Gwen Stacy, his friend and fellow Spider-Person. Along the way, they meet other versions of Spider-Man, such as Miguel O'Hara from 2099, Jessica Drew from an alternate Earth, and Ben Reilly, a clone of Peter Parker. Together, they form the Spider-Society, a team of heroes dedicated to protecting the multiverse from a mysterious villain known as the Spot, who can create portals between worlds.The film is a visual feast that showcases the creativity and diversity of the Spider-Verse. Each universe has its own distinct style and tone, ranging from futuristic cyberpunk to retro noir to anime-inspired. The animation is fluid and dynamic, with seamless transitions and stunning action sequences. The film also pays homage to various Spider-Man comics, movies, and TV shows, with references and Easter eggs that will delight fans of all ages.The film also has a strong emotional core that explores the themes of identity, responsibility, and friendship. Miles Morales is a relatable and likable protagonist who struggles with balancing his personal life and his superhero duties. He also faces challenges and conflicts with his new allies, who have different perspectives and methods on how to be a hero. The film shows how Miles grows and learns from his experiences, and how he ultimately defines what it means to be Spider-Man. The film also highlights the bond between Miles and Gwen, who share a mutual attraction and respect for each other.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece of animation and storytelling that expands and enriches the Spider-Verse saga.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","healingtoolbox","6 June 2023","Probably the most on-point, on-time zeitgeist expression since, well, 2018's Spiderverse film.The high point of wonders here for me comes late in the 2nd act when Miles and his mom talk alone. The mom is the most successful animated character in this film. The film goes on for another 20 minutes of wonderful lyrical visuals. Then I lost track of the plot almost completely. How a multiverse is affected by tangled webs of various Spider-people didn't work as an emotional thru-line for me.ANIMATION JAZZ returns! Animation nerds will know many effects here hark back to animation experiments in the 1950s-1960s of John and Faith Hubley et al. Generally these old pretentious visual effects are put to much better story use here--if several times overdone to the point of sensory overload.DC comics fans will note the Green Lantern Corps clearly inspired the Spider-person Corps here. Be ready for several jolting new spider-personas. I liked their choices.This is another movie which would play longer in theaters if 20 minutes of bloat was cut out; in this case, from end of 2nd act.","6/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","cardsrock","7 June 2023","It's truly incredible how good of a follow-up this is to one of the best comic book films ever. The fact they managed to craft this compelling of a story without it feeling forced is amazing. I was full invested in everything happening and couldn't believe the end of the film came so soon. That; however, would be the one aspect holding me back from a perfect score, as this almost feels like an incomplete film given the lack of resolution with Miles' story. However, Gwen is arguably the co-lead of the film and she gets some nice resolution with her arc.Speaking of Gwen, the visuals utilized for her world were truly out of this world. Having the colors of the world sync with her emotions really gave this a unique feel. The rest of the visuals in the film were of course exquisite as well.There are SO many nods and references to Spider-Man across media and I loved every second of it. Lord and Miller continue their impeccable track record of clever writing with genuinely funny dialogue. I hope we see more of Miguel O'Hara in the sequel, as he is a fascinating character superbly voiced by Oscar Isaac. I must also make note of the incredible score. It might be even better than the first film with its whirlwind of electric sounds and vibes.Across the Spider-Verse stands as one of the best sequels ever and one of the best comic book films of all time. I really cannot recommend this film enough if you're interested in going on an incredible multi-versal journey full of heart and soul.","10/10"

I was looking forward to this new installment but very disappointing that it was a long movie without an ending.Suddenly, in the last 20 minutes, when the energy was going up to a 10, from an 8, and more and more complexity was being introduced.. I knew it. I can't believe they are doing it to animated movies now ('cartoons'). Why is the movie not feeling like I will have the itch scratched. 'to be continued..' .. knew it!!Not cool to do that, especially when they introduced more and more open loops. To do it with animated movies now?

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","vishalmellark","4 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse strikes the perfect chord, like a symphony of web-slinging hilarity. It swings through the cinematic landscape with impeccable pacing, juggling character development and action like a circus performer on caffeine. The voice acting is A-grade, with Isaac brooding so intensely that I could swear his voice could rival thunder. Hailee Steinfeld shines as Gwen, blending her previous roles into a cocktail of awesomeness. And let's not forget Moore, who's simply ""freaking amazing"" as Morales, showcasing maturity and immaturity in a way that would make even a hormonal spider proud. The storytelling is as fresh as a spider web spun by a hipster arachnid, blending nostalgia, comedy, and superheroism in a way that leaves you saying, ""Wow, superheroes can be deep and funny!"" The comedy is a riot, hitting you with more punchlines than a spider web has sticky threads, and the nostalgia and Easter eggs are like a treasure hunt for cinephiles and comic book aficionados. The action scenes are a step up from the first film, delivering more kicks, flips, and whips than a salsa dancing Spider-Man. The animation and art style are a visual feast, like watching a kaleidoscope of comic book pages come to life in a mind-bending acid trip. Sure, there are a few hiccups along the way, like some forced humor and moments of pacing hiccups, but hey, nobody's perfect, not even Spider-Man. The ending may drag on a bit, like that one friend who can't take a hint to leave the party, but it's still a wild ride that'll make you want to spin back for more. So grab your popcorn, slip into your Spidey suit, and get ready for an adventure that'll make you laugh, cheer, and leave you itching for the next installment. Spider-fans, this one's for you!","1/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","sevskirita","8 October 2023","This one certainly took some time to process, especially since it's not all said and done and there's a sequel in the works to make the theme more clearly with an ending.But I think I got it. The first movie's theme was about finding faith in yourself, I think this one is about being consistently faithful to what you know is right.All our main spider characters from last time are being told that doing the right thing and saving their loved ones from a death they know is coming is wrong and will cause reality to collapse. A microcosm of this is Gwen's small completed arc, which has her being told that she should give herself up to her father despite it meaning that she and the entire city will be punished for her good deeds. Instead, she persisted in doing the right thing, saving others and appealing to her father even when it seemed fruitless.Miguel is the true villain of this film, and represents the inverse. He has persisted in doing the wrong thing, whether that be deceiving his replacement theory or forcing others to allow people to die because ""the continuum"" (which will likely be revealed to be something about how he lost his replacement theory that Miguel misunderstood or didn't know or look for for a workaround). We will likely see in the future film how this was a mistake and will turn out poorly for Miguel and the people who he decided to protect. Dark Miles will no doubt be an extension of this.Current Miles' family situation is already an extension of these themes. He persists in doing the right thing (Spider-man duties), but it's derailing his family life. The reason is because he doesn't do the right thing consistently enough. He should be honest with his family, but his fear and fear of the presumably false dichotomy Miguel and Gwen present him with of it not turning out well prevents him from doing what he knows is right.A really good thematic framework but boy is this movie so much more than that. The tension throughout the moment we discover canon events to the very end, the sadness of Miguel's treatment of Miles and the sadness of Gwen trying to reach out to her dad was incredible. Whether it be the music, plot, characters, etc etc this movie was always on point and emotionally compelling. I definitely cried during the Gwen scene and geared up when Peter B explains why he had Mayday. After finishing this movie I had to take hours to process it all.It's hard to rate a middle film without getting the entire picture of the wider story it contributes to since it doesn't really have a self-contained ending that will tie up the themes and elucidate the quality of the various beats in this story, but I think how this made me feels deserves nothing less than a 10/10 and I see no issue with anything about this story.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","brandoconner-83700","2 June 2023","The animation was absolutely amazing along with the action and soundtrack. Miles and Gwen definitely feel more fleshed out in this one, however I feel that some of the dialogue gets to be a bit too corny and tries to hard to be quirky. I expected Miguel to have more of a role aside from the final 30 minutes of the movie, same goes for the villain who is introduced with a rushed backstory who only makes 1 more appearance in the entire second half of the movie. I did have a good time watching it and it's by no means a bad movie, just not the ""Masterpiece"" everyone is building it up to be and is certainly not, ""The Greatest Animated Movie Of All Time"".","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","rhbouchard","12 July 2023","The theme that teenagers know better than their parents has been done to death. ""They don't know me"" is also a tired cliche. Lotsa flashes of color seem pointless other than to get the ADHD generation's attention and to stretch out the running time. The first half is rather dreary. The second half is more interesting with more plot twists than an O. Henry anthology, but by then I'd lost interest and resented that they made me sit through the first half. The end is a shameless ""To Be Continued"". You would think the writers would have followed the multiverse underpinning and came up with something more original and succinct.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","hoernkeem","18 August 2023","Eric's Grade: A
'Across the Spider-Verse' is the animated sequel to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse' and is set to be followed by 'Beyond the Spider-Verse'. With Sony's ownership of the Spider-Man character this is their conduit for continuing to tell Spider-Man stories, and, while Peter Parker makes an appearance, this is once again a Miles Morales led story who is probably the most popular non Peter Parker Spidey from the comics. There are numerous recurring roles from the first film foremost among them being Shameik Moore as Miles, Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales and Brian Tyree Henry as Jeff Morales. Notable supporting voice cast includes Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara, Issa Rae as Jess Drew and Jason Schwartzman as the Spot. 'Across the Spider-Verse' uses the same stylized animation and carries over the feel and tone from the first film flawlessly. That achievement is made more impressive by the fact none of the directors are the same from the first film and the only writer that remains the same is Phil Lord. This will certainly land on numerous end of the year lists and is easily a frontrunner for Best Animated Feature. 'Across the Spider-Verse' is a tremendous box office success as well taking in over $680 million at the box office on $100 million budget.We initially encounter Gwen Stacy from the previous film who, in the midst of a battle with an enemy that has spilled over from the multiverse, reveals to her father that she is Spider-Woman. When he shuns her she turns to the Spider-People who have showed up and they grant her acceptance/asylum in there multiverse Spider-society. Meanwhile Miles is doing his Spider-Man thing his way on Earth-1610. He laments the loss of love interest Gwen, has typical awkward teenage interaction with his parents and battles evil super villains with his own brand of Spidey humor mixed in. One such villain is The Spot and is easily foiled by Spider-Man although, little does Miles know, this villain shall return much more powerful, determined and ruthless than before. All of a sudden Gwen returns, but she is a tad stand offish and secretive. Miles discovers that she is part of a secret Spider-Society headed by Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Man 2099. Miles follows Gwen into a portal to the Spider-Society's HQ where he discovers, to his shock, why he has been generally shunned by this society, and why all of a sudden the majority of the Spider-People turn against him. He flees seeking to write his own story and not have it written for him. He flees to save himself and his family. He flees into what he thinks is relative safety until a fairly massive plot twist leads into a cliffhanger ending that will leave fans drooling for the third installment of this series.Holy Spider-People Batman! If you thought the handful of odd Spidey's from 'Into the Spider-Verse' was jarring wait until you encounter a world(dimension?) full of them. There is so much going on in this movie that it is hard to quantify. The action and animation are stellar along with all of the voice cast. There is some genuine, heartfelt emotion that comes through as well with regard to Miles and his family, Gwen and her father and Miles and the Spider Society including Gwen. For the most part the writers do an excellent job of reigning in a very confusing, chaotic subject and keeping it focused and coherent. That said there are a few story elements that don't quite make sense to me. The crux of Miguel's fixed intensity at Miles is that Miles is an anomaly that was never meant to be Spider-Man due to the fact the spider that bit him was from another reality. If that is truly such a bad thing though I have no understanding why Miguel and his transdimensional Spidey task force allow Miles to go unmolested until he literally shows up at Spider HQ. Also if Gwen truly knew what was going on I have no understanding why she ever went back to visit Peter putting him, and the fabric of reality, in tremendous danger. Besides that..... pretty solid. I had a blast with this. I recently re-watched 'Into the Spider-Verse' and loved it more than I remembered. This is essentially more of the same just expanded to the point that it will melt your brain.... In a good way! The twist cliffhanger ending is a stroke of genius that ranks up there with some of the best cliffhanger endings ever in movies. For a two and half hour run time, which is the longest ever for an American animated film, the movie flies by. It would honestly be difficult to make this movie better, and I cannot wait for future Miles Morales content in this wondrous Spider-rific world.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","elhamfirmino","2 June 2023","I went to the premier with high expectations and came back happy with a drill of anticipation for continuation. This film sets completely new standards from which every studio can learn something.FilmAt the beginning we dive into Gwen's world and shockingly you realize in disbelief how the animation has developed after 5 years. The graphics, transitions, transition of specific colors, the movement of the characters, facial expressions and the atmosphere is unbelievably good. I mean the first movie already made you feel you go through a comic, but Across The Spider-Verse is the next level of animation. With approximately 150.000.000$ budget the result is impressive and totally worth it. I loved every bit of it and no 140 minutes didn't fell too long. When the film was over I was like go on do another 2 hours I WANT MORE OF THIS. Huge respect to Chris Miller & Phil Lord and the entire crew for making this possible.The plot no spoilerIt takes place 16 months after the events of the fire movie. Miles Morales is Spider-Man and has to deal with the daily businesses. He struggles to keep his relationship with his parents, always comes late and has little to no time. One day he faces The Spot a new villain and from there I leave you out without spoilers. The Spot fits in this topic and movie so good. He was the right choice. His design is crazy and his motives are so well written.MultiverseI have to say Across The Spider-Verse did catch the Multiverse topic perfectly. MCU needs to note so many things here. It's actually insane how great they showed the possibilities, diversities and complexities of it. For me, they surpassed No Way Home in terms of Multiverse. Of course Animation is a different tool, but still the story telling and how they made you feel like this movie is not only for kids it's actually more complex and for fans and more like for everyone. The concept of that was nailed perfect. You really do not feel twisted or lost like in several MCU Multiverse projects.To come to an conclusion I think it's safe to say this movie is gonna win another Oscar and is so far in a great cinema year for me the best movie. Wow, I'm so grateful for this movie. I want to watch it again. Go to the cinema right now. This is a true masterpiece. 10/10 Genre and overall everything was perfect. The voice actors did an amazing job too.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ryanpersaud-59415","12 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is quite possibly the best sequel I've seen in a LONG time.It not only expands upon the original, but represents an improvement in almost every way. By the way, the original is an excellent, 9/10 film too, so...yeah, this is heavy, heavy praise] The visuals are absolutely STUNNING, so much so that multiple times whilst watching this movie, I thought to myself ""how is this even possible?"" I can't recall the last time a live action movie really made me feel that way. The commitment to comic book aesthetic is incredible and lovingly crafted in each frame; but what's more impressive is that this film has the ambition to go beyond even that: blending 3D animation with live action, 2D animated with 3D, mosaics with moving rotoscoped characters. I can honestly say that I feel lucky to be able to watch films in the 2020s, Across the Spider-Verse represents one of the best examples of technology and artistry coming together to make something unbelievably cool.And, the amazing thing is that all of this visual excellence exists in service of a great story. Narratively, Across the Spider-Verse represents a more mature, high stakes, thoughtful, well constructed instalment of the franchise; the characters are relatable and understandable, their motivations clear as day. There's a real humanity to the story, despite the bombast and multiversal storytelling. At its core, its about family, identity, self-discovery, community...universal themes that anyone could get behind. There are also so many genuinely great performances bringing these characters to life; shout out in particular to Daniel Kaluuya and Oscar Isaac, but honestly, the whole cast is great. They're so good that if you told me the voice actors sat down with the animators and saw what they were supposed to look and move like, I'd believe you.Speaking of movement, the action sequences in this film are truly incredible. The fluidity of the characters' movements, the fantastic editing and use of comic book panels (a really valuable tool to ensure everything can be seen), and aforementioned excellent visual effects stack up with the best live action scenes Hollywood has to offer.I also personally believe a superhero tale is only as good as its villain, and wow, this movie did a fantastic job. I love how Spot (played by the excellent Jason Schwartzmann) initially comes off as a joke, only for his true potential (and power) to slowly be revealed throughout the movie. I kind of wish he was in it longer, but Oscar Isaac's Miguel works as another amazing antagonist as well.And the ENDING. MY GOD. Could this movie have set its sequel up even better? My wife and I were sitting in the theatre, ready for another half hour or so, expecting the climax only to realize when the music began to swell that it was over. I was genuinely so impressed with how well the filmmakers put all the chess pieces on the board for the next one. However, because of that, if there was one thing keeping this movie from being perfect to me, it's that the ending isn't here yet. It still feels like half of a movie, so how this movie really stacks up in the grand scheme of things is unknown until Part II.Into the Spider-Verse represented a revolution in American animation, where the Pixar style commitment to replicating the real world was eschewed in favour of fluid, unapologetic, stylized animation (so much so that Pixar itself is copying Sony Pictures Animation). I feel like Across the Spider-Verse is throwing the gauntlet, passionately arguing that animation could and SHOULD be taken as seriously as live action.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","roaches_97","6 June 2023","Across the Spider Verse is a very solid movie. It's not the masterpiece that the insane hype train would have you believe, but it's very good. As of right now, this movie has a higher IMDb score than some of the greatest movies of all time (Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, all the Lord of the Rings movies) and I don't really think it's deserved. I'm sure it will be a lot better to look back on once part two comes out, but as of right now it does feel like half of a movie. The animation and voice acting are both great, it has good action, and some of the references and visual gags were cool. I would recommend seeing this in the theater, but I'd say wait a few weeks. I saw it opening weekend in a theater packed full of drooling fanboys who cheered at every single reference. It was maybe the worst theater experience I've ever had. I don't think it's as great as the first but it was a good movie.","8/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","moviemanmo973","2 June 2023","The movie does a great job catching the audience up with Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy. While we catch up to what's going on in their lives presently, we are also reminded of the events that took place in the previous film thus connecting both stories into one.Miles is the only Spider-man in his world and is dealing with that inner conflict. At the same time the film shows that Gwen Stacy is dealing with similar feelings. The characters are parallel to one another and even their family dynamics are similar as they deal with the issue of revealing to their families their true identity. This further adds to the idea of the spider-verse and how similar characters are dealing with similar issues although they are still unique.Gwen Stacy's backstory is explained in detail setting up some emotional moments between her and her father making this film feel grounded and relatable. Not only is it emotional but it also sets up perfectly her reason for joining the other Spider-men.Meanwhile Miles's story is used to introduce the new villain ""Spot"". The buildup to this character was very cool because it made the audience view him exactly how Miles Morales did while the movie was taking place. Spot initially felt like a dumb villain but then he turned into a serious threat and the build up to it was perfect.Miguel O'Hara was another cool character introduced in this film and I liked how his story and intentions were used to further explain how the Spider-verse works. He also added to the drama of the story and provided some intense moments throughout the film.There were so many cool cameos but it was done in a unique way that flowed with the story and not for the sake of including it. There are too many variations of Spider-man to mention but they were all very cool, it was a treat every time a different one was on screen. Also, all of the parents in this film felt organic and true to how parents would deal with the situations that were taking place.This film brought back the comic book style from the last film but it added upon it. When the story was taking place in Gwen Stacy's world the animation style was different than in Miles Morales' world and that attention to detail doesn't go unnoticed. This film gushes with style and blossoms with colors. It's just visually stunning all around. The character designs were just pure art especially with characters like Spider-punk and Spider-man India. The voice acting was amazing. All of the voices suited the characters and never felt out of place.This movie had a lot more heart and drama than the first film with an even better story. The conflict in this story is truly gripping and is intensified with each scene. It is all explained in great detail without being complex or convoluted. This movie was also funnier than the last one but it was never forced or took away from what was going on.This movie is entertaining from beginning to end. It will leave you wanting more by the time it ends. This is easily the best film of the year thus far without comparison. It did everything the first film did but better. This was truly a perfect movie.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","afeey","29 June 2023","After the explosion of the super collider, there is a growing threat to all known worlds. The nature, identity and responsibility of being a Spider-person is examined.This is much bigger than the first, and they even manage to address the rare flaws: this time, despite the many universes and literally hundreds of characters, it never loses focus on Miles Morales (Moore, spot-on), and the creative, memorable action scenes are now each completely, not only mostly, unique. Considering what I just described, you might not believe me when I say that somehow this manages to not be completely overwhelming. That they managed to make the concept simultaneously infinite in possibility and yet not let it get overpowering.","4/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","devendralilke","21 August 2023","Miles Morales's story to the next part which traverses through the multiverse. The huge faults create a gigantic messed up cracks and fissures in the symmetrical flow of the timeline. The absolutely astonishing visual style of animation owns this film and teleports it to the place where no other film has reached. This film is bonkers in catering countless creative choices in its every fascinating frame, each looks like a spectacle at best. The graphics and artwork creatively screams and mellows us with its perfect comic style representation. The mega chase sequence with the spider society is an amusing ride. The action sequences are rushing pulses which standout and validify the reason why we shall blow our minds in front of the big screen. The creation team and art team of this film outperforms the first installment and establishes a benchmark for the future of animation. The humour and emotions find a way in this splendid world. The storytelling and narration is well webbed in the long pacing. Miles Morales's appealing storyline is intertwined with multiple other plots across the spider-verse. Gwen's character is a shining lamplight. All the other spideys from different worlds make a place to form the intriguing exploration of the multiverse. The spot is really an unique character choice to add on in the multiverse trajectory. Miles Morales's bond with his parents is an inspiration upon which the story finds a heart and soul. In here also, there is this fate of spiderman, that he or she has to make a sacrifice to withhold the power that flows in him. As every time, the stirring and insightful words from the mentors of spiderman thrives that matters in every storyline to serve the purpose that every superhero needs. The film often softens from its epic tone like a subtle colour to penetrate the bulky ambition and poignant emotions it carries. Probably the finest Spidey film to date. It ends with a cliffhanger, promising a beyond trek. Indeed, this film is a fabulous work of art that reminds us that there is no frontier to creation. It has just pulled us into its world of millions of our own-selves...","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","pedrocf14","12 June 2023","Just watched this amazing masterpiece and all i can say is WOW.I went into the cinema expecting a good movie but i never thought that i was about to watch the best Spider-Man movie EVER and probably the movie of the year! This sequel DESERVES nominations fellas!From the moment the movie starts until the very end you are HOOKED.The animation and character designs are absolutely amazing, all of the fight scenes are so well done and ""choreographed"", what a fantastic job by the animation team.The soundtrack is great and really fits into the movie and the characters like a glove.The pace is exquisite and really allows the characters to develop and show growth as the story progresses whilst we, the viewers, dont lose interest in it.An incredible amount of references are made in this movie to different Spider-Man Universes, such has Andrew Garfields, Tom Hollands and even the video game Spider Man gets a shout out! What a really fun way to acknowledge all the past Spider-Mans and to show that they really are all connected and to put Miles Morales Spider-Man next to all the other ones.The humor was actually surprising, because even though you are expecting to laugh when watching a Spider-Man movie, this sequel has really good timing on most of the jokes and one of the funniest characters of any Marvel franchise, in Spider Punk. Kudos to Daniel Kaluuya for giving us such a voice acting performance.This is, without a doubt, the best movie i have watched this year. It has emotions, growth and action, all we need in a super hero movie.It ends with a much expected cliff hanger for the next one and you best believe im going to watch it as soon as it comes out.9.5/10 - Absolutely Amazing.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","alex_with_a_P","14 January 2024","I found the first film to be a solid movie. A bit over-indulgent and over-praised but solid. This on the other hand, takes all the bad aspects of the first movie and cranks it up to eleven. First off, this doesn't feel like a story about Miles Morales. Sadly we are still doing the multi-verse gimmick that has worn off three years ago. To top it off the 150 minutes runtime is in no way justified for offering such a thin story. Most action scenes are far too long, especially the one with the Vulture and the mid-escape chase scene. That one in particular felt like a redo of the lab chase from the first film. A lot of times the movie was trying to recreate moments from the previous installement without the heart.And what's with the mediocre voice acting this time? Especially the opening monologue of Gwen Stacy felt like it was read from last-minute cue cards. To be fair, I liked the Gwen Stacy story arc in the beginning, but then they used an unbelievable character moment to make her force her hand to join the Spiderverse. And this is where the movie lost me. This whole world and the explanation of it's existence reeks of desperate attempts of an industry that is trying to sell the same doll with a different dress. I just don't watch superheroes to see them having existential crisis, it plagues the comic movies since The Dark Knight. They even implemented this narrative hook on characters like Superman (Man of Steel) who are the antithesis of this outlook and we saw how that went down.It's no coincidence that the story got very thin after we get to the Spiderverse. From then on the writers can only throw action set pieces after the audience to fill up the two and a half hours runtime (!). Seriously it was really boring, sometimes laughable (that shot of the hologram that reveals the serious face of Spiderman 2099) and the scenes that were supposed to make you laugh were tired. Especially the quips during the action were otherworldly bad. And once the dust settled, they filmmakers could not even manage to end it in a mildly satisfying conclusion. There are ways to end a story with certain degree of closure while some story strands aren't resolved. It's an art for a reason. But this is just plain lazy. What they dish out as a cliffhanger should have been the mid-turning-point of the movie. If they had any talented writers at all they would have made this movie with Miles and Gwen in their respectable world without crossing over into the other person's universe. Seemingly having a different story but with the same theme connecting them. That would of course require more work in the writing department to pull off, but you can tell that right after the success of the first movie they wanted to keep the machine running to churn out another one of these as fast as possible. And although four years seems like a long time for a movie, I can assure it's not for an animated movie. Especially one with this magnitude of animation quality, runtime and post production requirements. Unfortunately it didn't deliver, I was honestly rooting for this film but at least I don't regret anymore that I missed it in cinema.4 out of 10.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","ZeroMajor","1 June 2023","Never would have thought this movie would be 'MILES' better than its prequel, the countless amount of easter eggs for the Spider-fans, along with an engaging story that had its fun parts of action and meaningful interactions between well-thought out characters without losing the pace or intensity of the story. Across the Spider-Verse is a testament of immaculate craftsmanship from the passion and hard work done by the animators and writers of the prequel. The pacing is splendidly well-done, even the times where nothing major happens in the story is filled to the brim with fun interactions that breathe character to the people we all love in this story.

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Anurag-Shetty","13 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse continues with the adventures of Miles Morales(Shameik Moore), after the events of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018). Miles swings across the Multiverse, where he meets a huge team of Spider-People charged with safeguarding it. When all these various heroes disagree on how to handle a new sinister villain, Miles must dig deep & reinvent what it means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers & Justin K. Thompson have given us a movie that not only matches up to the masterpiece that is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018), but somehow manages to surpass it. The multiple Easter eggs referencing Spidey's appearances in various forms of media over the years, is absolutely delightful to witness. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. There are many scenes that will make you guffaw uncontrollably. There are many emotional scenes that will tug at your heartstrings & will make you tear up, too. All in all, the perfect ingredients that gives the viewers the best Spider-Man film of all time, even surpassing the superlative Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). The animation is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Kudos to the animators for continually pushing the envelope in the Spider-Verse franchise. The vocal performances are the highlight of the movie. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Hailee Steinfeld is outstanding as Gwen Stacy. Brian Tyree Henry is phenomenal as Jeff Morales. Luna Lauren Velez is amazing as Rio Morales. Jake Johnson is awesome as Peter B. Parker. Oscar Isaac is fantastic as Miguel O'Hara. Jason Schwartzman is brilliant as Spot. Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Karan Soni & Shea Whigham are excellent as Jessica Drew, Hobie Brown, Pavitr Prabhakar & George Stacy, respectively. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must watch for Spidey fans & pretty much everyone else. Watch it on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. Eagerly waiting with bated breath for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse(2024)!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","view_and_review","14 August 2023","Wow, I was so amazed by this movie I watched it twice in two days. I liked the first movie. I loved the sequel. I can't wait for part three.""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" picks up with Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) a couple of years older, in a new suit, and killin' the Spider-Man thing. Being Spider-Man has its drawbacks though. He's been missing school and his tardiness to different events has caused a strain between him and his parents, Jeff and Rio Morales (voiced by Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Velez).A rather innocuous battle with a villain named Spot (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) made Miles late to his father's retirement party which was the straw that broke the camel's back. His parents were fed up with Miles' behavior and his lame excuses.Before the movie jumped into Miles' story we got a glimpse of Gwen Stacy (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld) and what she was going through in her universe. She was having an even tougher time as her father, George (voiced by Shea Whigham), believed that she (as Spider-Woman) was responsible for the death of her best friend. She was saved from handcuffs by Miguel O'Hara (voiced by Oscar Isaac), the leader of an inter-universe Spider-beings legion that was responsible for preventing anomalies in the various universes. It was a big deal.Miles found himself at the HQ of the inter-universe Spider-Beings legion though he was uninvited. Things only got more dramatic from there.I was so deeply engaged in this movie I couldn't tell you if I was breathing or not. I'm sure I didn't blink. The movie got better and better as it went along. It was far deeper than I ever expected it to be and tons more entertaining. The storyline is perfection and some of the best writing I've ever seen from a comic book superhero movie.Some people have complained about the animation style. I say, ""Oh ye of little knowledge and appreciation."" The animation, which was a blend of various styles, was brilliant. Every style was a version of comic book illustration. Hobie (voiced by Daniel Kaluuya), who was Spider-Punk, wasn't even animated, he was a still illustration drawn in different poses and different positions and yet he was one of my favorites!I had zero complaints. Even the ending only made me pine for more. And Spot, that seemingly weak villain... yeah, even he got more awesome as the movie progressed. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is a welcome addition to the Spider-Man collection and it has supplanted many of the existing Spider-Man movies.","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","JaredLegend","31 May 2023","It was nothing short of spectacular and amazing. I didn't think they could surpass the animation of the first one, but this one clearly did. I was tearing up, not only because of how emotional it gets, but because of how beautiful the visuals are. I really liked that it was just good animation for the sake of good animation, because believe me, it was really good. But the good animation also served as somewhat of a way to differentiate between different universes. And by conditioning the viewers into thinking this, the twist is able to really shock them when it is revealed. Already can't wait for the next one!","10/10"

After spending almost two and a half hours building up a complex story and concern for its characters, this film provides no resolution to any of its plot elements, making the end of the film disappointing and frustrating.Miles Morales returns for the next chapter of the Oscar¬Æ-winning Spider-Verse saga, an epic adventure that will transport Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.","5/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","Aziz24","10 July 2023","Synopsis: He is now grown up, more mature, and lived with the Spider Man curse for a year. He seems like he is enjoying it, until it gets really dark. Miles Morals returns once again but this time, it's a more powerful enemy that forces Miles to revisit the past and discover the dark and unhidden secrets of the future. He is now in a different ""spot"".Spider Man Across the Spider-Verse created a whole new Spider man experience for every fan. That's with the help of the visuals, using a more unique animation vibe that sets you up with the mood of the film, more characters, and most importantly, the story that has a very deep meaning behind it.Comparing to the animation style used in the first part that sent animation films into another different level, this time the film discovers new and more advanced techniques to set up the perfect mode and tone for the story.The first film dived in Miles Morales' deep character development with the different changes that he went throughout the whole film. As he becomes Spider Man, we see how he goes through all of those changes and how he will adapt to them. As he discovered more about the harshness of being a superhero and the sacrifices he has to make. However, in this film, Miles' character development gets even more tough especially that it sets it up for the third part as well. Miles is not a kid anymore, and the sacrifices he had to make in the first part, are nothing in compare to the ones in the second part. Voice actor Shameik Moore has a huge part in making all of this possible. By just voicing the character, you can feel the anger, fright, or even the sadness and happiness of the character.Speaking of voice actors, Hailee Steinfeld proves herself again as a solid voice actor for Gwen Stacy. Especially that this film focuses more on that character on a deeper level and her relationship with her dad or with her past traumatic experiences. All of that can be seen in the great opening sequence of the film that is in my opinion, the best Spider Man opening sequences and can be considered to be one of the best opening sequences of a super hero film, of course after The Dark Knight's (2008) opening sequence. Daniel Pemberton's music and the animation colors with it's connection to Gwen Stacy and the many easter eggs that have a deeper meaning behind them.Composer Daniel Pemberton has a music piece titled ""Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)"" in the film that can be heard in the opening sequence specifically in which you can clearly tell that it is expressing Gwen's feelings. Especially that it came up in a scene that included a conversation with her dad in a room and the animation & colors on the walls of the room are inspired by water colors and they were dripping down like whenever the conversation between the daughter and the father gets tense or heated. Small details like this are the reason of making this film the greatest animation film SO FAR and the greatest film to tell a Spider Man story.My rating is 9.5/10Watched on June 2nd, 2023
Format: Digital IMAX.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","AntonioBollo","20 August 2023","This was a perfect movie to complement ""Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse"". I mean everything from the acting, animation, plot, twist/turns and much more was just astonishing. Complements to everyone but specifically Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld. They both do such an amazing job portraying there characters not inly in the first film but somehow manage to do even better on the second. I love the way both Shameik and Hailee along with the animators fill us in on the gap from the first movie to this one, between the transitions and colors.If you are a Spider-Man fan this is a very great film. The great thing about this movie is if you are a fan of Spider-Man you don't necessarily need to watch the first movie to have this one make sense.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","vallscar","1 June 2023","Story ended before I knew! It ended abruptly, absolutely in the middle when things were finally getting better. I really wish they'd cut down on useless scenes and add a good, substantial ending kind of like part 1. I was also expecting more of Pavitr and Punk, also there was literally no Noire which made me sad. I honestly feel sad after watching the movie, I was waiting for it to end by the time intermission ended. I watched it in 4d and I honestly don't know what to say, it was meh. I'm hoping for part 3 to be better and make up for it. Feel like my money is somewhat wasted, but the animation was great. Story was stirring up well, but again same point, they ended it too abruptly.","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","haloemile","5 June 2023","This is a spoiler free review: the animation and music in this movie were outstanding! If there was one movie to watch this year, it's this one. Usually movies that have a sequel aren't the good since the first one turns out to be better. But not this one, the the second movie topped its original with flying colors. Highly recommend to anyone even if they aren't a fan of Spider-Man or Marvel. It's a fun movie for anyone to enjoy! In all honesty, the movie had me calling out every cameo/easter egg I could find since it was filled with them. And I never do that for any movie. And if there is anything I could take away from this movie, it's, ""everyone's telling me how my story is supposed to go...nah, imma do my own thing.""","10/10"

"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","mrkmil","29 June 2023","Is the best movie of the decade an over exaggeration for this movie? To put it simply, no. Everything about this film is perfect.... well, other than the stupid cliff hanger ending. But i've learn to accept it overtime. Anyway the animation is spectacular. It has so many little details that you've 100% missed. The story is also amazing. The characters all have great writing and some with unique art styles like spider-punk having different art styles almost everytime we see him because he hates consistensy. Speaking of spider-punk he's definetly my fav character. I hope he gets more screen time in the 3rd installation, beyond the spider-verse. Anyways this movie is perfect and I really look foward for the final installation for this series.","10/10"

Somehow across the spider verse exceeds those.The great animation style that we witnessed in the first spider verse film, is expanded upon, with new characters and styles that adds to a film that sometimes feels and looks like art.The consstant shift between locations and different characters, creates a fun experience, that does not feel dragged out. Meanwhile Miles and Gwen work as exciting characters, while still having great chemistry between each other.This film is a masterpiece, and by far the best spider man film of all time, I would definitely recommend across the spider verse!","9/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","llambeth1","2 June 2023","I said it and I don't feel sorry about it! I'm not a comic book lover but I am a bit of a nerd. I really enjoyed the first movie and it's aesthetic. This movie is better! Better I tell you! The story is well done... the visuals are mesmerizing... the score just clicks with the visual and story like Lego. I wanted more! I craved more! I was angry then it ended, because it ended. This these movies define what a comic book movie should be like. It makes the MCU seem like a dumpster of hot garbage. So well done!! Easily one of the best movies of the last 5 years....

to watch it. After watching ITSV I keep asking myself ' Where Am I? 'After watching ITSV for 8 hours Now I'm ready for ATSV. When I walked out the cinema I was shocked. Ok Sony this one is PHENOMENAL! I ran out of words after watching it. It's completely an art on the big screen without any doubts. You can't look away from the screen for a second. This movie is in another level of animation now. Every frames are absolutely gorgeous and stunning. Every characters are full of heart. The story is beyond my expectations and I'm sure that yours too. Just three words for it ""I Love It""If you love spiderman(s), If you love Marvel, If you love animation, If you love Movies or If you are a guy spending your time at the cinema every weekend like me.GO WATCH IT!!","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","jacobmorel-21340","5 June 2023","When the first spider verse movie ended it was clear that Sony was going to make a sequel. I knew going into this movie the action and story were going to probably be better than the first. What I didn't know was that I was walking into one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. And that goes for both live action and animated films. From the moment it started to end I was hooked. The story was funny, dramatic, and enjoyable in a way that made me feel like the characters and story was actually real. And not just some mundane made up sci-fi story that's already been told a thousand times. By the end of the movie I was left wanting to see more, which for some movies is a bad thing, but for this movie I was only wanting more cause of how great everything I saw was. With the third movie coming out next year, I will be eagerly waiting for the story to continue.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","DanTheMan2150AD","3 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is a cataclysmic achievement not only in cinematic storytelling but comic book media in general. All my minor gripes about Into the Spider-Verse are absent and in its place captures the panel-to-panel thrill of reading your first ever Spider-Man comic. Smart, imaginary and completely unrestrained, Across the Spider-Verse might just be the very best Spidey movie ever made in what is an extravagant, very cool love letter to graphic design, executed with superb draftsmanship and giddy, infectious joy.It does lose half a star for the lack of The Emissary from Hell himself (also no 90s Christopher Daniel Barnes Spidey, but that's a personal peeve), although I bet good money he'll be in the next one.","10/10"
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse","krisssannn","5 June 2023","Only downside to this film is I have to wait until the next film to see what happens next. Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse checks every box. We see that Miles has grown in many ways but is still figuring out who he is. We learn more about Gwen and her background and how that connects her to Miles. I connected to their characters and related to their experiences. We also are introduced to new versions of Spiderman throughout the spider-verse and each character brings more delight.Overall the animation remains ahead of the game and is thrilling to see on the big screen. I love how the story built upon the foundation set by Into the Spider-verse without feeling boring. I honestly didn't want this film to end.","9/10"

I think back to the 1st film. Before the film started I asked myself HOW? HOW in the hell is SONY going to top the 1st entry to Miles. We know SONY has mishandled their Spidey IP in the live action department with a few given exceptions...So as I watched Gwen's story pulled LITERALLY from the comics to big screen & watched Spider-India, Spider-Punk with a twist,Scarlet Spider & the PLETHORA of Spidey characters in all its MAGNIFICENCE hit the screen. At the end of the film I answered my own question...THIS!..THIS IS HOW THEY DO IT! & I'll be damned, they SURELY did. The various art animation styles, the color palette usage, when they focused on each specific Spidey character at the time. The story arc being told & arcs they pulled from, with that creme de la creme twist myself & my son picked out once we saw Mile's mom face & knew immediately where they were going...perfection...left you begging for more. You could've told me to sit there for another 2 1/2 hrs & I would have not mind AT ALL. Knowing ahead of time this was always a 2 part film already had me excited, EVEN MORE after that ending. The group that was assembled towards the end my my my goodness. The gems of Easter eggs ontop of Easter eggs & other get you amped up surprises. At its core it had its drama & deep family story to tell, it had action, it had comedy it had suspense, it had it all, but 1st & foremost, the CORE concepts of what makes Spider-Man..Spider-Man, were showcased through & through. You can tell from the director, down to every single person/department involved with these 2 films well 3 üòèhopefully soon thoroughly love the character/characters.","10/10"

It just does not need any as the first installment set this sequel up to follow in some immensely successful footsteps.My only issue is that during one of the fight scenes, I could not follow what was happening because of the animation. But hey, it was still beautifully done! Everything else inclusive!The best storytelling by far as you have beautifully animated characters with lifelike emotional facial cues, deep and meaningful dialogue in every aspect of the story from very memorable characters and a near perfect musical score that plays to the beat of the oncreen action/drama.I also love that the multiverse is more than just the storyline for this movie. It includes the stories from all the Spider-Man iterations from over the years.The way each character old and new is re/introduced shows how much care went into this beautifully crafted movie.

"Gran Turismo","Sleepin_Dragon","9 August 2023","Gamer Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo supremo gets the chance to compete for a chance at the big time, a chance at The Nissan GT Academy, and subsequently a shot at winning a contract with Nissan racing.To say this is as far off my type of movie as possible is an understatement, I stood out at the cinema like a sore thumb, I didn't expect to enjoy it, but I have to say it, it's a very good movie.If you're expecting Fast and Furious, don't, sure it's full of speed and it's high octane, but it's more a triumph against the odds sort of story, with Jann the central character, a guy from Wales, taking on the elite at their own game, in what is an elite sport.Jann faces challenge after challenge, and just when you think he's succeeded, he's thrown another curve ball.Some very good use of special effects, the crash scenes in particular look amazingly realistic. There's also some wonderful location work too, they really did make use of several world-wide locations.Archie Madekwe does a great job as Jann, he puts in an excellent performance, you really do see the young man develop and grow through the film. Always good to see Bloom, and he played the part well, David Harbour was excellent I thought, he added a lot to the overall story.Is this the most random soundtrack ever, I never thought Kenny G, Black Sabbath and Enya would feature together in the same cinema, let alone the same movie.I never thought I'd welling up over a bluebird, but there you have it, there were one of two very touching scenes.Hard to imagine it's based on a true story, but credit where it's due, it translated into a fine movie.7/10.","7/10"

I had no clue this actual story happened, and as far as true-events films go, this is right up there with the best. It's a true underdog inspirational story that was cast perfectly, and filmed just as great, with stunning effects, visuals and camera work. The pacing and story-flow was just right, in that the 134 min runtime flew by quickly. Watching it in a 4DX theatre added to the experience for sure. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me. Now I just may have to go find that old GT game and throw it in and go for a spin.","8/10"

"Gran Turismo","andydavis-19959","30 September 2023","I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it, except that it was based on a video racing game. To be honest, I expected something more akin to the cheesy Fast and Furious movies. I had set a very low bar of anticipation.With that in mind, the reality of this movie was an enormously pleasant surprise: a fascinating true life story that magnificently captured the adrenaline buzz and accomplishments of elite motorsport.The racing scenes, and there's a lot of them, were masterfully created. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. It was an emotional rollercoaster; one minute I was grinning with euphoria, then gripping my hands in fear, then I was giggling out loud with a happy release of nervous energy.Being a true life story, it couldn't be spoiled by poor plot writing. I loved the uplifting, feel-good, tale of the talented underdog risking all to achieve his dreams. Yet it wasn't a clich√© because it was real; the movie had no sense of being formulaic or contrived.The acting was spot on, the characters perfectly well developed, and the special effects were both awe inspiring and seamless.The movie was enthralling from start to finish. It's absolutely a contender for being my favourite movie of the year. It's also one of my favourite motorsports movies of all time: and that's a compliment I don't give easily. How did this have so little buzz and anticipation before it was released?","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","FeastMode","25 July 2023","I watched Gran Turismo early as part of Regal's Mystery Movie Monday. For some perspective, I've never watched professional racing or played Gran Turismo. And I'm generally not a fan of based-on-true-story against-all-odds movies. They're usually all the same.The reason I say all this is to illustrate that the movie had to be really good to win me over. And it definitely does. Even though it goes through many of the same motions as these types of movies, it does it all so well. I was fully invested in the story, the characters and their outcomes. My crowd was really into it as well.I can't speak to how the movie translates the game, but they creatively incorporate some cool visuals. It helps it feel like a video game movie as opposed to a movie about a video game. The race scenes are awesome, you really feel like you're there. I like the cast, with the two leads being the obvious standouts. And there are some really heartfelt moments.I had a great time with Gran Turismo. It's definitely a movie you want to see on a premium screen (IMAX, Dolby Atmos, etc). I think most people will like it, gamer or not, race fan or not, old, young, etc.(1 viewing, early screening Mystery Movie Monday 7/24/2023)As a side note, I'm really hoping we've turned a corner with video game movies, similar to what happened to super hero movies in the early 2000's. I really enjoyed Sonic 1 and 2, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie is in contention for my favorite movie of the year.There is still so much potential. If they continue down the super hero path, then someone like Christopher Nolan will take a property and show what can truly be done. My dream would be for Metroid to be the Dark Knight trilogy of video game movies.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","ethanbresnett","7 August 2023","Gran Turismo is a terrifically executed sports movie, fizzing with energy and momentum from start to finish.It follows the story of Jann Mardenborough, a gamer who always dreamed of becoming a professional racer. Thanks to the Gran Turismo academy he suddenly finds himself with a chance to make his dream a reality. It's a wild story and the fact that it is based on real events is astounding.Even though the real events are unbelievable, the story beats are all pretty familiar and follow the usual sports movie formula. There's the underdog, the jaded mentor, the belligerent rival, the customary montage. None of this is ground breaking but it is all well presented and packaged up. The fact it is based on real events adds that bit of extra excitement and besides, who doesn't love an underdog story?The direction from Blomkamp is crisp and clean yet also energetic and chaotic, which makes for a visually engaging film. You really feel the excitement and thrill and danger of the racing, which was crucial to establish and get across, and was handled well.In terms of performances, Archie Madekwe is a really solid lead, bringing a strong emotional presence and charisma to his character. David Harbour brings his character to life perfectly with a thoroughly engaging performance, and Djimon Hounsou is a scene stealer with some of the more emotional baggage.I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did, but I was impressed! It has an unbelievable story to tell and it does it very effectively. A lot of it feels quite derivative of the underdog sports film genre, but the great direction and solid performances raise this film up above many of its peers, resulting in a thoroughly entertaining movie.","7/10"

The idea that you can make playing Gran Turismo so real that you would get recruited to drive an actual race car like it was your PlayStation is a Gamer's fantasy and it comes alive in a movie that's not a fantasy but a legit true story.Gran Turismo has got everything you need dramatically for a sports movie. The Trailers leading up to this film don't do it justice. It's got far more heart to it as it unfolds an amazing underdog story.Like the game it's based on it showcase every aspect of racing but now with a more personal touch.It's no Need for Speed but it's one of the best games adapted to a movie ever.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","burntoutboy","7 August 2023","Went into this not knowing the background of this film but came out pleasantly surprised with a great race car driving film but also a great video game film.If it weren't a true story, the concept would have been cool but definitely not believable and therefore no where near as good as it is.The racing and the direction taken to display the races was particularly impressive and at no point was it unclear what was going on. The acting was ok to begin with but got better as the film went on, especially with the emotional scenes. For me Harbour was the best actor in Gran turismo.The script was fine but did it's job well of portraying the stakes in high intensity scenes.Not really too much to fault as a true story racing film.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","taylormellors","7 August 2023","What an absolutely fun romp of a movie that was done a great disservice by its advertising campaigns. Unlike its very bad marketing would have you believe this is a great watch with an engaging story, anger inducing antagonists and some amazing acting performances, David Harbour is especially good as Jan's main guy. Orlando Bloom was also very good and Archie Madekwe should Sue the trailer house for displaying his performance as anything other than stellar. The movie has some problems of course, some of the CGI is abysmal and feels like it was a mix of bad CGI and wanting to make it look like a video game at all times, and the end result is really distracting. Also the movie loves to just abandon characters that could really go somewhere. Overall though, it's a great watch and I would highly recommend you ignore the trailers (that give away a weird amount of the plot) and go watch this film.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","arabnikita","18 August 2023","Gran Turismo (2023)Racing games are probably my least favorite because I get enough road rage in real life. However I do enjoy an occasional well made racing film like Ford vs Ferrari or Rush. Even though Gran Turismo is a highly popular video game, or racing simulator, this film is NOT a video game adaptation because quite frankly there isn't much to adapt. Instead, it's simply an underdog story that involves a video game and the impact that it had on real life events, kind of like what the film Tetris was. However, this one is quite an unreal story and the entire time I couldn't believe that these events actually occurred.The movie is about an expert Gran Turismo player named Jann. He is considered to be the failure of the family as all he does is play video games but one day, he receives an invitation to participate in an online race. The winner of the race will get chance to compete for a spot to become an actual racer for team Nissan. Sitting with a controller is quite different from being behind an actual wheel of a 300 km/h car and soon enough Jann and other competitors will realize what they signed up for.I know some people have been criticizing the start of the film but for me, it was one enjoyable experience that kept getting progressively better. Yes, it doesn't reinvent the sports drama genre but it takes on an intriguing true story and executes it well. The video game inserts looked good and the actual racing scenes very exciting to watch. David Harbour put on an impactful performance of an inspiring aged mentor who gradually passed down his wisdom to the young and inexperienced protagonist.From the negatives, the editing looked slightly weird at times but it didn't take away from the experience as the action and drama scenes hit home. The fast paced story kept me excited the entire time and I remember holding my breath more than once. Whether you enjoy good underdog stories, play racing games or like cars in general, you are going to have a good time in the cinema.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.","8/10"

We bought tickets to a 'surprise' pre-screening and didn't know what we'd be seeing.What a great surprise! A little something for everyone. Great acting, great cast with Orlando Bloom and David Harbour. Our daughter liked Josh's Stradowski even though he's the bad guy in the movie.Overall definitely worth watching, good production, good storyline. I like that it was based on a true story.

"Gran Turismo","malz-13196","3 November 2023","Remarkably predictable yet somehow still watchable. Unfortunately, it falls into the realm of complete unreality, characterised by a noticeable effort to impress that results in an odd casting choice. The production feels rushed, lacking the depth needed to engage viewers genuinely.While attempting to establish a connection with the characters, the film falls short in authenticity, at times bordering on the absurd. The narrative introduces a protagonist seemingly catapulted from a lifetime of bedroom isolation to sudden stardom and a near-death experience. Strangely, the parents, initially deeply invested in their child's life and future, inexplicably shift to mere onlookers via television, neglecting any personal visits until unrealistically late. A similar forced storyline unfolds with the girlfriend, contributing to the overall lack of sincerity.In performances by Bloom and Hounsou, one can't help but notice a decline in their usual high standards, and Halliwell might find more success in retirement.The film evokes a sense of those storyline videos often skipped in video games-perhaps a deliberate choice. However, despite its potential, it remains firmly in the category of a children's movie that could have been significantly improved with more thoughtful execution.","5/10"

"Gran Turismo","rannynm","2 August 2023","A scintillating, exhilarating watch, Gran Turismo will hold your attention from start to finish with its well-written script, deep characters, and detailed and immersive graphics.The film follows Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), a teen from Cardiff, Wales, who's obsessed with the video game Gran Turismo. Jann's family doesn't really understand his passion and worries about him, especially since he dropped out of university because of his dream to be a racecar driver. When Jann is selected as one of 10 kids worldwide to compete in Nissan's GT Academy for a shot to be a professional racer, he must face tragedies, love, deceit, and so much more on the path to glory.The cast shines in this film. Archie Madekwe as Jann Mardenborough captures the emotions of a teen with big dreams and the fire inside him to pursue them. He comes across as emotionless in the first few scenes but warms up into his character-by the climax, you're sure to be rooting for Mardenborough. My other favorite character is David Harbour as Jack Salter, a tough character to play. He's a typical Hollywood coach, aggressive but a bit jaded because of his previous experience in racing. Over the course of the film, he warms up, which is where Harbour shines; the transformation from a brooding middle-aged has-been to a kind but fiery coach is spellbinding. The screenplay by Jason Hall and Zach Baylin enhances the film massively, as do the cinematography and graphics, as well as the monumental score by Lorne Balfe and Andrew Kawczynski. In every racing scene, you feel like you're in the car with Jann; my jaw was clenched throughout every hairpin turn. When the lights go green at the beginning of every race, the whole theater vibrates with the sound of the engine starting up.Gran Turismo promotes resilience. Every time Jann fails, Jack Salter (David Harbour), his trainer, pushes him to overcome the failure, get up, dust himself off, and move on to the next race. Interestingly, Salter starts off in the film by not believing in Jann or any of the other kids in the GT Academy. Jann's performance turns Salter into his most ardent supporter. Herein lies another message: proving your detractors wrong. Salter's belief in always doing the right thing puts him at odds with Nissan marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), but is another great takeaway. And of course, the core of the film is about achieving your dreams, no matter how unattainable they seem; when fate, fortune, and prowess align, you will find success. Parents should be aware of scenes with slightly foul language, one kissing scene, and one scene where kids drink and hang out in an industrial area and then have to run from the police.I give Gran Turismo 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

"Gran Turismo","iamianiman","10 August 2023","Based on the incredible true story, the film follows the life of Jann Mardenborough who was an avid gamer before his dream turned into a reality by becoming a car racer. What this film offers is something that can inspire everyone; both adults and children and both fans and non-fans of car racing alike. It is moving enough for you to care about the characters, it is inspiring enough for you to realize that it is never too late to achieve your dreams. It is stimulating to the point that you would want to play the titular game right after watching the movie.While the story is far from getting that Oscar nod, this film knows that's not what they're going for. It's not about telling the story in a very detailed way, unfolding each event or emotion scrupulously. It's about serving what the fans want. Fans of Gran Turismo and other-related car racing games like Need For Speed & Forza Horizon. And they did that very well. The film did an excellent job of identifying their audience and giving them exactly what they want; a good mixture of story and racing. What's even better is other audience would also enjoy this one as much as die-hard fans of GT.Almost half of the film's runtime is set in the car racing track. That's a lot. Watching the film, we know that Neill Blomkamp, the director of District 9 and Chappie did his research and study on a lot of stuff. There's a certain mood that he brought here. That nervous feeling you had when you wanted to pass your driving license? You would feel it again here. Those dangerous racing stunts you saw at the Le Mans race? You would see it here. That Playstation-trademarked sound and those Gran Turismo-customized symbols you would hear and see when playing the game? They're present here. Neill made sure you'll have the best experience in the racing track.And yes, you could feel the intensity of the racing scenes. This film gives you that standard upward graph, the further the film goes, the higher the intensity is, and the more heart pumping you will be as the film comes nearer to the end. Even the racing gets tougher and tougher as it progresses with more dangerous race courses filled with twists, turns & dips. Adding onto that, Neill was able to put the audience at the edge of their seats with the powerful camera works. There are some very excellent drone shots here that might just give you the boost for adrenaline rush.But... one problem we had during the racing scenes was that we felt that the pacing could be better. They could have shown longer takes between the cuts. If they did this, the intensity could be even bigger. Why Ford V Ferrari is such a masterpiece was because of its pacing. It knew how to give the anxiety in the racing track. Don't get us wrong, Gran Turismo is still excellent but to up the ante, they could have made the pacing better with lesser cuts. Sometimes, we thought that the film was in a super rush mood, that they cut too frequently that one lap was over before you even know it.Archie Madekwe as Jann Mardenborough is great. For an up-and-coming actor having to take the lead role, he did a good job portraying Jann. Orlando Bloom as the marketing guy, Danny Moore also did good but David Harbour was the scene stealer here. He plays as Jack Salter, an engineer who helped to train Jann and his fellow competitors. David made his character lively and he made the story more vibrant and colourful with his personality. This trio did carry the movie and it actually made it more interesting.However, some pieces of the characters' story were left untold especially for Danny Moore. Yes, this film is more about GT and Jann, but they could have offered us more on his background story or maybe a bit more screen time to get to know his personality and motivation. We felt this film didn't achieve that. Orlando did good but the script for his character was lacking. Same goes for Jann's mom and dad. Their acting are just superb but they weren't given a chance to flesh out their characters and made the audience understand their behaviours or/and actions. Luckily, the story for Jann was well told.We're impressed by the visual effects of this film. WOW! Their CGI is soooo much better than most Hollywood films nowadays. Even recent Marvel movies couldn't top this. It wasn't perfect for one but it's a very eye-pleasing viewing experience when you get to see CGI that is just as good as this. While some CGI looks a bit animated, that actually made it better. Why? Because it's a game adaptation film and the CGI made it as if we're watching a gameplay. It has one of the best CGIs this year. *Chef's kiss*Verdict: An underdog film about an underdog person, Gran Turismo the Movie features slick car racing drama that serves exactly what fans want. It finds the right balance between telling an inspiring true story and adrenaline-filled racing sequences as the film progresses. While the loose storytelling and pacing can be distracting at times, it still manages to keep the audience engaged all the way until the finish line.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","eddie_baggins","15 August 2023","In 2009, up and coming director Neill Blomkamp won fans all over the globe with his release of District 9, a sci-fi debut for the ages that suggested we had just witnessed the arrival of a new generational talent.Fast forward to August 2023 and that very same director is back with his highest profile film in years, a glorified 2 hour plus Playstation commercial with a core cast that includes everyone's favourite Netflix sheriff/father figure and Ginger Spice.BASED ON A TRUE STORY! (In case the marketing teams message didn't quite come across in its incessant reminders to us all that this is not fantasy), Gran Turismo is one of the most inoffensive yet blandest blockbusters of the year as Blomkamp forgoes any of the creativity he showed with District 9 and his lesser sci-fi offerings Elysium and Chappie to put us in the fast lane with Archie Madekwe's Jann Mardenborough, a British gamer who left the comfort of his bedroom driving rig to enter into the very real (and very dangerous) world of organised racing.Following all the tropes in the book and delivering them in a way that makes one suspect the Playstation executives and producers of the film here may as well have sat on Blomkamp's directors chair through the whole process of this film coming to life, you almost wish that Gran Turismo was far worse in a notable way than it is here as the way in which its been bought to life makes it hard to hate with a passion, leaving it as one of those odd films that exists (for whatever reason that may be outside of hoping to sell a few extra PS5 consoles), only to be forgotten about before we've had time to contemplate its being.Reported to have a budget ranging in the $100 million dollar range, Blomkamps crowd-pleaser certainly has a shiny outer rig and it's the exact type of film that is sure to appeal to casual and less demanding of film-goers, racing fans and those that have spent hours on the tracks in the Gran Turismo franchise over the years but for anyone that likes to steer well clear of cliches, one note characters, talented cast members collecting an easy cheque or scripts that feel as though they went through more than a singular draft, Blomkamp's effort here isn't going to provide much value.With a hamstrung cast, that sadly sees the likes of David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou slumming it with roles they could play in their sleep and a hamming it up Orlando Bloom as Nissan marketing guru Danny Moore chewing scenery like its a tasty piece of candy, there was a chance that Gran Turismo's on track action could elevate the overall vibe of the feature or at least ramp up the thrills but compared to recent race-centric offerings like Ford v Ferrai or Rush, Blomkamp's film pales in comparison, unable to ever get its drama or its spectacle out of first gear.Final Say -There have been far worse video game adaptations in the history of cinema, a billion dollar effort earlier in 2023 a prime example, but there's no escaping from the fact that Gran Turismo is an instantly forgettable and entirely unimaginative crowd-pleaser that is destined to be forgotten long before the fumes have dissipated.2 Kenny G songs out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","4/10"
"Gran Turismo","ei-57187","25 July 2023","It's not a video game story. The fame is the platform for the real story. A young man wins an opportunity to become a real racer because of his prowess in the game. This is the tale of how he managed to attain his dream. David Harbour steals the movie from Orlando Bloom with his gruff, cynical view of the racing program and his grudgin change of heart. The racing sequences are spectacular and the effects superb. Don't go because you think it's all about a video game. Go because it's a story about a kid whose father is disappointed in him and his devotion to a game and his dream to be a real racer.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","daisukereds","28 September 2023","It's hard one to judge!But it is overall very enjoyable, tense and excellently produced and executed.Above anything, the races and camerawork are certainly the thing to watch it for. The human element reminded me of the people-plot on a Transformers movie.. it is intrinsically a part of it (and very necessary), but it is somewhat skippable, generic and dull. Buuut at the same time, both David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou made the movie for me and would not have enjoyed it without them.I also found it hard to keep in mind that this is something that actually happened 2011 (and should have been big enough for me to hear about it.. but it seems those kind of news don't reach my small country). On the one hand, that factual element makes this an impressive story to tell once you are done watching. But by that same effect, the movie FEELs too much on rails from the start and there are little surprises or memorable moments. Doesn't feel like they had to change or enhance much, as it is all very realistic and safe, and most drama is a checkbox that needed to be ticked. As you can see, I'm on the fence as to how much I liked it.I guess I'm glad I waited for streaming, instead of watching on theaters.","6/10"

"Gran Turismo","GusherPop","8 August 2023","Gran Turismo, directed by Neill Blomkamp, tells the true story of British gamer Jann Mardenborough, who transitioned from a real-life racing career to a big-screen role. The film stars Archie Madakwe as Mardenborough, who joins Team Nissan after winning a contest. Orlando Bloom portrays Nissan marketing executive Danny Moore, while David Harbour plays Jack Salter, a skepticism-driven trainer. Gran Turismo, released in 1997, is PlayStation's biggest-selling title and created by Kazunori Yamauchi. Its meticulous in-game recreations of famous race tracks and cars have helped gamers like Jann gain familiarity with circuits and vehicles in motorsports. However, Yamauchi's achievements are sidelined when Mardenboroug begins his training at the GT Academy. Blomkamp's movie, directed by Jan Blomkamp, films races as if they were video games, filling the screen with graphics that recall the gaming display. Mardenborough tries to prove himself in a arena where he is considered a joke and a liability. Rivalry within the academy arises as ambitious young hotheads vie for a single spot in the big league. In 2006, Nissan marketing executive Darren Cox created a competition and ""academy"" to turn gamers into race car drivers. The popular PlayStation racing simulator, Gran Turismo, was introduced in 1997. In the third year of the ""GT Academy,"" 19-year-old British kid Jann Mardenborough emerged as a star, becoming a professional driver. This inspirational underdog story, which brands like Nissan and PlayStation can partially credit and help underwrite, has gained popularity in the United States due to the Netflix series ""Drive to Survive."" ""Gran Turismo"" has taken this opportunity and made the clich√© version of movies like ""Barbie"" and ""Air,"" showcasing that ""brand"" movies can be fresh, vibrant, funny, and entertaining, even when focused on corporate schlubs. The movie, which has gone through several writers and directors, takes immense liberties with its true story and cherry picks elements from various points in Mardenborough's career to make his debut year as dramatic as possible. The film is credited to screenwriters Jason Hall and Zach Baylin and director Neill Blomkamp, who likes to amp up the excitement of a car going 200 miles an hour with cuts, close-ups, and aerial shots. The film's best invention is chief engineer Jack Salter, who is drafted by Nissan to train young racers and keep them safe. Despite being a cussed has-been, Harbour invests him with an ornery warmth, creating laughs and touching moments with Madekwe. The script reduces most other characters to ciphers, with Audrey (Maeve Courtier-Lilley) being the most egregious example. Mardenborough's parents, Steve (Djimon Hounsou) and Lesley (a sweet Geri Halliwell-Horner), may have had more to them in some drafts but are given short shrift in the edit.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","bentheimpaler","18 September 2023","In brief, this movie is competantly acted and creatively uses CGI to blurr the lines between the simulator and the film with a couple of amusing real-world sequences being shot to look like gameplay footage.But that is where the positives end.Despite some brilliant actors rounding out the cast, the dialogue all reads like a first draft of the script. There is no subtext, no nuance or real emotional depth to almost every line spoken.In most scenes the characters are essentially just announcing how they feel or what they think with little to no actual conflict brewing as they speak.This lack of human interest might be immaterial to the target audience if the racing alone was worth the price of admission, but most of the cinematography is just as overt and amateurish as the people we are meant to root for, with driving scenes being frankensteined together out of close-ups and rapidfire cuts.At no point is there any appreciation of geography on-screen, with the movie having to literally tack labels above the cars to tell you who is driving it, what their position is, and what lap the race is on. Resultantly, the climax of the movie is only slightly more visually stimulating than reading the wikipedia page on how that race went.I was shocked to see that this was allegedly directed by Neil Blomkamp. Though, given the hyperactive editing and some awkward post-production dubbing thrown in, I would be willing to believe that most faults are as a result of the studio either toying with his vision after the fact, or having hired him as the last-minute-stand-in for whoever actually directed most of the film.This movie is aggressively dull and predictable, and not worth the time to either enjoy it or mock it.Just read Jann Mardenborough's actual story online, and then play the game. This was a failure to capture the appeal of either.","5/10"

What a disappointment to see that with all these modern CGI technology available nowadays, Gran Turisma can NOT match many much older racing pictures in visceral exictiment.More bad: many below average acting performances. It doesnt really matter that the story has zero originality, zero suprises, but what does annoy is that this movies' actors are severely lacking in charisma and actor's chemistry.This movie is definitely targetted at a young (gamer) audience, but it doesnt even achieve the thrill of a real computer race game. So why watch it then?Not any good then? If you have enough popcorn and beverages for consumption ready to consume and there is nothing else playing at your local theatre, this might beat staring at your wallpaper at home, but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone, not even the young gamer crowd.","4/10"

The entire story is laid out in front of you like a familiar race course.**But go see it on the big screen**The story is quick, goes fast, navigates the cliches and is filmed beautifully. The temptation to overlay ""game play"" looking visuals is not overdone, and the in-car visuals are stunning (it is why you want to see this on the big screen). The actual person was the stunt double for his part.Much like in theater Rocky ~ our audience was into it fully, cheering at the right spots.

But the Movie is the opposit.So what is unrealistic? These are no crash races, and the driver from Capa rams other cars, like he drives bumper cars. In no racing league he would get away with this.The car driving physics are also not realistic.And what was it about the 24 hours of le mans? Why are they starting in the middle of the lap? Where is the end lap after the 24 hours? What is going on here?And that brings me to the characters. Why nobody has a deep Background Story? Every guy or girl that is in the movie has no story, except the main character. And this makes it boring as hell.Even the main character is not very likeable, typical stereotype you don¬¥t care of.The movie lacks in deep character development, knowledge of cars and racing and how to build tension. Wow almost every race ""Photo Finish!"". This makes no tension, this makes headaches.Sorry to say that, but the makers of this flick has no clue about what they had to do. If they had, they would not do so much dumb mistakes. Ramming other Cars and so.So yeah, another garbage game to video adoption.","3/10"

"Gran Turismo","SAMTHEBESTEST","25 August 2023","Gran Turismo (2023) :
Movie Review:A Marathon Race Film For Video Game LoversNeill Blomkamp's biographical sports drama, ""Gran Turismo,"" stars Archie Madekwe, David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, Darren Barnet, Emelia Hartford, Geri Halliwell Horner, and Djimon Hounsou. Based on the life of Jann Mardenborough, the film promises to be a fact-based story but has taken enough fictional liberty for its cinematic appeal. The idea of a racing gamer becoming a professional race car driver is fascinating enough to pique anybody's interest, but making a film is not anybody's business. We have been through ""Ford vs. Ferrari"" and ""Rush""-two of the most popular films of recent or arguably all-time-to understand almost all the classy techniques of the mainstream entertainer. Gran Turismo doesn't try to be like them, which actually works in its favour. But at the same time, it causes a low-grade cinematic experience because the film never looks like a big-screen spectacle. FvF has some extraordinary racing sequences that make you feel all the thrill, but GT is more like a gaming experience without far from the graphic appeal of cinematic spectacle. Also, racing films should be about speed, and this film doesn't have it in the first half. The second half covers the loss, but it's too far behind in laps by then. Despite these major flaws, Gran Tourismo wins the race with its inspiring and motivational storyline.The film kicks off with Danny (Orlando Bloom), a marketing expert and creator of the SIM video game, giving a presentation speech about how he wants to make the video game lovers professional race car drivers. Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) loves SIM video games and is eager to make a career as a race car driver. He is randomly chosen to participate in a race that qualifies him for the professional training of race car drivers. Jack Salter (David Harbour) is Jann's trainer and sees great potential in him. During a big race, Jann has an accident and wants to quit racing. Jack encourages him to make a comeback as he believes Jann can be the best in the world, and there begins the inspirational journey of Jann Mardenborough. The rest of the film is packed with races, including the 24 Hours of ""Le Mans.""Gran Tourismo could have been crisper than what it is since this theme is very exciting. Racing is a breathtaking thing and deserves to be presented in such a manner that viewers can enjoy the superfast ride without any disturbance. GT's screenplay drags too much in the first hour, letting your eyes go sleepy and your body go yawning halfway through. Some action begins in the second half, and you are into the film again. Some of the racing sequences are portrayed with gaming effects, trajectory paths, and all, just to give you a better viewing experience. It looks good sometimes, but not all the time. The storyline of Gran Turismo is like fan service. If you love racing simulation gaming, then you are going to have a good time. That's what the problem is, I guess. More than a racing film, it's fan service. That's why it isn't as great as Ford vs. Ferrari.We have seen Jann Mardenborough many times, and believe me, Archie Madekwe has no similarities at all to portray him on screen. From the first scene, it's a negative bell. He has performed well, though. It's just that his appearance and personality don't match Mardenborough's. Orlando Bloom walks away with ordinary scenes and ordinary acting. The role had something in it, but it didn't spark enough. David Harbour reminded me of Matt Damon from FvF, and believe me, it's no easy task to match Damon. You just can't match Damon at his peak. Harbour doesn't either, but he leaves a strong mark of his own, even though the character remains underwhelming. Jann's parents, Djimon Hounsou and Geri Halliwell, were decent, while his chemistry with Maeve Courtier-Lilley just didn't work. The love story didn't fit anywhere in the narrative, yet it took almost 15 minutes of your watch time. The support of Darren Barnet, Josha Stradowsk, and others could be termed okay, as all they had to do was fill the screen without glitches.Gran Turismo has many racing scenes, but does even one stay in your memory? Hardly so. There was scope. Unfortunately, it's overlooked. Jacques Jouffret's camera gives you some pacy frames, but I don't understand why they had to give those half-cut pauses in the middle of the racy sequence. For flags and numbers, seriously? A few scenes have the racing track transformed into SIM gaming and vice versa; I think you'll enjoy that. Talking about the editing, GT seriously needed to be trimmed by at least half an hour. Neill Blomkamp's direction lacks novelty factors as the storytelling is too basic for 2023's standards. He kept fans in mind and forgot others, but thankfully, it's a critic-proof film since Mardenborough is a popular name and the gaming fraternity is too large. They will have something to cherish here, for sure. I just wish Neill had kept the whole film in top gear instead of just the last half hour, and it would have been a rush-filled race.RATING - 5/10*","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","martinrobertson300482","29 August 2023","Gran turismo looked like a movie with a decent story, but turned out its way better than i could have ever expected. Its a feel good, inspiring movie full of car racing action and some genuine heart.Its not only way better than i thought it would be, but also less predictable than it looked. It'll be better going in not knowing anything about the story its based on. As there is extra tension to all the racing in the movie if you don't know where it's going. I was more drawn in by it being based on true events as i don't know anything about the game. But the movies more well made than a ""video game"" movie really deserves either way. As i found myself really rooting for the characters. Plus it has an ace soundtrack and David Harbour was great as the tough but troubled trainer.I almost gave the film full marks but after reading about some of the controversy surrounding it i cant give it a perfect score. As i guess some of the effects are a bit distracting too. All i can say is its really more entertaining than i expected.","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","gravloc","6 August 2023","I really liked it! It had what every movie needs; action, romance, drama and laughs. Proves that Neill Blomkamp can make different kinds of movies. District 9 is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best debuts by a director ever. Elysium was good, and I even liked Chappie. Then he sort of fell off the map and came back with a pretty crappy horror movie that I can't even remember the name of, after making some pretty cool shorts. This movie proves that he's still got it, and can do different genres also. Anyway, this was a really good movie! The rest of this is filler.....................","9/10"

"Gran Turismo","Anurag-Shetty","28 August 2023","Gran Turismo is a biopic about Jann Mardenborough(Archie Madekwe). Jann is one of the best players of the Gran Turismo video game & also dreams of becoming a real race car driver, someday. A motorsport executive named Danny Moore(Orlando Bloom) gives him this chance & Jann gets the help of former race car driver Jack Salter(David Harbour), to help him achieve his lifelong goal.Gran Turismo is an awe-inspiring film. Director Neill Blomkamp has gone past his sci-fi roots & given us a movie that is an absolute treat for fans of racing films & inspirational biopics. The racing set pieces are mind-blowing & are further enhanced in IMAX. David Harbour is phenomenal as Jack Salter. Orlando Bloom is brilliant as Danny Moore. Archie Madekwe is spectacular as Jann Mardenborough. This is Madekwe's breakout role & he will have a long & varied acting career. Darren Barnet is awesome as Matty Davis. Djimon Hounsou & Gerri Horner are brilliant as Steve Mardenborough & Lesley Mardenborough, respectively. Josha Stradowski is perfect as Nicholas Capa. The supporting cast is impressive. Gran Turismo is a must watch for racing movie aficionados. Watch it on the biggest screen possible & have a whale of a time!","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","MickyG333","17 December 2023","8.2 stars.I would most certainly watch 'Gran Turismo' several times, and probably will see it again in the next year or two. This is one of those dark horse films, you think it's going to be pretty good, but you are shocked by how good it really is. This is a riveting story full of intense feelings of anticipation and excitement. We are rooting for this kid who plays a video game. It doesn't get more strange. I would say this has a 'Top Gun' meets 'Ender's Game' feeling. They definitely take a few lines from 'Top Gun', and the whole premise is an 'Ender's Game' - teach the gamer how to fight real battles vs real enemies theme.I love this movie for three reasons: it's very entertaining, the characters are very likable, the story is developed and smooth. I was on the edge of my seat for the second half, lots of adrenaline to be burned.","8/10"

For the movie not to have any clips filmed in Cardiff seemed odd. For there not to be any Welsh accents (perhaps a hint from the 1!

"Gran Turismo","Rod_ccsqlp","28 September 2023","In the realm of cinema, the racing genre has a history filled with thrilling spectacles, heart-pounding action, and memorable characters. Unfortunately, ""Gran piece of caca"" manages to fall short on all fronts, delivering a mind-numbing mass of clich√©s and failing to propose anything remotely innovative. It's a regrettable waste of time, on top of terribly acting.The screenplay seems to have been assembled from a checklist of racing movie tropes. You've got the obligatory training montage. It's as if the filmmakers were content to recycle scenes from past racing movies instead of crafting something unique.The action sequences, while plentiful, lack any real sense of tension or excitement.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is its failure to provide any fresh perspective on the racing world. Racing has a rich history and a passionate fan base, yet the film barely scratches the surface of what makes this sport intriguing. There's no exploration of the dedication and sacrifice required to excel in racing, no insight into the technical intricacies of the sport, and no examination of the camaraderie among racers. Instead, it settles for tired clich√©s and surface-level drama.The performances by the cast are uninspired at best. The lead actor lacks charisma, delivering lines with all the enthusiasm of a damp towel. The mentor character, played by an aging action star of yesteryears, is a caricature of the wise old sage, spouting clich√©d life lessons with a straight face. Even the love interest, who should inject some emotional depth into the story, feels like an afterthought, given little to do beyond smiling and offering occasional words of encouragement.The cinematography, while technically competent, fails to capture the exhilaration of racing. The camera work lacks innovation and fails to convey the sense of speed and danger that is essential to the genre. It's as though the filmmakers relied solely on CGI to create excitement, neglecting the visual storytelling that can make racing films so compelling.In conclusion, ""Racing Redux"" is a soulless attempt to cash in on the racing movie craze without bringing anything new to the table. It's a formulaic mishmash of clich√©s that fails to engage or entertain. For those seeking a truly adrenaline-pumping racing experience, it's best to revisit classics like ""Days of Thunder"" or ""Rush"" and leave ""Racing Redux"" in the dust. This movie is a forgettable pit stop on the road of cinematic history, and one that should be avoided at all costs.","1/10"

I have to admit that both people I watched this with at the cinema enjoyed the film. I unfortuntely didn't for seveal reasons. Yes the cars were great and the acting was okay but the script and direction were a big disappointment. There was overuse of cliches and exposition (oh let's just make sure the viewers understand what we mean by a 24 hour race - it takes place during the day and night...)
It missed so much of what makes racing really interesting for me as a petrolhead - the build up to a race, the comparison of the cars, the qualifying, the mechanical mishaps etc. Not even the crashes properly explored pain and suffering. It tried to cover too many elements of the story and failed to properly engage me in any of them.","10/10"

Especially Archie Madekwe, I genuinely don't think this guy can act, period. After seeing his disaster performance in ""See"" I wasn't expecting much but damn, this was a whole new low bar.Long story short it seems to me this was a joint venture marketing campaign by Sony and Nissan splashing around cash on some established name actors, some cool CGI if I'm honest but that's about it.

Editing is incredibly well done, on point, and helps build the pace of this sports movie that seems more like a family drama.The writing is sloppy and direction is below average. If anyone watching this movie thinks it's great then they have no idea what a great sports movie looks like.

"Gran Turismo","CapStar362","18 December 2023","I have played Gran Turismo myself since its introduction back on Play Station, up till GT6. Despite the few anachronisms, this is a pretty decent film. The biggest glaring issue is that Jann's accident that resulted in the death of a spectator at Nurburing Nordschleife was actually after his 3rd place win at the Le Mans 24 Hour Circuit De La Sarthe, occurred before the race here in the movie. A few other inaccuracies but overall the Movie was pretty decent. Seeing development of Gran Turismo included and portrayal of Polyphony's development team and the aspects that make Gran Turismo one of the top Racing Sim's in the gaming industry added the enjoyment.I knocked a star on the CGI stuff, the inclusion of video game elements into the real life racing blurred reality just a bit too much and the out of continuity of which version of GT Jann actually played and the GT Event itself having much much newer titles than the ones originally played soured my opinion just a tad. With Polyphony and Sony backing this product, I think it would be very easily obtained to have portrayed Jann in his original environment of the much older titles with accurate hardware and the story line to match.Overall though, its entertaining. I'll certainly be going back over this for user submissions later on.","3/10"

If it is based on true story, why not stick to the true story? Prototype cars passing GT cars in Le Mans is because prototype are so much faster and happens all the time. Not because Mardenborough is the best racer.Jann Mardenborough was not a great racer. He only has one victory out of 40 Super GT races. His overall career is mediocre at best. And the movie trying to portray him as a great one backfires. At the end, he finishes 3rd but celebrates like he won.

"Gran Turismo","matris1","7 January 2024","The good: The acting and characters are likeable. The film clips along at a nice pace with a staple (but endearing) underdog story. The racing/action segments are entertaining with some cool game graphic/effects thrown in to mix it up. I also appreciated the homage to the game itself and its creators (being a gamer myself). The (post film) connection to the real Jann and his story is the final cherry on top for how this movie respects the source material. Nice one GT.The bad: Not enough time is spent on backstories and developing character motives. Whilst this would drag out the runtime (meaning something else would need to be sacrificed to keep the pace), a lot of the characters (especially minor ones) end up being 2D caricatures instead of well rounded, interesting sources of conflict or competition for the protagonist. The only thing that really tests the main character is completely unrelated to anyone else in the film. Fortunately, this was my only gripe.Summary: I'm feeling more and more confident that the video game movie curse is finally lifting. Gran Turismo is an entertaining, high-quality racing/underdog movie that earns its audience rating, respects its source material and most certainly deserves an audience. Recommended.","4/10"
"Gran Turismo","jboothmillard","17 August 2023","I played at least one of the Gran Turismo video games when we had a PlayStation2 console, the racing simulation series started in 1997 and has spawned many sequels and spin-off games, this film is a combination of an adaptation of the games and a true story that spawned from someone playing it, directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie). Basically, in 2011, Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) is an ordinary nineteen-year-old British working-class teenager who is an avid gamer, constantly playing the various Gran Turismo games on his PlayStation console. His father Steve (Djimon Hounsou), a former professional footballer, is concerned about his obsession with the game and suggests he should think about finding a serious career. At Nissan, motorsport marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) has the idea to take a generation of high-scoring young ""sim racers"" and take their talents driving the simulation racecourses and putting them behind the wheel of real race cars. Many motorsport trainers turn down his pitch, until he talks to former race driver Jack Salter (David Harbour), who missed the opportunity to become a champion racer. Salter is initially unconvinced that they can create real racers out of unprofessional gamers, but Moore sells it as a great marketing opportunity. Soon, at various gaming venues around Britain and across the world, advertisements are placed on Gran Turismo gaming machines and the online platform for a competition. 100,000 entrants will play the game, and the highest-scoring players of the tournament will join the GT Academy. Jann hears about this opportunity and makes it just in time to a venue to participate, he is successful and heads to Nissan for training. Jann meets several players from around the world who were successful, with varying abilities and attitudes, including American rival Matty Davis (Darren Barnet). The recruits are warned that they will experience G-forces higher than an astronaut experiences on take-off. The training process slowly whittles the selected candidates down one by one, as their gaming abilities cannot contend with the realities of racing. Jann is highly successful during the process, passing many simulations, driving tests and exercise regimes with high scores and good results, but Moore is concerned by his lack of response and personality when it comes to press interviews. He and the other gamers also get the opportunity to meet Kazunori Yamauchi (Takehiro Hira), the creator of Gran Turismo. It comes to the point when Jann and the others need to pass a test to get their official licences to race, and he must be within the top four to qualify, he succeeds coming in fourth place in this race. When it finally comes to a race to decide who will go ahead to compete in real racing against professionals, Moore is unconvinced by Jann's televisual presence, but Salter reminds him that the numbers are what count, and they agree for him to go ahead. Jann enters his first official race, with Jann on the radio mentoring him. As he continues to race professionally, Jann slowly climbs up the rankings, eventually reaching the top ten. Jann has a routine before every race to relieve his stress and keep himself calm, by listening to ""Songbird"" by Kenny G and ""Orinoco Flow"" by Enya. The press is understandably sniffy about his progress, but his upward progress eventually gains positive feedback and attention, and Jann does gain some more confidence being on television. During his races, Jann imagines himself being in his bedroom racing the courses he recognises in the games, and uses his previous abilities to control his cornering, passes and speed. During one race, there is a serious crash and fire; Jann is taken to hospital, his father and mother Lesley (Geri Halliwell Horner) are terrified by the lack of information about his condition. He survives the crash with only minor injuries, he is shaken but he assures all concerned that this will not put him off driving. The big opportunity comes to prove himself when Jann is chosen to compete for Nissan at the Dubai 24 Hour. This 24-hour race sees him and two of his fellow drivers competing at Le Mans, the most challenging racecourse in the world, taking shifts over the various hours, and if he is successful, he and his team will ultimately prove the doubters that gamers can become champion racers. In the final lap, Jann finished third in his class, which was enough of a launching pad for a full-time profession as a motorsports driver. It ends with Jann, Moore, Salter, and the others celebrating his success with their great placement in the race. In real life, Jann Mardenborough went on to win many championship races. Also starring Josha Stradowski as Nicholas Capa, Daniel Puig as Coby Mardenborough, Jann's brother, Maeve Courtier-Lilley as Audrey, Jann's love interest, Thomas Kretschmann as Patrice Capa, Richard Cambridge as Felix, and Emelia Hartford as Leah Vega. Madekwe gives a good lead performance as the young gamer turned racing car driver, Harbour steals many scenes as the grouchy but helpful trainer, Bloom is interesting as the sleazy wheeler-dealer type, Hounsou is fine in support, while ""Ginger Spice"" Halliwell is odd casting and is completely wooden (as much if not more so than Spice World: The Movie). The real story of an outsider kid from Cardiff joining the elite world of motorsport is interesting, and the racing sequences, cleverly intertwined in moments with the game graphics, are exciting, it is just let down a little by the predictable script with predictable dialogue, as an overall film, it's not a bad biographical sports drama. Okay!","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","herrimancoder","26 December 2023","This is a fun movie that was well done. Absolutely incredible that a video gamer became one of the best race car drivers in the world. The movie doesn't try to get dark or weird or too philosophical. It just tells the story in a fun and fast-paced way.The directing and cinematography were both good. The acting and dialogue was good. I don't think this movie will win any Oscars but it was a fun show that was super entertaining all the way through.Watching Hopper from stranger things and legolas from Lord of the rings was also fun having those guys in this movie. I wish more movies like this were made.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","ThereelscoopwithKK","28 August 2023","First off I will mention the worst thing about the movie which is its marketing as the actual film itself is simply spectacular. The trailer and all the ads I've seen make it look like just another video game movie. My fellow movie going attendee and I based on its marketing had it pegged as what we would call an undercard , essentially a movie where the popcorn is the hero of the night. So much so that if it weren't for National Cinema Day and the cheap admission we might not have even attended.The movie is so much more than advertised. From start to finish it was an absolute rush of adrenaline , but with the inclusion of a beautifully organized and defined inspirational story. The casting is absolute perfection. The David Harbour Schtick works wonderfully in his role as Jack Salter. He brings his grumpy tone but also shows some range in connecting with Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe). Orlando Bloom plays a different role than his usual and executed it well. Archie Madekwe also provides what is needed in the lead role by consistently maintaining a humble demeanor and avoids overacting, which can be a real pitfall of sports movies.The best quality of the film is its pacing. It never gets stuck on any scenes, but nor does it rush through any. The 2 hour 15 min runtime feels neither too long nor too short.The race scenes had the theatre on the edge of their seats with people outwardly expressing joy and fear. With how many races there are included you'd expect to tire out a bit but each is unique and adds to the story. As a sports fan, but not someone who knows anything about car racing or Gran Turismo I feared I wouldn't really know what was going on in the race scenes or they would be simply boring. The way they execute these scenes is simply beautiful and definitely made for everyone.Usually I am a pretty tough critic of sports movies. It takes special work to avoid being sappy and corny, but this delivers a wonderful message of perseverance while never being over dramatic.Quality inspirational sports movies are so few and far between that not many are even made anymore. I strongly recommend this movie. Definitely one of my favourites of the year.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","Drawmort","30 January 2024","Gran Turismo enters the select and small group of 2023 films for which there were not high expectations, but which pleasantly surprised. With an electrifying interface, perhaps even superior to the same video game it is adapting, the film entertains and delivers several emotions that are easy to assimilate as part of the plot. The story is easy to understand and generally quite round, leaving no loose ends at the end of the more than two hours of duration, which fly by.You can find exciting first-person sequences inviting you to experience more intensely, exciting photographic sequences and immersive and effective direction work. The performances are pretty decent, although no one shines too much.It's definitely a movie to enjoy, whether you are part of the Gran Turismo gamer family or a mere movie buff looking for an action thriller with cars and video games.","6/10"
"Gran Turismo","mrglenngrant","14 August 2023","Went to see this at Linwood with Granty-Boy and we both had pretty big reservations about it - it could be really good but it could equally be really really bad. In the end we were both pretty happy with it.The story itself is ridiculous ... in the sense that if it wasn't based on a true story you'd immediately shout about how stupid and unbelievable it is. Ain't life funny sometimes!?The driving sequences were good and - at times - genuinely nerve-wracking.David Harbour was really good ... and Geri Spice was not all that bad. Crazy to see her not wearing white. :-))Unfortunately, if you're a fan of racing you can see the glaring holes in the story ... like no practice, no qualifying, how many clutch gear-changes were shown when these haven't been used in race cars for decades!?Other things that annoyed me :In the last Academy race ... of course he was starting in last place and had to overtake every other car to win. Why?!?In his first race for his licence he was running in 4th and then got creamed from behind and didn't finish. Why was he apologising like it was his fault?63/100.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","staunton-gary","28 September 2023","Glad that I took the time to watch this movie. I thought that it was going to be the usual game-to-big screen fanfare, but I had a bit of time free. I wasn't expecting it to run for 2 hours and 14 minutes though. A tad long, but entertaining nonetheless.Archie Madekwe (Jann Mardenborough) was perfect in this role, albeit about 6'3"", much taller than Jann Mardenborough. David Harbour (Jack Salter) performed well, Orlando Bloom (Danny Moore) was a typical over the top marketing person. It all worked.Some great effects and a banging soundtrack accompanies this movie. I would recommend this.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","AfricanBro","15 August 2023","I had somewhat low expectations so the movie managed to surprise me. A lot of the action sequences in the first half were disappointingly brief. The entirety of the first act and parts of the second seemed somewhat disorganized, transitioning quickly from scene to scene, giving the impression that they were rushing through story elements, almost as if they were trying to quickly check off various plot points to hurry towards the uplifting part of the narrative.David Harbour delivered a strong performance, with the interactions between him and Jann standing out more than the racing scenes for me. His performance was important to the movie's success. Although David's acting was good throughout, Jann was his best when they were sharing the screen. Their remarkable chemistry was the heart of the film. The movie does take a while to establish its rhythm and pacing but once it finds its footing, it becomes quite enjoyable, even evoking emotions at times. As the story unfolds, Jann transforms into a driver worth rooting for so by the end, people were standing and cheering at the end of the movie.IMO, the 4DX doesn't contribute much to the movie. While it does make it a little more fun, it doesn't substantially elevate the overall experience. It's weird that the film was exclusively early premiered in this format. Also why is it ""early released"" several times, I didn't even notice its official premiere is later on the 25th.The racing was a mixed bag, at times absorbing you in how intense it was but often it felt like some races ended too abruptly. Ofcourse, it's impossible to show an entire race within a movie's scope, yet for the pivotal races, the execution was still good. Once the movie finds its heart and essence, youre drawn in more, not just the thrill of the action but also the emotional resonance. As for the CGI, I get the intention behind giving it a gaming vibe, but I'm still a little unsure about it.Josha Stradowski's performance was decent enough, seemingly tailor-made for the role of an egotistic douchebag. Apart from David Harbour, much of the cast seemed to be underused, particularly Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. Djimon, a good actor, could have been better utilized if the father character had been more effectively written, allowing for a deeper dive of the family dynamic. The film touches on a few things but only scratches the surface; like the beef with the rich guys portrayed as the story's antagonists, although I'm not convinced the movie truly needed an outright villain. This could have freed up more time to concentrate on aspects like the father-son relationship, which had a pivotal lovely moment that didn't have the desired impact due to insufficient emotional buildup.The film is an enjoyable heartwarming, based on a true story underdog sports movie. I can't speak for the gamers, but as a motorsports fan, I had doubts and it exceeded my expectations, leaving me with a renewed sense of optimism for the Brad Pitt F1 movie currently in the works. Because F1 really really really loves that guy soo much, like they need to chill tf out lol. Him and Tom Cruise.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","stevelivesey-37183","25 October 2023","I was not expecting anything from this at all.It follows the formula of most films of this type and as such never really gives us any surprises.Neil Blomkamp, who has directed far better movies that this including the brilliant District 9, directs here trying to get blood out of a stone and pretty much achieves it with having little to work with in terms of script and mediocre acting talent.I liked the CGI being linked to the original video games and with staying largely true to the real story..
I normally don't look forward to films based on computer games but at least this was tried it's best.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","RebelPanda","31 August 2023","Neill Blomkamp's Gran Turismo is a fusion of real-life racing and gaming, showcasing Jann Mardenborough's journey from gamer to professional racer. The film's unusual but fitting tone combines exhortations and motivational phrases with sweet romance and humor, all set against the backdrop of high-speed racing action.While the racing sequences impress and Archie Madekwe's portrayal of Jann shines, the film falls into sports movie clich√©s and lacks depth in character development. It skims the surface of corporate aspects in motorsports, emphasizing visuals over substance. Gran Turismo offers thrills for fans of the game but doesn't break free from formulaic storytelling, settling as a competent but forgettable entry in the motorsports cinema genre.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","johnspringer-95440","29 December 2023","Why does Hollywood insist on making a version of the ""sporting underdog defies the odds and achieves a personal victory"" movie at least once a year? Because when it's done right it works. Gran Turismo is very much on brand for that sort of formulaic, feel-good story. It's done right, and it works. There's nothing particularly novel here, although a trio of excellent performances exceed typical genre conventions. What could've just been a 2-hour Playstation/Nissan commercial touches on some pathos without getting bogged down in it. This doesn't have the nuance or high personal stakes of Rocky or the best of its thousands of imitators. But it's still fun and uplifting with some pretty cool racing scenes.","3/10"
"Gran Turismo","ivobg","13 November 2023","Poor execution. IMO, of course.I'm one of those Gran Turismo (since PS1) fans who loved to drive hours and hours and I knew every single circuit with it's dangerous parts. The hours spend trying to get all licenses, and then trying to improve the times.GT was a real magic and It's cool to hear a story about some kid who did all of this in reality!But honestly - as a ""movie critic"", I wasn't impressed by this production. The acting was mediocre. None of them was convincing, it looked like an amateur movie production. There was some scenes that make no sense and was unneeded in the story.The music was also weak.I couldn't feel any tension during the races actually. Despite I didn't know the story line, everything seemed so predictable.Overall, I didn't enjoyed this movie as I was enjoying playing the game.

Looking at the reviews on here, Sony must've shared thousands of premier tickets with people to make them write something positive about the movie. The production quality is stellar, but that's all. It's too long, it has no character development, it's illogical all the time. The passing in the races is ludicrous, as if the opponents drive Daihatsu Cuore's while the protagonist miraculously finds the gas pedal and pulls away. I can't believe Polyphony and Sony made this to be honest. They make quality most of the time. I'm baffled and want 140 minutes of my life back.","8/10"

I've played GT1 through 4 religiously, So I was really looking forward to watch this.The Gran Turismo movie does not disappoint. It has Great acting, great visuals and actions. David Harbour and Orlando Bloom are great as always and other actors are as good. I would expect to see fake cars or fake courses in these kind of movies, which fortunately this one did not have those.The movie does a complete shift from video games to actual races and does not go back to games. It would be great if for instance they'd analyze the courses and even cars in the games universe. In addition, it is my understanding, and correct me if I am wrong, that racers would have an hour in every course, the day before the actual race, to get familiar with the course and their car, but in this movie they go the race head first without any prior training and even with a completely new car! Also to me the movie was somehow predictable and I felt that story was kinda cliche, but it is alright.With all said and done, it is a great movie for the gamers, car guys, families and general audience.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","kosmasp","14 August 2023","No pun intended - obviously and as the movie states from the start, the game or rather a clever marketing ""trick"" (idea?) brought someone to live their dream! I myself never got warm with the Gran Turismo game - way too realistic for my taste ... that means, I think they put a lot of effort in it and the game(s) are obviously good ... but never my cup of tea. I was more a Burnout player (or need for speed ... but the other one even more).That all being said and me talking to a friend of mine who is into the game (currently playing to grind some money to get a car that pops up every three or four months or so ... and then get the trophy attached to it) ... and he told me that the movie is really close to reality. Some things have been simplified (time line wise) or likely added (you always need a face - an enemy, Cappa in this case) ... and the one person this is about ... well it wasn't the first tournament they started to find a player ... a racer.The actors are really good and if you like racing games, you could do a lot worse for sure. I did sweat watching some of the races .... looks great visually too. And even if you can guess what will happen - because you know movies work that way ... but apparently reality to a degree too ... anyway, this was fun and there is eye candy for those who are into male individuals ... watch it if you can .. one morally ambigious note involving the police (control), but nothing that will be too much for kids I reckon ...","4/10"

"Gran Turismo","natmavila","30 January 2024","Ah, ""Gran Turismo"" - the film where cars are more expressive than the characters. It's a cinematic equivalent of a joyride: fun in moments, but you wouldn't necessarily want to do it again in a hurry. The movie does a solid job translating the thrill of the game to the big screen, with some adrenaline-pumping racing sequences that had me gripping my popcorn like a steering wheel. It's like the filmmakers put all their skill points into 'visual flair' and 'sound design', but completely forgot to level up 'plot' and 'character development'.The acting is... well, let's just say if there was a race for the Oscars, this film wouldn't exactly be pole position. The cast seems as confused by the script as we are, with performances reminiscent of early 2000s action figures - stiff, but with a surprising range of motion. The lead character's journey from gamer to racer is inspiring on paper, but in execution, it feels like someone trying to beat a racing game on the easiest difficulty: predictable and without much resistance.What saves ""Gran Turismo"" from being a total wreck is its stunning visuals. The racing scenes are genuinely thrilling, and there's a certain charm to how earnestly the film embraces its video game roots. It's the kind of movie you can casually enjoy with friends, especially if you start making your own engine noises. Bottom line, ""Gran Turismo"" doesn't finish first, but it doesn't crash and burn either. It's a comfortable middle-of-the-pack finisher - not a classic, but a decent way to kill a couple of hours. Just maybe don't expect it to rev your cinematic engines to the max.","8/10"

It's the classic underdog story except for something that happens three quarters into the film which I did know about as was interested to see how the movie would handle that tragic event.

It could have been a CGI fest for two hours, instead it told the story incredibly well and blended the Sim world of gamers with reality. The character development is great, as is the Master and Apprentice bond, with the shift from over confident Apprentice and skeptical Master, to a believing Master that is able to encourage a doubting Apprentice. The use of CGI is creative, highlighting when the racer is able to bridge the void between his gaming console and reality. Well worth a watch to understand why auto racing using sims extensively now as part of their operations.","5/10"

I went into this movie thinking it was going to be okay at best, but this movie was a pleasant surprise The story was quite fun to follow, if a little predictable at times. The characters weren't very deep, but decent enough. There was no character that made me want to rub my head into the couch anytime they spoke. The fact it was a glorified advertisement shown through a few times like all the times they say, ""It's not a game. It's a simulator."" That got on my nerves quite a bit. Besides that the racing was pretty decent. Some of the passes were way too easy, but it was nowhere near as bad as some than movies. It isn't Lightning McQueen cutting through 40 cars in a few laps then being stuck at the front for the rest of the race. I thought cars and races looked pretty cool and the failure montage was fun. In summary, It is a pretty good movie and would suggest watching it.","8/10"

"Gran Turismo","trinaboice","31 August 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
The story would be great as just a story, but what makes it even more impressive is that it's based on the real story of Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo player who actually became a professional race car driver! Jann gets to play a stunt double in the movie for the actor who plays him. Sweet!I don't play racing video games but I still really enjoyed this movie!The film was directed by Neill Blomkamp. Writing credtis go to Jason Hall, Zach Baylin, and Alex Tse.THINGS I LIKED:
Archie Madekwe delivers big time in this! I'm thinking this is his big break in Hollywood. Congrats!David Harbour does an excellent job, as always. Fans of the popular Netflix TV show Stranger Things will love him in this.It's great to see Orlando Bloom in something again! He hasn't been in a wide release since 2014! His character is inspired by the real Darren Cox who founded GT Academy to help Sony Playstation give racing gamers a real chance in the world of professional racing drivers.Darren Barnet's character is inspired by the real Brian Heitkotter, who won the GT Academy with Jann Mardenborough in 2011.You'll notice a former Spice Girl in the movie: Geri Halliwell. In real life, she's married to a professional racer for Red Bull: Christian Horner.Djimon Hounsou is underutilized but has one of the most powerful moments in the film.There are so many cool moments in the film. For example, the real Kazunori Yamauchi is the sushi chef in Japan who smiles at Jann.Hungaroring in Hungary was used for many of the racing scenes, designed to look like different locations around the world.Michelin Tires was the official tire partner for the movie, providing all of the rubber in the movie.I love the two songs featured in the movie that the main character listens to a lot: Kenny G: Songbird (1987) and Enya: Orinoco Flow - Sail Away (1988). What do YOU listen to in order to relax, focus, or be inspired by?There is a lot of humor, as well as inspirational lines.The action is exciting and will definitely give gamers the thrill they love. In fact, I love that so many video game elements are included in the telling of this story.Video game movie adaptations used to be notoriously terrible, but are we seeing an uptick of good ones? It sure looks that way. Yay! Two of my four sons work in the video game industry and are thrilled by that.At the end of the movie, we get to see video clips and photographs of the real people involved in the true events told in the movie.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's extremely predictable but I didn't care. This was fun, made even better by the fact that the events in the story really happened!Some have complained that the details in the story aren't entirely accurate. I still didn't care. It's so inspiring and energizing.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some profanity
We see several racing car wrecks.Talk of race car drivers who died in crashes.Bullying.","10/10"

While I may not enjoy all of his work, I can certainly appreciate his talent. I am genuinely delighted for him, especially considering the immense challenge of bringing this film to life. And he absolutely succeeded!This movie is an absolute gem! I had an exceptionally enjoyable experience watching it. David Harbour's portrayal of the mentor character is flawlessly executed. Archie Madekwe seamlessly intertwines with the plot, breathing life into his role as a relatable young man. It's worth mentioning that, despite the fact that this film serves as an advertisement for a gaming giant, it manages to tell a captivating story about a heroic individual pursuing their dreams. The paths to success aren't always straightforward, but fate grants this character an opportunity that he seizes without hesitation. I must express my gratitude to Sony for producing such a remarkable movie. It conjures up sympathy, keeps us on the edge of our seats, and reminds us of the immense power of cinema.The cinematography in this film is nothing short of exceptional, with first-class camerawork and dynamic editing that enhance the overall experience. Additionally, the production itself is masterful, showcasing the director's ability to handle challenging technical tasks with ease.However, there were a few aspects that left me somewhat dissatisfied. One of them being the unresolved storyline surrounding the deceased viewer. While a plot ""twist"" was introduced, there was no proper ""denouement"" that addressed the impact of this tragedy on the main character and how he will navigate his life moving forward. It remains undisclosed.Furthermore, the motive of the ""opponent"" felt superficial and lacked substantial exploration.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","jace_the_film_guy","8 September 2023","I am not a big fan of racing or anything to do with cars, but this movie grabbed my attention and held on. Jann's journey, along with the other sim drivers, is as inspiring as it is entertaining. It was fascinating to see gamers who have raced courses thousands of times have their shot to race the same courses in person. The film showcased some truly brilliant shots of the transition from video game to professional racing.The acting in this film is strong, with standouts from the three lead actors. David Harbour's performance is one of the best of his career, as he embraced the role of grumpy coach without falling into campy over-acting (i.e., ""Black Widow""). His chemistry with the actor who plays Jann, Archie Madekwe, is a highlight of the film. They have a scene together roughly 2/3 into the story that knocked my socks off.As someone who enjoys films based on true stories, I immediately looked up the real events after walking out of the theater. Though most of the movie is factual, there were certain artistic liberties taken which altered the storytelling. This wouldn't have been bothersome, but when the filmmakers advertised ""Based on a True Story"" on every poster, I expected it to be a bit more truthful.Aside from the slightly questionable following of source material, there isn't a lot that I didn't enjoy about ""Gran Turismo"". The acting was strong, the stakes were high, and the core characters had tremendous depth. That being said, I would have liked to see a bit more of Jann's family, as most of those relationships were glossed over.While I have never played the ""Gran Turismo"" video game, I'm eager to try it now. I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of the racing scenes and my nails are down to nothing. The disparity between critic and audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is one of the biggest of 2023 and should not impact your experience. I went into the movie with minimal expectations, and they were surpassed.Best Character: Jack

The dialogue is so poor, it was hard to tell if the acting was any good. Exception being Ginger Spice. I think she acted pretty damn good. Other than her they all did a great job of making a true story very unbelievable. I couldn't relate to anyone, the character dialogue just didn't sound believable.The direction was a bit poor, some very predictable parts and overall just incredibly boring. Had it not been for 4DX, the chance is I would have walked out.That really does sum it up, very unbelievable, poor scripting.

There was a seriousness and sincerity about it I didn't expect.I was so surprised at how much I liked it that I came here on IMDB to see why. I discovered Neill Blomkamp, the director of District 9, did this. And I learned it was based on a true story. No wonder I had the sense this film was made with care and attention to realism.With your basic underdog story, a likable character and some really intense racing scenes, you have a very entertaining film.The filmmakers did a good job with this one.

"Gran Turismo","maidwell-45616","19 October 2023","What a strange movie this is.First off, In 2011 I watched and was hooked by the GT academy series Jann Mardenborough won, I've played and enjoyed the Gran Turismo games, I'm a big Motorsport fan and I appreciate Motorsport based movies like Rush, Le Man 66 (ford v Ferrari), The Art of Racing in the Rain and even Days Of thunder.So with all that in mind I seem like the absolute target audience to have a blast watching this movie.What I felt instead was whiplash from the changes in tone, confused by the innacuracies in timeline and dramatic license being used and bewilderment that the entire movie was allegedly directed by Neill Blomkamp.The first two thirds of the movie seem to be directed solely by a committee of shareholders from Sony and Nissan. It's like an extended advert for both companies with no directorial flourishes or tension at all, it's like a bad Disney live action movie featuring cut out characters.Then we get ""the incident"" and suddenly the movie becomes something different and switches gears into an engaging drama. It seems like this is the bit Blomkamp actually directed and makes the movie as a whole quite a bizarre experience.I'm not sure what others are seeing to give this movie such glowing reviews but for me it can't recover from how cliche' and tropey the first 2 acts are, even if the 3rd act does bring it up to an average standard.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","actionhex","27 January 2024","Gran Turismo's brisk action and feel-good underdog drama are undermined by its loose telling of the fact-based story, but this is still a generally solid racing movie.Based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough, the film is the ultimate wish fulfillment tale of a teenage Gran Turismo player.The movie is a formula, formula of an underdog story and it's full of cliches, but this is an example of a well execution of the common story. Great racing scenes and good acting (especially by David Harbour)! ""Feel good"" movies will always be underrated for various of reasons.If you're a racing fan or you've had fun playing the Gran Turismo games, then this entertaining underdog story is a must-watch movie.","2/10"
"Gran Turismo","mbogich","1 January 2024","Gran Turismo is the greatest formula racing movie ever made. Wait, scratch that. What I meant to write was Gran Turismo is the most formulaic racing movie ever made. It is the product of a paint by numbers approach to making a sports movie; an underdog story, filled with self-doubt, overwhelming odds, montages, and every cliche you've ever seen. But there is a twist to Gran Turismo, something that I wasn't expecting at all, something that actually made the movie even more terrible. But more on that later...The movie is about a young gamer (""sim racer"") who is exceptional at the video game (""race simulator"") Gran Turismo, and wants one day to be a real life race car driver. He soon gets his chance when Nissan sponsors a Gran Turismo tournament, the winners of which will be trained to compete in reality based racing, you know, with actual cars. So, you guessed it, he wins the video game tournament and goes on to win Le Mans, the greatest achievement a professional racer can achieve.That's the plot, minus a few hackneyed details. Gran Turismo is essentially nerd porn. It shows the journey from gaming in mom's basement to real life fortune and glory; from dominating in a virtual reality to dominating in the real world; from watching internet porn to interacting with human females. It feels so fantastical and lazily contrived that I was shocked when the movie took an unexpected turn.If you're not one of the forty two people who follows professional racing, you'll be as shocked as I was to find out that this terrible movie is, in fact, based on a true story. Gran Turismo feels so fake and seems so stupid that I was shocked to find out that it has any basis in reality. This makes the movie worse, because, in real life, the story it tells is actually interesting. So, when the movie turns out this bad, it means filmmakers didn't just execute their own idea poorly, but instead they took an interesting and real story and made it suck.Now, why does the movie suck, you ask? To save myself (and the two or three people who will ever read this) some time, I will give a bulleted list of my grievances with Gran Turismo:-Lots of cliches: ""Can I do it,"" the hero asks himself. ""Can he do it,"" those around the hero ask each other. ""He can do it,"" the mentor tells the nay sayers. ""Your dreams are a fantasy,"" the dad tells his son. ""No they're not,"" the son tells his dad. Almost every second of Gran Turismo is something you have seen before in a better movie.-Absurd levels of product placement: It is easy to figure out who paid for GranTurismo, because there isn't one minute in the entire movie without the Nissan or Sony logo in it. And there also endless discussion about how Gran Turismo ""is more than a game.""-Montages: Once the movie gets going, it is non-stop montages with licensed music. There's at least seventy two mintages in the movie.-Unexciting driving scenes: I understand that watching a whole race would be boring, that's why no one does it. But the race scenes are also, you guessed it, just montages. Gran Turismo does not translate the excitement of driving at hundreds of miles per hour onto the big screen. The racing scenes are cut together with shots that are on average a half a second long. There is no excitement and no tension builds, despite the incredible efforts to manufacture some. There is also a terrible shot in Gran Turismo when the main character is about to execute a crucial maneuver on the track. The shot shows a profile view of the car racing forward, then the car becomes digitized and starts to fade away leaving only the main character. Then the background fades and we see him playing the Gran Turismo game in his room. It's as though the filmmakers are saying, ""no need to feel any excitement; all of this is a digital and fake. Just thought we'd let you know."" Why call so much attention to the fact that 99% of the driving in the movie is filmed in front of a green screen? It's a really dumb use of digital effects-actually, it's pretty much the opposite of what they were made for.-Dishonesty: At the end of Gran Turismo, the main character wins Le Mans. I did some research: he came in third. This leads me to wonder what else did the filmmakers take liberties with? I didn't care enough to look it up.If you want to watch a great racing movie based on a real story, watch Ford v Ferrari. If you just want to watch a racing movie that's better than this, it's a safe bet that any of them will do.","10/10"

In addition to this film being so easy and enticing to watch, it also did something else that was very special for me; it inspired me to chase my own dreams and gave hope that all dreams, no matter how crazy they may seem, are POSSIBLE!

Two of the games I love playing on PlayStation are Need for Speed and Gran Turismo. And I love F1 racing, so when a movie comes out that combines both, you got my money. Esp when it's actually based off a true story of a black dude who changed F1 racing.This movie was simply amazing. The cinematography was just beautiful. I loved the cast. It's been such a while since I saw Orlando Bloom and Djimon in a movie so seeing them here was very refreshing. But what blew me away was the fact that CHH was featured TWICE. First Andy Mineo with Coming in Hot and then later, Tedashii with Get out my way. It was sooooo cool. The guys are Reach Records are doing something right.If you love car racing, adrenaline pumping, sports, true story then you'll have a blast watchung this. I definitely did.Oh I forgot to mention, the incredible special Fx used in this movie was just siiiiiick. You have to play the game to appreciate it.","7/10"

The Cinematography was Great, I liked the way the overall film looked.2. David Harbour Carries This Film, Also Him and Orlando Blooms Chemistry Bouncing off eachother was Good to See.3. The Race Scenes were Good and Many of the Moments (Crashes) were Amazing ""Moments in Time"" Moments4. The Plotline was Solid.Problems I had with the Film -1. Many of the Edits (During the Racing) were too Choppy, too Many Quick Cuts. I understand they were going for fast paced but imo They should Let some of the Shots Linger and Flow, so we can take in the Shots and Cinematography during the Races.2. Many of the Races (Although Good to Watch) Lacked Suspense, you just knew he was going to Accomplish what he was going to Accomplish (Apart from 1 particular Race). They needed to cast some doubt during the Races, let the races linger longer, character doubt, tough maneuvers, stop the quick edits etc.Overall, it's a Good Film with some Amazing Moments (Crashes).","10/10"

I am a huge anime fan and while this movie wasn't about anime at all it left me with the same inspired, ready to run through a wall feels that anime so often leaves me with! It is well worth your time if you are looking for something that isn't full of petty drama and goes straight to the point. No antics, gimmicks, etc. It was just real (at least it felt real). I will say this though, I never looked into how much of the movie was real vs. Hollywood production but again the feel I was left with was real. I think that's what makes it so great it has so many characteristics of a quality anime but it is based on a true story! Idk just check it out and see for yourself.","8/10"

He started playing racing games and his passion for the sport grew.Danny Moore is working for Nissan Marketing. He decides to take the best SIM racers in the world and put them in real cars to compete. Achieving the fastest lap race time on his Gran Turismo Playstation game, Jann is selected for the trials. Jann finally makes it into the Top 20, and is inching his way forward to fulfilling his dream.The film depicts the training Jann and four other drivers goes through, coached by former driver Jack Salter (David Harbour). The film is based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough. Doing further research on Jann, I learnt he was co-producer, stunt driver and consultant on the movie, so I think we can safely assume the events in the movie are pretty accurate.Director Neill Blomkamp returns to form with 'Gran Turismo'. The visual effects are fantastic and the editing is just as fast as the racing cars, resulting in a fast-paced movie that never disappoints. I enjoyed the characters and thought the actors did a great job bringing them to life. I especially enjoyed David Harbour as Jack Salter. The characters felt realistic and not clich√©d. The film also has a great score and excellent cinematography.If its racing movies you like, you will love 'Gran Turismo'. If you're a fan of the game, you will love 'Gran Turismo'. If you enjoy action movies that doesn't rely on blazing guns and superhero action, chances are you will love 'Gran Turismo'. I found it thrilling and exciting and there truly never was a dull moment. I believe the underlying message here is never to give up on your dreams... This is a wonderful, feel-good movie!","2/10"

The overtakes are silly and never do you have the feeling that you are watching a real race.This has assembled as one big marketing commercial for a racing game.

It makes zero sense, apparently if you accelerate harder, brake harder or steer harder you win the race.They take a team of 3 rookie drivers to le mans and put them in the race without them ever driving the car?I did enjoy this movie, for what reason I don't know, but the first hour was horrific, the second hour was much better, but still very cringeyThe real guy the movie is based on has only ever won a single race, and it wasn't Le Mans, The entire film feels like an advertisement for the new Gran Turismo game.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","851222","13 November 2023","Greetings from Lithuania.""Gran Turismo"" (2023) is a pretty good sports movie based on a racing video game and true story that happened to one of its players. I personally love Gran Turismo 7 and while not being the best player (far from it), i do enjoy it very much. And this is plus for me because i saw some stuff that only could gamer have seen it - like small details here and there. But that is not the point - even if you don't play this game i would recommend movie because at its run time 2 h 8 min. I was involved into it. Acting by David Harbour was good enough to carry this movie and Djimon Hounsou stole every scene he was in. And lead Archie Madekwe - lets just say he still has a lot to learn. Directing by Neill Blomkamp wasn't his best by far, but it solid enough for this movie.Overall, ""Gran Turismo"" isn't a great movie, but its solid enough to recommend it. And yes it did felt like a commercial for the game and console, but hey, those are great things they were advertising.","6/10"
"Gran Turismo","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","25 July 2023","If this wasn't a true story, I wouldn't have believed its premise. For those who don't know, what happened was the best global GT sim racers were offered to compete against each other and become an actual professional race car driver in the circuit. Thankfully the movie adaptation has vast commentary on the safety concerns behind the competition with no need to get into the legalities and paperwork, and the movie has some of those concerns brought to life on screen. I will admit to not following up with the true story itself (largely because part of me doesn't want to know), but for a movie that wants to emulate the true story, it seems to have taken creative liberties when it wanted to and then missed out on opportunities to take more creative liberties where it could have.Before I get into any of that, let me start off by saying that if in the audience's eyes a film is a win if it gets seemingly better as it progresses, then Gran Turismo did its job. Moments at the end were paid off by what was set up earlier on, scenes had the chance to breathe (including racing moments), and characters all came together when earlier on they spent most of the time apart from each other. I'll also say that I had trepidation entering this film because if they had decided to integrate a lot of the video game into this adaptation (which they did), I don't know how it would translate for audiences who don't know of or care about the game; I'm here to say that I think it does enough to let casual moviegoers to be subservient to its entertainment value while being aware of the virtual entertainment this thing is based around, so long as you are entertained by the story itself.Gran Turismo does this cool thing where, when the character is playing the game early on, they sometimes use visual effects to simulate that of a real life driver (or kind of go into ""replay mode"" of the game when it can), and conversely in some of the real life driving/racing scenes, they use many of the game's audial/visual elements and sometimes make it a game-like experience. Whether it's the classical red-yellow-green start sounds, the racer's position showing above their car in the shot (sometimes in a freeze-frame, which I'll get to why they do that later), the race leaderboard and track layout interface you're familiar with from the game's HUD, the suggested driver lines including brake zones, and sometimes (albeit rarely) they show the follow cam that the game is known for having. Whenever there is a scene in a different part of the world, they show it in the same classic way as the game does with its font and its country's flag.The only real nitpicks I have with that though is that they do frantic jumping around early on in the film like you see in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and literally every place that you go to there is some sort of indicator immediately thereafter that you're there anyway. This isn't verbatim, but for example if the movie transported us to Tokyo and the text reads TOKYO, JAPAN, ten seconds later a character will say: ""Thanks for inviting me to Tokyo."" I get you're following the game, but I say in that case do one or the other. They also had a non-racing moment where they use a video game-like cue (I do not know if this is a part of GT or not), and they had a golden opportunity to use it as a comedic punchline immediately after but never did, which is too bad. In all, I think they melded a lot of the video game in post-production moments and it should entice gamers without distracting too much from others who maybe haven't played the game.There is an act of this movie focused on training the gamers to compete against one another which has shades of what Top Gun: Maverick delivered, but it only lives in its shadow. Yes, they make the audience aware of forces on the body, real life consequences versus simulation resets, and a few debriefs between sessions, but it doesn't evolve very well with a lot of training/racing coverage, and instead stays with quick-cut montages. I suppose if you know where the rest of the story goes and the film's actual runtime (which I didn't, another fault of this portion which TG:M is clear on), then maybe you'll be more accepting of this in the moment, but by me not being aware this is an instance where I would be forgiving if the movie was longer in favor of it. Instead, some of this runtime is spent developing some characters who you'll never see again later. One could argue this would have worked better as a limited series, but as a cinema aficionado I prefer its big-screen gamble. I just think there is more story to embellish on that had to be cut away.And by the way, speaking of the training, I have a hard time believing that a game which makes 60% of its sales in international markets (and 25% in Asia) would only feature victors which are nearly all perfect English speakers or from the UK. Maybe that actually happened or maybe this is where they take their liberties, but I found that to be a bit far-fetched when this is a game source from Japan as I am willing to bet the majority of elite GT racers are Japanese. Maybe I am wrong. They also made a mistake in their competitive race giving all of the drivers the same car color; you can take creative liberties here, but the only way you know who our protagonist driver is is by them freeze-framing and pointing it out to us.Also, Gran Turismo is known as ""the real driving simulator,"" which is their excuse when we don't get things in the game such as damage modeling or overzealous senses of speed through depth of field or car engines as something like Forza Motorsport does. It is for the love of the cars. Yet, this film does not seem to do that as much. I suppose this is where I have a bit of a disconnect being a fan of the game, because the movie never gives those moments that the game (or this real life story) should best be known for. The movie makes a big stink about these gamers who have spent thousands of hours on certain tracks, yet they never key into discussion on their prowess of it, which would be really vindicating cinematic moments. Instead, the majority of their training is running, which I no doubt believe is something they have to do a lot of but we could be better educated on what they are doing to mentally improve as racers as well. These little details help better inform the audience, especially what it means to commit to a line, build draft behind another car (which they never do), and even when the movie points out the resentment that other professional racers had against gamers entering the circuit it doesn't become a bigger plot point or focus afterward. Our protagonist gets one moment to see some social media reels about commemorating him for entering professionally, but never ran into any of the blowback which would show some of the emotional struggle he has to go through. You also see weird inconsistencies like drivers depressing clutch pedals when they are paddle-shifting instead of using a gearbox.As I said before, save the final race the shooting coverage is very quick and minimalized, and largely incoherent. It's a shame too, because this could have been a great 4DX/D-BOX experience overall but I don't know if it will fall to the fray of seats ""moving because things are happening."" For the action they have to tell more than show as a result, but it's hard to figure out this movie's pacing too because you don't know where it's leading to until it gets there. As far as you're concerned, the gamers are going to compete in a race together and it could imply that you'll see its winner race professionally. So that happens and they do, then you get into a professional race, and then afterward you're suddenly now informed that it's just race one of seven? Then even after that seventh race, it's revealed that there is another big-big race that would need loads of prep work beforehand? Maybe I want the story focus to be elsewhere, but these are the things that movies like Ford v Ferrari did so excellently in its storytelling (not to mention the way the races were shot and edited). Thankfully, that last act of the movie really did improve what was shown before, but the first 2/3 of the movie sometimes felt like 90-minute an AI-written trailer.You'd think that a lot of what I said makes me come out of this movie with a negative experience, but that is not the case at all. In the end (no pun intended) it as a net-positive experience, but this is a movie that I see either could have been great or had a lot of missed opportunities despite its true story. Although I admittedly was okay on Chappie and never saw Elysium, based on critic and audience response alone, this will easily be Neill Blomkamp's best effort since District 9, a movie which I very much enjoy. David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou bring fun and powerful performances, respectively, and the racing shots all seem practical (with a lot of drone shots that can look video game-y which is cool), save one shot that required CGI and for good reason. The real person this story is based on even got to be a stunt-double for the actor portraying him, which was a nice touch. I think this movie ends up being a celebratory crowd experience which makes it worth seeing in theaters, and I think many people will have fun with where this movie goes overall. I just see a movie that will sometimes pale to other movies that compare to it especially when it is so close to them in narrative and release timing, but on its own merits it's absolutely a fun experience both for GT fans and casual moviegoers. If nothing else, it's absolutely a ringing endorsement for Gran Turismo as a video game and Sony as a corporation. I wish nothing but success for this film and maybe later I'll get to look up the passage of time for the actual true story.","2/10"

"Gran Turismo","tm-sheehan","17 August 2023","My Review-Gran Turismo (2023)
My Rating 8/10I was surprised how much I enjoyed this very entertaining and interesting movie as I'm certainly not a racing car fan or video game nerd .Based on true events it's quite an inspirational story of Jann Mardenborough played very impressively by Archie Madekwe.The movie title Gran Turismo or GT) is derived from a series of racing simulation video games developed by Polyphony Digital and produced by Kazunori Yamauchi with an estimated production budget of 100 million US$.The film's story begins in 2008 with teenager Jann Mardenborough an obsessed and skilful Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills eventually win a series of Nissan competitions to become an actual professional racecar driver.Orlando Bloom is very well cast as Danny Moore a former Nissan Europe Corporate executive who pitches his revolutionary concept to Japanese Nissan executives of forming a GT International Academy to select by suitable candidates with exceptional gaming skills to train as professional racing car drivers telling them the sales of the video games will produce amazing profits for the company with increased sales.The idea is accepted with the provision that Danny Moore hires an expert engineer to ensure there are no accidents or injuries that will reflect badly on the Nissan Corporation.Jack Salter outstandingly played by David Harbour is hesitant at first because training amateur car racers to risk life and limb in the International racing circuit sounds like insanity but when he is insulted and devalued by his current employer he hops on board to train a dozen young candidates of which Jann Mardenborough a young man from Cardiff eventually turns out his star pupil.One of the aspects of this movie that impressed me was the performance of Archie Madekwewho who I had only seen in one forgettable 2019 movie Midsommer his portrayal of Jann Mardenbrough was nuanced ,well mannered and touching without the super ego that's often on display with sporting heroes as the story of his triumphs and disastrous setbacks unfolds I was inspired by his strength of character even though I cannot understand why anyone would risk their life constantly behind the wheel of a supersonic vehicle.The last racing car film I saw was Ford vs Ferrari which I also surprisingly enjoyed I gave that a 9/10.Director Neill Blomkamp and screenplay writers Jason Hall and Zach Baylin have given us a thrilling and very interesting story based on true events the amazing camera work and special effects from Jacques Jouffret and production designer Martin Whist are some of the best I've seen this year.I was interested to read that the racing stunt double used in the movie for Archie Madekwe was in fact the real Jann Mardenborough .I liked this movie very much and thoroughly recommend Gran Turismo .","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","alindsayal","14 August 2023","I have an interest in all sport and that includes motor sport as that is a big thing going on in my household. So when Gran Turismo was announced to be made into a film, I knew I was going to be watching it. Yesterday, I watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man who is one of the greatest Gran Turismo players in the world given the chance to become a professional race car driver.Main Character
Archie Madekwe plays the real life person of Jann Mardenborough and he is okay in this film. He is a pretty easy person to relate to and want to see succeed. The whole premise of this persons life is insane and I think Archie managed to convey that and he had some really good scenes with some of the stronger actors. But I also think there were a few missed opportunities, where he is meant to take charge and it doesn't quite work, he mumbles and you can tell he hasn't quite nailed it yet as a leading man. I think this is a good step for him and hopefully we can see more of him in the future.Supporting Characters
There is an experienced but small supporting cast. Dave Harbour plays Jack Salter, the chief engineer of the team and he is truly fantastic in this role, you can tell he is super passionate about this film and this role and he delivers a memorable performance and one that shows his strength as an actor.Orlando Bloom hasn't done much the last few years but he is good here playing Danny Moore who is the marketing and head of the programme. He is charismatic and also looks like he is having a great time, he doesn't have as much depth as some of the other characters but he is just a fun addition of the film.Djimon Hounsou plays Jann's father and he is great in his smaller role. There is a clear conflict between the two of them in terms of Jann's aspirations and dreams. But Hounsou delivers some strong scenes and even though he isn't in the film a lot he is pretty memorable.Story
The story is pretty crazy and the fact that the majority is true is even crazier. Don't let the title of the film trick you, this is not a video game movie. It has a strong story that sees this young man look to get his dream, it is a pretty simple underdog story but it is done well enough for sure. They squeeze his rise into this one film and I am sure there is more to the plot but I appreciated how the story was told. But I felt like everything not involving the racing was a bit dull, for example there is a romance which is really underdeveloped and the two characters barely share scenes together so it made me wonder why I should care.Script
The script is a bit of a mixed bag. This film takes itself very seriously and for the most part it is done effectively, you care about the people and the situations they are in. The humour is chuckle worthy and it doesn't overstep and the balance is well down. There are just parts of the film that aren't written as well and that I didn't care about as much.Style
The film looks great, all the driving scenes are well filmed and make it feel like you are in the car with the characters. It incorporated the video game aspects well that it didn't overbear the film and allowed the focus to be on the actual driving. The film was paced pretty well too, keeping me interested for the majority of the film.Overall
Overall, Gran Turismo is a good film. It doesn't matter if you have ever played the video game or even are a fan of the sport, I think this could be a film you enjoy and should give a chance.Rating - 7/10.","10/10"

Adrenaline rush throughout. Should be among the best movies of all times. Wish I could have watched this in a theatre. Not sure how much close this is to the reality,but I would not want to think about it. It is so wonderfully made, it keeps you on the edge throughout the run. And any movie that does that certainly need the accolades. And as I said... Heart throbbing, Heart Stopping, Goosebumps all the way! One of the rare movies which can be watched over and over again and still get Goosebumps every time.","4/10"
"Gran Turismo","v0lk4n","28 September 2023","Big fan of the game since PS1 till that day. Trailer gave me no thrills so i was expecting nothing but no! Way worse than trailer. Guys ! Even GT (is a half-sim) has some reality way more than this. For starters Whats with the Hungaroring? Silverstone Academy is reverse Hungaroring, Le Mans (La Sarthe) is regular Hungaroring.... In racing there is no wiggly helmets; cars don't explodes, engines do, there are no spotters except ovals!; track races have qualies, you don't start in the middle of nowhere; you dont pass your opponent with down shifts and sudden throttle; GT3 cars are fast as any car on straights; Le Mans 24H doesn't finish at the last lap; it finishes at the end of 24 hours + 1 lap; Nurburgring is 20.83 km and if you crash in the middle of it nobody waves yellow flags in start-finish straight. I could have add more but i am already bored. Good soundtrack, good cinematography, well blended CGI but no soul and no technical aspect. I dont even know how Yamauchi San gave his blessing to this as himself a real deal racing driver. Lastly this film is the second DRIVEN disaster IMO.","8/10"

I think its a way to save the company by producing such a kiddish movie.. by putting true story on the description will give the movie the weight that they request. When it comes to movie scenario, no competitors going to the race just to stop other opponent.. all of these racers are representing a worthy brand and they are not looking to do dirty actions on purpose.. also by grabbing a kid from a console to drive 700hp car is not doable.. my own perspective on this movie that its just marketing and propaganda to move the still water at Nissan.. nothing else.","4/10"
"Gran Turismo","hansped","28 September 2023","Okay, so this movie, or rather the decisions that the production have made, confuses me.To get the basic points over with: I like the casting. I think the acting is good overall. The script is OK but not much more, but I would say it makes for a decent watch. The movie could based on these point be an OK entertaining movie.What makes it a total trainwreak for me is all the blantant wrongs in how racing and motorsports work. It makes no sense! Why make a movie about motorsport, based on a supposedly realistic game, and then not make the racing realistic?To give an example. During a series of races, mid movie, they portray some kind of major league racing series. The protaginists bigges hurdle during these races isn't his lack of experience. His main hurdle is another driver continuously ramming him on purpose, race after race. During the series first race he rams the protagonist who spins out at almost ends up in a wall! HE WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE RACING! A driver lika that would be disqualified and probably get his licenses revoked. And someone in the production must have known that's how it works! Couldn't they figure out any other way to build suspense?Then there is a lot of smaller details that's just lazy beyond sense. For example. When a car gets in to what would most likely have been a fatal crash and covers an entire section of the track with debrie and fluids they yellow-flag it instead of red-flagging it. They restart the race before the driver of the crashed car event gets of the track.It's just lazy and I can't see anyone knowing anything about motorsport enjoying this movie. And it could have been desent.","6/10"
"Gran Turismo","SnoopyStyle","29 September 2023","Marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) pitches a crazy idea to Nissan motorsport and developer of the video game Gran Turismo. It's a contest to find a top game player who can be transformed into a real world driver. Former driver and engineer Jack Salter (David Harbour) is tired of the diva drivers and agrees to manage his program. Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) had always wanted to be a racing driver, but his father Steve Mardenborough (Djimon Hounsou) insists on limiting his dream.Director Neill Blomkamp brings this real life story to the big screen. I'm only a casual racing fan. I think I remember Jann driving. It's a compelling story and well suited to the underdog sports movie genre. I like the young actor playing the lead although David Harbour is the more compelling one. It's a very standard true story movie. The drama is never that surprising. The racing sequences are fine. It's all fine like a simulation of the real thing.","9/10"

But, obviously being a Gamer Man, I have played similar Games with racing like Burn Out 2 & the Grand Theft Auto series! So, of course, I do have good knowledge of Racer Games & myself felt like I was playing as I watched the film! That, & of course I've seen Grand Prix racing on TV & similar Films like this one, so I basically knew what to expect despite not knowing the true story!The film is based on the unbelievable, inspiring true story of Jann Mardenborough, die hard Gran Turismo player who's given the opportunity of a lifetime to compete in the European Race Circuit after winning a Gran Turismo Gaming Simulation! Together with an retired Racer Jack Salter & Nissan Exce Danny Moore, the 3 pull off the impossible!I found the film to be really good! It was brilliant! It's 2 hours & 6 minutes of racing, Adrenalin & feel good moments leaving wanting more & exhilarated til the finish line! The films story is good & inspiring, even though it was based off of a true story anyway, it was still a great story & one that needed to be brought to the big screen!The characters are great in this! Some were actual racers in real life which added to the authenticity to the film, hey, even Jann Mardenborough himself was a stand in for the stunts preformed in this film which was ace! There's plenty of action & some touching scenes as well as some eye candy too... Emelia Hartford though! Hottie!Overall, it's an ace film! It was brilliant! Love every minute of it! Although I did feel the film dragged a tad bit, it was nonetheless, a great edge of your seat Adrenalin filled film! It's epic, well made, well written & well directed! If you're a fan of Racing, Cars, Videos Games, in particular, Gran Turismo! You'll love this! Trust me!9/10.","6/10"

Overall, I was somewhat disappointed. Given the quality of films have been reaching theaters lately. This film is geared towards very young men. And it attempts to glorify something that most of us have come to know, and even our surgeon general has flagged our society about: isolating oneself and becoming obsessed with virtual reality. It is all packaged within some clever special effects, however, the underlying message to viewers is someone counterintuitive, since it's the very topic that is falling under scrutiny by healthcare professionals. It wouldn't be so bad if the quality of the film or higher, but there's just no substance or depth in this presentation.","2/10"

Not sure if it's his acting or just poorly written! I didn't feel like you could connect with any of the characters as they are pretty soulless and have extremely little back story so you can't really connect or care about them. It's a shame they didn't make it more about the game instead of trying to make a convincing racing movie.I guess the idea is to watch this as more of a computer game movie than an actual film about racing.

Anyone who doesn't probably doesn't know anything about movies and only claims to watch heavy dramas. Well, this is indeed a heavy drama. This is everything a top-tier movie should be.I'll assume you remember the not-so-distant ""racing"" spectacle ""Ford vs Ferrari,"" or as some call it, ""Le Mans '66."" That film was nominated for an Oscar in 2019, and just like this one, it's based on true events and falls into the biographical film category. ""Gran Turismo"" is on par with that film in terms of quality, and if there's any justice, it will get a ticket to the Dolby Theatre next year.","8/10"

The racing sequences could have been more attractive and breath taking.But these flaws won't prevent me from giving a high score to Gran Turismo because I enjoyed it, and I see it as a significant improvement when it comes to video game movie adaptations. That is why regarding the score, I give Gran Turismo 8 out of 10.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","noshouse","8 September 2023","Although the trailer's music and pacing feel different from the typical racing films, it's totally fine. Playing video games is a common leisure activity for many people. From childhood, we started with games where the computer used a keyboard. When it came to racing games, we used a joystick. As we grew older, games had joysticks, and racing games had dedicated steering wheel joysticks. As we got even older, racing games came with specialized seats and pedals. Yes, racing-themed content is all about that sense of speed, and this movie will definitely satisfy that. Unlike 'Alivehoon,' this film is based on the true story of Yang-Martinborough, and his proactive and enthusiastic pursuit of becoming a race car driver has been quite inspiring from the beginning.","4/10"

I mean, they went all out, gathered the cr√®me de la cr√®me of terrible Hollywood screenwriters, and somehow managed to cram every lousy action clich√© into this one flick, effectively obliterating what could have been an epic story.And let's not forget the direction - it's so horrendous that even Disney's worst films would be ashamed.Now, the characters are pure caricatures. You've got your classic setup of the kind-hearted underdog battling the evil rich dude, the sweet girlfriend, and a posse of nerdy sidekicks. It's all so predictable and shallow, and the acting..........I generously give it a 4 out of sheer love for the game.

That being said, the rest of it was very good. The direction here was quite good... almost using things from the game to clearly let you know where the main character was in the racing field. The racing scenes are quite good and exciting. David Harbour is excellent as the mentor and Archie Madekwe was excellent as Jann Mardenborough. Apparently there was controversy about the accident that they have in the movie, that really happened. To me that seems crazy. I give the movie great credit for using it.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","masonsaul","12 August 2023","Gran Turismo is one of the most excessively corporate films in quite a while and it's overly long but despite all that it remains an endearing underdog story that uses the familiarity of its racing rendition of the Rocky story to really good effect.Archie Madekwe makes sure Jann is confident without ever becoming annoying and remains a likeable lead throughout. David Harbour is the best thing in it, the resentment he has of Jann that slowly grows into respect is the heart of the film and he delivers a great motivational speech.Orlando Bloom's businessman is slimy without being completely irredeemable and Djimon Hounsou gets to show a level of emotion rarely seen at this scale that offers a welcome reminder he's damn good when given the opportunity.Neill Blomkamp was an unusual pick to direct this but it turns out he was actually a solid choice. He gets the camera as close to the racing and inner workings of the cars as possible. He melds the game and real world together effectively and the drone shots aren't awful for once.","10/10"

For sure the compositions of Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Bill Ward and Geezer Butler bring an adrenaline over the scene that has your band playing!It's a great movie, with great racing scenes.

He has an opportunity to show it by being accepted by the Nissan GT invitational to see who will become one. He keeps training until his hard work pays off by fully accomplishing his dream.Overall, I thought it was a good movie based on a true story! Madewe plays Mardenboro in a good underdog role who never backs down and earns respect by doing the work. Hearing that it came from a young adult's true story made me like the movie even more.The acting was great by everyone especially as David Harbour playing the hard-hitting coach Jack Salter in a well-received role. The action from cars racing and crashes was fun to watch. The movie as a whole reminded me of Ford Vs. Ferrari (2019) because of the story, races, and the locations on where they drove. Director Neil Blomkamp does a good job of portraying life isn't more than a just video game, but as a career as well. Overall, Gran Turismo is good with its story, acting, and action.

"Gran Turismo","talking_about_movies","20 August 2023","This is a very simple underdog story about a gamer who was selected as a racer in a special marketing strategy by Nissan.I had fun with this movie. It has an energetic vibe and a fast enough pace, which keeps you entertained for almost all of its runtime. I thought the acting in this movie was very good. Especially by Archie Madekwe as the main character, Jann Mardenborough, and David Harbour as the coach, Jack Salter, who was my favourite character in the movie. These 2 characters are the heart of the movie, and they are what gave this movie the strong emotional push that it needed in the 2nd act. The direction by Neill Blomkamp is also pretty good. It's nice to see a different movie from him. I thought the racing scenes could have been a bit more grounded rather than stylish. But I had fun with the little things he did during the racing scenes that compared the real races to video games. Some of the racing scenes in the 2nd act are actually very thrilling and the sound design had a huge role in that. I also really cared for Jann's character. Who doesn't love an underdog? There's also one particular direction the story took in the 2nd act, that was almost shocking and added a lot more emotional weight to the story.But compared to some of the classic racing movies like Ford v Ferrari, this one is very easy-going. It has a lot less thrills than I would have liked it to have. There are thrills though for sure. But the final race of this movie was just underwhelming. There weren't really any setbacks in that race, and if there were, they were overcome pretty easily. Which is why the conclusion didn't quite feel earned. The characters and the relationships between them too aren't well explored. Given the 2+ hour runtime, they could've been.This is a fun movie for sure, and one you'll enjoy watching with a group of people. It doesn't have a dull moment, it's stylish, action-packed and it's a nice underdog story. The payoff though, is pretty underwhelming and could've been made a lot more impactful than it was.","1/10"

One thing doesn't exist and the other would make you spin out of control and crash your car.The script is total clich√©, with the regular sensationalist distortion of the real story, while the racing itself fails miserably.The acting is ok but not great at any point, as the people involved obviously know nothing about racing, so the passion is not there.Listen to any podcast or watch any documentary about the real driver on YouTube and you'll have a lot of fun, because as always, the real story is always better and more magical than what Hollywood comes up with.This movie is an insult to racing fans.

I have none of those to say about Gran Turismo.The beginning of the movie is very 'Ready Player One'ish' as it introduces you to a character you'll inevitably be following the whole movie.From there, the movie really becomes good. The story is obviously great, but what carries the movie is how the two main characters show & act their emotions. I don't think you could've chosen 2 better leads.The lead actors are spectacular, and the main character's father (who's a famous actor as well) is as always, superb.I'm not sure why these critics are saying this movie has no soul.

Although he is an underdog the plot could be better crafted.Second of all, if you see the movie without any knowledge of Motorsport, it's an acceptable film, a little generic and goes for ""play it safe"", but not that bad.Anyhow, as someone that has been involved in motor sports, it lacks of realism. Clearly not a biographical motion picture. More of a propagandistic piece for nissan than an actual artwork. There are so many errors portrayed while representing motor sport that the whole movie just becomes offensive for real drivers, fans and ""motorheads"".In conclusion, if anybody is about to make a movie about racing cars, the minimum effort expected is to learn anything about cars before even attempting to do the actual footage.P.s. One of the most remarkable errors in the movie is the start of the 24h of Le Mans. Traditionally drivers run to their cars at the beginning of the race and in the movie they just begin with the engine started an in the grid as in a GT or F1 format.","5/10"

The kid acted like he knew everything about racing without any/much real life training. It also gives excuses to kids that if you play games you could be a professional someday, I bet his dad is glad he didn't play war games. Which brings me to that subject why stop there why not hire kids to kill people (not including the unlucky car fan that was for some reason standing alone when a upside down racing car came at em) but like in an Assassins game or better yet get kids to fly commercial airlines? It was lucky that all the qualifying kids in the movie was slim enough to fit in the cars too and looked like racing drivers.The only thing that made the movie worth watching was David Harbour (Jack Salter) acting he was the only thing good in the movie. I know this was based of a true story but the way film makers putting this together just to keep your attention is ridiculous. However I did like the fact that the kid didn't become first/second place, it made it slightly more realistic.BTW if you want to know my credentials I have made thousands of reviews and I am an expert on putting words next to other words.

"Gran Turismo","gahagansue","30 December 2023","I was not familiar with this story at all. I am not into gaming or racing. Really could not care less about either one. However, I really enjoyed this movie. A LOT. I loved the movie, Rocky, too even though I was not (and still am not) a fan of boxing. This movie stands on its own as one that explores family relationships, being your own person, overcoming fear, and meeting challenges head on. The casting was excellent as was the acting. My only disappointments are that (in my opinion) there was not a memorable music score or impressive cinematography which, along with the notion that I haven't decided if Gran Turismo would warrant my watching it a second time now that I know the ending is why I gave this film 8 rather than 10 stars.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","benjaminskylerhill","10 August 2023","This was far better than I expected it to be. Even with its bloated runtime, rough CGI, and overstuffed plot, Gran Turismo is mostly well-acted, features many heartfelt and compelling scenes, and boasts terrific sound mixing and editing that heighten the speed and danger of the racing sequences.Sport biopic formula is predictably followed, but the central characters are given plenty of depth and unique traits to make their interactions largely believable and sometimes moving.Although the lack of color grading sometimes makes the film look ugly, some clever gleefully gimmicky directing choices give the driving footage a dose of video-game-feeling and it makes them unique to watch.I certainly didn't love everything about this, but I found myself pleasantly surprised by how often I was getting wrapped up in the story and how often the filmmaking impressed me.Video game movies are getting pretty good, and I'm here for it.","8/10"

I was shocked to find out it was based on a real story and actually is close to the truth. The acting is fine and had a good mix of action and drama. I would recommend to anyone looking for a easy watch. Some decent big named actors as supporting cast and the young lad that plays the lead character is likeable. I played the game growing up so was quite interested in the story and I think they executed it well. Yes they are a few bits you might question but it's a fun fairy tale story, lighten up and just enjoy it!","10/10"

Passion, courage, emotional strength, human spirit, love, drama, performances of a LIFETIME! All of it expertly choreographed to create the greatest movie of the year and maybe of the last decade. Admittedly, I went into it thinking it was going to be bad like everything else that comes out today in Hollywood, especially since it was a movie about a video game. But here I am after watching it feeling like it literally changed my life. How did they pull this off??? Holy hell it was good. Good job everyone that put effort into this!","2/10"
"Gran Turismo","mrwilliams-20230","21 August 2023","Gran Turismo as a game series is an accessible, arcade-leaning racing game but uses this movie to advertise itself as a true revolutionary modern simulation equal to the likes of Assetto Corsa/iRacing ect, but they also have a larger purpose of helping unappreciated gamers become professional athletes (like the protagonist always planned, apparently). This is as accurate as the rest of the movie.As a fan of gt and Le'Mans racing, I appreciated the real sponsors and tracks in the film, though spent the entire movie frustrated at the inconsistency and lies as the film reduces actual racing series to the chaos of a Gran Turismo race with deliberate crashing into each other without punishment, glorifying incorrect driving techniques and no practise/qualifying sessions. As with most car films, I forgave the drivers peering at each other mid race, the way putting the foot down with confidence makes the car way faster and an insane number of overtakes during each race, however this movie pushes it way further into cringe than many before it (for reference, I Pixar's 'Cars' does it better).Anybody with a basic knowledge of motorsport will find this a reckless waste of opportunity as the writers have lazily prioritised an audience of 10 year old gamers and their parents for a story of 'underdog gamers vs the world' rather than celebrating the amazing real story it's based on with the true intensity and drama of the sport. Many characters are ridiculous (such as how all mechanics and drivers seem to hate the so called 'sim drivers') and much of the dialogue had me laughing at the inconsistency. Key events such as the brakes 'glazing', getting rammed off the road to lose the race (he got criticised by his team!?!) and the car backflipping (due to low fuel and tyres??!?) just make this film so stupid. Had the flipping car been addressed as dirty air from the car infront or a wrong aero setup, the movie may have come off as slick, educating and intense. However, this is just a few of a million missed opportunities where a motorsport professional should have been consulted to help with the script/story. Rather than educate, this film gives kids the impression the real world of racing is like Gran Turismo, just turn up with no preparation and push the pedal harder than everyone else and you win. Absolute garbage.If you are not an insecure gamer or have a respect for sport, do not expect a good film here. This is an advertisement for Nissan and Gran Turismo without logic. It is a truly wasted opportunity to connect a great story with a great game franchise and showcase the intensity of gt and endurance series motorsport. 1.5 stars because at least it had cars going fast and real track names.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","stevendbeard","12 August 2023","I saw Gran Turismo, starring David Harbour-Stranger Things_tv, Black Widow; Orlando Bloom-Carnival Row_tv, Black Hawk Down; Djimon Hounsou-the Shazam! Movies, Guardians of the Galaxy and Archie Madekwe-Midsommar, Teen Spirit.This movie is based on a true story about a video game player named Jann Mardenborough that was able to fulfill his life's dream. Archie plays Jann, a teenage kid that always loved cars and so, of course, he plays a video game called Gran Turismo every spare moment he has-it's a video game about racing. Orlando plays a marketing guy that works for Nissan and comes up with an idea about having a contest to find the best video gamer and put them behind the wheel of a real race car and have them race against professionals. When Archie wins the contest, his father, Djimon, disapproves and thinks his son should get a real job. Archie decides to go for it anyway, since it is his life dream, and David plays the trainer that is supposed to get Archie into shape, so that he might at least finish the race-David doesn't believe any of the kids can pass mustard against professionals-and I must give David props for his taste in music; he loves Black Sabbath. The racing scenes are pretty good-the real Jann Mardenborough was the stunt driver double for Archie-and there are ups and downs as far as the racing story goes, with lots of challenges . At the end, they show the real Jann and tell you his statistics.It's rated PG-13 for intense action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.If you are interested in the subject-it is an interesting story-it would be a good one to stream.","10/10"

"Gran Turismo","BoBo_Goal32","13 October 2023","It is not so easy to produce a proper sports drama film. Not all the stories are sexy enough and screen writers find themselves adding and changing the plot, in order that the story will move in an easier way to the big screen.This one is not a movie about the Gran Turismo Game - so gamers should take a pause before watching it. It is, though, a movie about a young guy who excelled at this video simulator so much he became an actual driver.This is the shell of the actual story which happened and as in a lot of other ""based on a true story"" cases, the film and its maker - Neill Blomkamp takes his artistic freedom to use other ways to tell it, in order that the audience will not fall to sleep after the first act.This one has a lot of advantages, but a high and glass ceiling, which it cannot break, as a part of a demanding genre, which only great stories or huge and talented cast could create a better environment to succeed.The story runs in a very regular manner and tells exactly what you think it would tell. Neill Blomkamp doesn't screw it up and returns after a small break from creating good movies to set a higher bar for his followers.Bloom and Harbour are great in this one and Archie Madekwe is a great surprise. Djimon Hounsou is also here and even Geri Halliwell (once Ginger Spice and today just Geri Horner) is almost unrecognized for a couple of minutes.Blomkamp film doesn't care from small characters or little plots (like the romantic story) and still manages to navigate successfully for a little bit than over two hours. If you are a fan of racing or this racing simulator - it is a must for you. The rest and even sports drama fans can see, but not as a must. Really fun time for every one who is not a big fan.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","blatherskitenoir","25 August 2023","This is a pretty typical, feel-good, racing-champion-underdog movie. It's like it has a checklist of the standard tropes for such a movie and crosses them all off.It doesn't really push the video-gamer side of things, dwelling in that world briefly before turning into a straightforward racing flick. It's genuinely funny, it's feel-good, it's better put together than most films of it's type, and it targets your feels just enough to keep it real, but not so much that the impact lingers.The true standout here is David Harbour, playing the guerrillas chief engineer in charge of turning nerds into star athletes. He is the heart and soul of this film, and steals every scene he's in. He is so, so, so fun to watch. Watch it just for him.The perfect choice for when you want to cheer on an underdog coming out on top, without too much emotional investment.","10/10"

It is based on real-life events and condensing such a story into a movie is a commendable achievement by the director.As for games, especially video games, most of us grew up with them. Personally, I still dabble in them from time to time, and the main takeaway is the learning experience. Anyone who has spent time on a gaming console has likely encountered titles like Need for Speed and Gran Turismo. The latter, with its more realistic touch, stands out. Similarly, in the realm of movies, the Need for Speed film was a complete disaster. In contrast, the one I just watched left me thrilled, excited, and thoroughly entertained. Overall, it's a good recommended watch.","2/10"

However, leaving the theatre, I was invested into his story.Gran Turismo knows how to hit the viewer where it mattered. It pulled at our heartstrings, it gave us a character we were rooting for and it dramatized a true story without making it come off as cheesy or forced.We also had an amazing cast, with each actor providing some substance to the movie. While writing this, it is currently top 3 of the year, and I think that it'll remain high up until the end. Beautiful.","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","NS-movie-reviews","1 September 2023","First and foremost the cast of this movie was outstanding, top to bottom. I found myself absolutely head over heals for this story and those who played a part in it. What a totally, completely crazy idea this was. The energy everyone brings to the screen makes it feels as amazing as it really is.The action and racing were also outstanding. The intensity and adrenaline were palpable throughout the whole movie. Heart pounding moment after heart pounding moment.There were some elements that felt a bit lacking, like virtually no training and practice scenes once Jann becomes a real racer. He just hops from race to race, and while there are some flashes of the physical training, there is no real proof on the screen of him training racing, just actually competing. It sort of gives the feel that all of this naturally occurs to him. It would've been nice to see drills and practice laps, things like that mixed in. A big deal is also made about how he's less media presentable than other people at the camp but we never see him work on that aspect of things, either. Just some minor details missing that would've made this movie feel like a total 10/10.GREAT job to all involved! This movie deserves a lot more attention and hype. It was really something fun and heartfelt to behold!!","9/10"

"Gran Turismo","TheDanishMovie-Nerd","26 August 2023","Neil Blomkamp, a name synonymous with the sci-fi realm, has taken an audacious leap into the world of high-octane racing with ""Gran Turismo."" The transition from interstellar exploration to revving engines might seem vast, but Blomkamp's ability to ground fantastical elements in palpable reality serves him well here.The film boasts an impressive ensemble: Orlando Bloom, David Harbour, and Djimon Hounsou. While these are undoubtedly household names, it is Archie Madekwe, the fresh face amidst the veterans, who emerges as the unexpected show-stealer. His portrayal is both raw and nuanced, showing promise of a burgeoning talent ready to take Hollywood by storm.However, the movie stumbles with Orlando Bloom's performance. Despite his usually reliable prowess as an actor, Bloom disappoints with an over-the-top portrayal rife with caricature-like line deliveries. His character, which plays a significant role across all three acts, feels unfortunately two-dimensional, lacking the depth and complexity one might expect from such a pivotal figure in the narrative.Setting expectations at bay, I approached this movie hoping for something divergent from the typical racing tropes, and ""Gran Turismo"" largely delivers. Its primary flaw, besides Bloom's lackluster performance, lies in its initial pacing. The first act ambles, often feeling more like an extended prologue than an integral part of the narrative. By trimming this section, the film could've ushered viewers more quickly into the crux of its story.Madekwe and Harbour's on-screen camaraderie is a standout. Their rapport is palpable, weaving a subplot of mentorship, rivalry, and shared passion. This interpersonal drama ensures the film is more than just about cars-it's about the drivers behind the wheel and the relationships forged in the furnace of competition.When it comes to the race sequences, Blomkamp is in his element. There's a visceral realism to every drift and overtake. Integrating visual elements from the famed PlayStation simulator, he crafts racing scenes that aren't just spectacles, but narrative tools. This unique visual blend, a convergence of gaming and cinema, can likely be attributed to Blomkamp's background in marrying practicality with the fantastic in his sci-fi epics.The film's soundscape deserves a nod too. The roar of engines, the screech of tires, and the ambient sounds of racing arenas envelop the viewer, creating an immersive experience.In summary, while ""Gran Turismo"" has its flaws, particularly in Bloom's portrayal, it remains a notable experiment by Neil Blomkamp. With exhilarating race sequences, a breakthrough performance by Madekwe, and a unique visual style, ""Gran Turismo"" is a cinematic ride worth embarking on for fans of racing and drama alike.","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","sjo-15","30 August 2023","I really enjoyed this.Some of the reviews I read seemed to miss the point and not get it at all, citing too much of a mention of the game, an over powering sales reel at the beginning, too many shots of the game, etc.Its a game called Gran Turismo about a Gran Turismo player who plats lots of Gran Turismo who wins a Gran Turismo competition to go to the Gran Turismo academy to enter a competition the be a real car driver to prove that Gran Turismo players are good at driving. How one would convey that story without lots of mention of Gran Turismo, gaming, and more Gran Turismo is beyond me.I was really drawn into the story line and found it quite emotional.Its cliched. It has a failed driver, a cut throat commercial guy, a struggle against parents, last chance saloon, against all the odds - its all there as if from a manual. But its done well. It does what it says it does.Orlando Bloom is in cruise control. David Harbour's character is unlikeable. But somehow it works.Interesting that the film makers, having set the film in Cardiff, Wales, have given everyone in that location a middle class southern / greater London accent. Not one Welsh accent is shown, yet other nationalities all have an attempt at some sort of applicable accent.Anyway, relax, enjoy the ride.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","TomTalksFilms","9 August 2023","It's fair to say that over the years video game to film adaptions have been more misses than hits. That being said this year we've had Super Mario Bros and Dungeon's & Dragons both of which were brilliant in my opinion.I'm happy to say that for me this is yet another enjoyable if yet unoriginal addition to the video game to film adaptation genre.Gran Turismo is the true story of how young Welshman Yann Mardenborough went from being one of the best Gran Turismo players to being a professional race car driver. We initially follow Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) who works as a marketing executive at Nissan and has an idea to try and market their cars towards a younger age demographic by opening a competition where by the best Gran Turismo players in the world get to compete for a chance to race professionally. This is when we go back to Yann who to his dad is a bit of a disappointment really. His dad played by Djimon Hounsou sees Yann playing Gran Turismo all the time and seems him as lazy and lacking ambition and as a result spends more time with his brother who is actively trying to become a footballer.The film then chronicles Yanns journey and what the film gave me most was a real sense of the pressure that was on this young man's shoulders at just 19 years of age. Every time he seems to deal with one problem another seems to be not far behind and by the end of the film you can't say he didn't earn his inevitable rewards. The film also does a great job of putting the viewer in the cockpit of these powerful cars and makes you feel and hear their power which only adds to the intensity when again Yann was only 19 at the time and behind the wheel of such powerful machines. The number one thing this film had to get right was the racing and director Neil Blomkamp does a great job of balancing both the real life racing experience and the video game experience into one film.As much as Archie Madekwe is brilliant as Yann, the stand out character/actor in this film is without a doubt David Harbour as Jack Salter Yanns trainer. For a start his character is the best written and over the course of the film his character really develops and without going too much into spoiler territory he starts to feel more like a dad than Yanns actual dad which in some ways isn't great as he ends up over shadowing that storyline. Jack and Yanns relationship is the heart of this film and David Harbour plays Jack almost effortlessly. Interestingly enough though after a quick Google it turns out the Jack Salter character didn't exist in real life and it's unclear who he is supposed to represent from Yanns actual story but read into that what you will.I can't recommend seeing this film on the big screen enough even if only for the incredible sound of those cars coming through the surround sound cinema speakers. It's an underdog story and one which you know the outcome of from the start but it's one that remains thoroughly enjoyable none the less.","4/10"
"Gran Turismo","netmedia-1","5 November 2023","The first thing you will notice about the movie is very specific aesthetics. It always looks as walking a thin line between a video game and reality. It has a certain emptiness to the aesthetics that makes it look one of a kind. However, Neill Blomkamp is not enough to make a good movie. The story is as basic as it can be, and it's one of those movie where some will say ""oh god this was amaaaazing"", and completely forget about it in a few days. When I say forget about it - I mean truly and sincerely forget, like they never watched it and most problably not remember any of the details.Also, it's the movie is a loooong ad for japanese cheapcars, and the only pure breed car the protagonist sat his bottom in, was 2 minute ride in a 911.","10/10"

"Gran Turismo","tlk914","26 September 2023","Overall, its a good movie,. It has some character building, it tells a fun inspirational story that is based on a real person, and it has a happy ending. A poor mans modern day version of Rocky.. The kid from the video game world (Rocky was from the tough streets of Philly) wins a tournament and gets a chance to drive real race cars. Aside from the ""he was a video gamer"" background, the script follows a dozen previous racing movies verbatim. Amazingly talented rookie unknown appears out of nowhere, gets paired with a gruff veteran with personal baggage, has a big crash that shakes him, but in the end comes back and wins the big race! See DAYS OF THUNDER and change the names.This semi-true story did sorta happen though. Not quite the way it was shown. Jann Mardenborogh was not the 1st ever winner of Nissan Academys online tournament. He didnt actually arrive till year 4 and 3 other ""winners"" with less dramatic stories preceded him. (It wasnt the only racing academy in the world and not only gamers were there). Also, Jann Mardenborough did not win at Le Mans in a thrilling photo finish. His team 1 year finished 3rd in class. 3rd is a very respectable amazing achievement, Le Mans is the endurance trial of all racing, many cars and drivers fail to finish even in multiple attempts. But 3rd is not a photo finish victory as it was portrayed.But fact bending aside, the actors carry it off well, the racing is more video game feel portrayed than putting the audience in the seat of the car but considering their theme thats fine.Overall it was fun and inspiring and worth the watch.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","Hey_Harry","20 August 2023","Based on the real-life success story of Jann Mardenborough whose driving skills in the Gran Turismo video game series carried Jann over into the realm of professional auto racing, Blomkamp's ""Gran Turismo"" falls somewhere between being a video game adaptation and being a biographical film about the game itself. Interestingly, ""Gran Turismo"" has a few elements in common with Jon S. Baird's biographical ""Tetris"" film released earlier this year. Both are biographical movies which center around a particular video game but both films also come up with fairly creative ways to incorporate visuals from the games into the film's narrative and very successfully so. With that being said, Blomkamp's ""Gran Turismo"" contains plenty of fast-paced, intense car-racing along with an emotionally gripping story backed up by Blomkamp's top-notch directing. Highly recommended for Gran Turismo and professional car racing enthusiasts alike!","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","acdc_mp3","23 December 2023","I became familiar with Gran Turismo when I gave my son his PlayStation 1 back in 1998. A demo version of the game came with it. Even back then, the graphics were amazing well done and the whole vibe of the game was very realistic in the fact you had to learn the courses and lines you drove to maximize your performance. With the vastly improved gaming consoles, graphics and sounds, it stands to reason that the hand to eye and timing aspects of racing could translate to real racing. The main difference is the physical toll that actual driving takes on the human body. I have raced go-karts a long time ago and after driving 100 laps, you are sweaty and spent mass of humanity. I felt like I played 2 football games back to back when I got out of that cart.This movie was well written and performed without being sappy and predictable. The emotions displayed were heartfelt and realistic. This leads to my final portion of my review. Back in 1979 there was a movie called ""Breaking Away"" which entailed a young man who was obsessed with bicycle racing. All he wanted to do was race against his heroes the Cinzano Racing Team from Italy and when he does, it does not pan out well for him. To make matters worse, he is a townie in a snobby college town where he is looked down upon by the college types and his own father.Just like Breaking Away, Gran Turismo has a storyline of difficulty, self-doubt, pain, sorrow, excitement and a final race where the odds are against the hero.Anyone who has seen Breaking Away and Gran Turismo will know exactly what I mean when I say this was a great movie where you will be cheering at the end.See it.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","classicsoncall","20 December 2023","Who in their right mind would ever consider a gamer to actually get behind the wheel of a race car for real? Apparently, a Nissan marketing executive came up with that brainstorm, and well, I guess you could say the rest is history. Improbable as it might have been to pull off, teen Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) answered a call from the Nissan motor company to participate in an on-line simulated race and come out victorious among a field of ten other contestants. Then it was on to Tokyo for exhaustive training and a chance to crack the highly competitive field of auto racing. I liked David Harbour in this one, portraying a mechanic and former driver himself who was able to admit that his fear after crashing at Le Mans curtailed his own racing career. Attempting to instill the fear of God and the devil both into the minds of the potential drivers, Jack Salter (Harbour) was eventually won over by the tenacity and competitive spirit of his young prot√©g√©. It's not all smooth sailing however; it took six qualifying races for Jann to make the cut, needing to finish no lower than fourth in a sanctioned race in order to get a professional license. A sensational crash on a German track almost derailed his dream, but for the foresight of Salter who forced him to face up to the setback and move forward. In the grand tradition of underdog sports films, this is another inspiring story in a milieu unfamiliar to most, but you don't have to be a race car fan to enjoy the spectacle. Just buckle up and take that exhilirating ride with jann Mardenborough as he achieves the impossible, never once making it look easy.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","CinemaSerf","25 August 2023","Archie Madekwe is quite good here as the gamer Jann Mardenborough who entered a competition devised by Nissan marketing man Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) to raise the profile of their sports cars in a league usually dominated by the likes of Porsche and Ferrari etc. There's a great degree of cynicism from the high-pressure, high-octane, industry that these glorified couch potatoes could ever make the grade, but with the help of slightly jaded but experienced coach Jack Salter (David Harbour) they decide to push these youngsters to their limits. What now ensues is based on fact, so we have little jeopardy to the ultimate denouement. That said, though, Neill Blomkamp manages to build the momentum well with some excellent action photography to get the adrenalin pumping. Neither Bloom nor Harbour are really here nor there, but the young Madekwe does manage to exude some of the grit and determination of his ambitious, fiercely competitive, and dedicated persona and it's been quite a while since I heard the dulcets of Enya emanate from a big screen. It does take a little while to get out of neutral - maybe just a bit too much familial scene setting to justify the fees of Geri Horner and Djimon Hounsou but once we escape that, the thing picks up entreatingly and is quite a thrill a times to watch. Definitely better on a big screen.","3/10"
"Gran Turismo","jussipekkaturunen","28 August 2023","3 stars only because of David Harbour's performance. Otherwise, I don't know if you can call this piece even a movie. It's such an oddball. It's like sequence of 5-10 second moving picture clips without any kind of interesting connection between the clips. This picture misses everything what I would expect from a movie. Drama is flat as a pancake. Virtually all the characters, all the happenings in the movie are meaningless. Action scenes are really lousy. LeMans 66 is like a masterpiece compared to this. The movie just jumps all the time to different scenes and brings very little of information about the main character and how he is developing from zero to hero. And that should be the point of this movie. A zero to hero movie. But it's not that. It's totally uninteresting commercial movie.","4/10"

"Gran Turismo","Pjtaylor-96-138044","12 September 2023","I distinctly remember thinking, at one point or another during the first act of 'Gran Turismo (2023)', ""is this the worst thing I've ever seen?"". It's obviously not, of course, but the first movement really must be rough if it inspires that line of thinking. I specify ""first movement"" because, thankfully, the picture picks up the slack once the gamers finally start to become racers. Suddenly, what's a serviceable and often unbearably corporate (any time it tries to tie into the eponymous video game - err, racing simulator - in particular) affair is transformed into a thoroughly enjoyable rags-to-riches experience. The director's cited influences of 'Rocky (1976)' and 'Top Gun (1986)' are so obvious that the link has likely already be made in your mind before the credits have rolled. That isn't a bad thing, though, and the fact that the feature sticks to its formula so confidently is arguably the reason it works so well, as it doesn't need to worry about reinventing the wheel rather than doing the best it can with what is expected of it (though this is slightly ironic given the protagonist's tenuous relationship with the rigid racing line provided by the developers of the game he so covets). The racing sequences are generally exciting and suspenseful. Even if they pretty much all play out exactly as you anticipate, they somehow manage to get you on the edge of your seat before they plaster a smile on your face. A lot of the flick's success comes down to the genuinely great David Harbour, whose enthusiastic performance really anchors the often cheesy narrative and is just a blast to watch in general. Archie Madekwe puts in dependable, if fairly unremarkable, work as the protagonist - whose unbelievable yet (mostly) true real-life story provides the basis for the narrative - and Djimon Hounsou delivers the goods when it comes to his small yet significant role. Orlando Bloom is on another planet, somehow simultaneously providing both the best and worst performance in the entire affair; it's a treat whenever he turns up on screen. Ultimately, despite a weak first act and a slightly indulgent runtime, this is an entertaining and effective crowd-pleaser that does what you expect but does it surprisingly well. It's far more fun than it ought to be (and, indeed, than its overplayed trailers would suggest).","3/10"

The look, the production design, the acting, the dialogue, it's all like it's from another planet. If you watch Rush or Days of Thunder, you have characters, you have stakes, emotion, literally anything. This movie is so devoid of any soul, any core. I honestly can't believe how bad it is. I don't mind the commercial aspect of it, I could maybe even accept the anachronistic nature of it all, but this fails at every fundamental of movie making and several times I burst out laughing.

"Gran Turismo","movieman6-413-929510","11 August 2023","Gran Turismo is a new sports drama directed by District 9 and Elysium director Neill Blomkamp. The film is inspired by real events surrounding the Gran Turismo video game and a real car race played and driven by Jann Mardenborough.Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) has a passion for playing the video game Gran Turismo, which has made him one of the best thanks to his gaming experiences. The inventor and maker of the game tried to attract gamers to the real car racing sport with his game. After some challenges, Jann is invited to participate in real car racing on behalf of the game and car manufacturer Nissan.Nissan producer Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) and former racer Jack Salter (David Harbour) who now works as a mechanical engineer must train and prepare the gamers for real car racing. Nissan and other sponsors are trying to make their brands more popular and hope to eventually earn more. However, Jann tries to win more to show that he has also managed to make a career out of following his car racing passion, despite all the people who don't believe in this, such as his father Steve (Djimon Hounsou).With this film they show how video games can influence the lives of players later on. By playing a racing game, Jann Mardenborough later really got into car racing. Despite the fact that people who do not or hardly play games themselves usually have a poor image of people who do game, this film still shows the benefits of gaming. For example, gamers who play Cal of Duty could later join the army with real military training. Or people who play Just Dance could break through as provisional dancers.Neill Blomkamp managed to break through in the film world with his first two directorial works, but then lost some of his success. He seems to be making a comeback with this film, because he portrays the film well. Gamers who are familiar with the Gran Turismo games can also recognize some images and game tactics that they themselves have seen or used in the game before. Furthermore, he also shows the differences with how real racers and gamer racers can look at a race. In this way he also shows how the different parties compete in a race. Thus, this film is entertaining for fans of racing sports as well as the racing game.The story is unfortunately a bit less balanced. In addition to the real story, the screenwriters were also inspired by the films Rocky and Top Gun and tried to put the story on the same level. Unfortunately, they concentrate this film more on the racing game, sports and training, so that the family aspects are somewhat lost in the background. All the time you spend with Jann's family and friends sometimes seems a bit unnecessary. Jann actually has a better relationship with his trainer than with his father in the film, because the film brings out this bond more. The film actually wastes Djimon Hounsou's time and acting talent. The same thing happens with Geri Horner, the Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls, who plays Jann's mother. The best acting comes from the bond between Archie Madekwe and David Harbour, who play characters who come from different sides, but still try to achieve the same end result. Orlando Bloom also plays his role well, but his character cares a little more about financial success than Jann's real sport or health. The real Jann Mardenborough actually performs the stunts himself and also serves as a stuntman for Archie Madekwe. Fortunately, this change is not clearly reflected in the film.","4/10"
"Gran Turismo","v1gg3n","17 February 2024","As a long time fan of motorsports this movie is woefully bad and almost impossible to watch. I can understand someone not invested in real-life motorsports enjoying this film, but the amount of cringe I felt hearing the race engineer explaining to Jann how to drive Le Mans on lap 1 of the race as if he hadn't been there for a week doing practice sessions and qualifying for the race?! Let alone time in the simulator?! Made it incredibly difficult to suspend my disbelief. This is just one example. I love Blomkamp, but man I wish he'd done a bit more research before presenting this film to the public. Please take this review with a grain of salt, as I am sure you will find this movie enjoyable if you do not follow motorsports in real life.","9/10"

It carries superb everything, but the best ones are the flow & vibe, photography, camera works, race engine revving sounds and the near outstanding visual / computer effects.It is based on a true story and that makes it all the more outstanding. In all the cast's acting, I especially loved David Harbour's charismatic, intense play, while Orlando Bloom's one was only thinking about success at all costs, compromise and money-bringing fame. Special kudos to Djimon Hounsou who played the father realistically and with emotions and Archie Madekwe who portrayed Jann Mardenborough with softness, determination and wittiness.Before watching it, I didn't imagine Gran Turismo to be that good, intense and adrenaline pumping.

"Gran Turismo","04GreatFlick","20 August 2023","Great movie. Starts off a little slow. The narrative requires significant setup, which might feel a bit slow initially, but once it gains momentum, it becomes quite engaging. The storyline becomes highly enjoyable from that point onwards. The movie is sprinkled with numerous instances that pay homage to the game series, presenting various cleverly placed Easter eggs. Although uncertain whether this will be retained in the final version, the screening I attended included an awesome behind-the-scenes montage featuring the actual driver who serves as the inspiration for the movie. Visually, the film is captivating and avoids any semblance of goofiness or such. I believe this movie would truly shine in a premium format. The intricate sound mixes and effects present in the film would undoubtedly be elevated and enriched by the enhanced audio and visual quality of premium formats. David Harbour, Djimon Hounsou, and Orlando Bloom deliver outstanding performances in this film. Each of them brings a captivating intensity to their respective roles, infusing their characters with a remarkable depth that enriches the overall narrative. I really enjoyed this movie. Hoping to catch it again in a premium format. Good job Sony! Bringing a video game to movie is challenging and this was a great entry! Good Flick!","10/10"

"Gran Turismo","nscoby93","12 August 2023","I am very pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. While I anticipated the score, I would end up giving it. I didn't expect how good it would be.So I'll just start with how good it was. The story was good, the writing was solid, and the acting was solid with David Harbour, in my opinion, being the best in the film. The cinematography and sound design were great.But where this film shines is in its depictions of the video game and racing sequences and how they merge the video game racing with the actual racing. The camera angles for the races were great and very akin to camera angles you'd have in the game. Then, in certain sequences, they implement the games hud in the real life racing, which was great. I also must mention the PlayStation sounds they applied at certain moments in the film they were fun, and they made my friend and I giggle.Unfortunately though the film also suffers from a number of things. The story has some strong moments, but it also had moments of dullness. Such as the romantic interest subplot, which was whatever I felt it wasn't needed, some cliches like the other racers treating Jann like crap and he doesn't get respect until he proved himself. Some moments of dialogue were weird too and at times came off as weak writing. Finally, this actor who played Jann (Archie Madekwe) he never quite sold me on him. I don't think he's a bad actor. I just couldn't really connect with him like I did with David Harbour's character Jack, whom I think was the better written character.Nonetheless, the film had a fantastic third act, which made up for a lot of the things I didn't care for in the second. This was also the second film I've ever seen that depicted the 24-hour race of Le Mans. The other being Ford v Ferrari, which after watching this, I now want to watch that again. The whole race at Le Mans was shot fantastically and was exciting to watch on the big screen.Overall, I genuinely enjoyed this film. While I think it may be a little long, it entertains and depicts an inspirational true story of chasing your dreams.IMDb: 7/10

"Gran Turismo","TharsheyN","22 October 2023","Gran Turismo (2023) is based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough and roars onto the screen in a high-octane spectacle that's sure to rev up the hearts of racing enthusiasts and gamers around the world.The heart of the film lies in the world of simulator style gaming and it's possible transition to real world results like the Gran Turismo game to real life competitive racing, and it's a sight to behold. The story is beautifully woven around a talented young racer, Jann Mardenborough (played by Archie Madekwe), who takes you on a thrilling journey from the starting line to the finish. The intense rivalries, high-speed races, and the pulse-pounding action create a captivating narrative.The cast delivers outstanding performances. Archie Madekwe's portrayal of Jann Mardenborough, his struggles, and his triumphs on the racetrack feel genuine and emotionally charged. The supporting cast is littered with brand names like Orlando Bloom (Legolas from LOTR) who plays Danny Moore, David Harbour who plays Jack Salter and Jann's parents Leslie (Geri Halliwell) and Steve Mardenborough (Djimon Hounsou) also contributes massively to the success of the film, adding depth and realism to the story with their incredible performances.The visual and sound effects in Gran Turismo are nothing short of spectacular. The racing sequences are visually stunning and packed with adrenaline-pumping action. The roaring engines, screeching tires, and the overall atmosphere of the racing world are captured with remarkable precision, enhancing the film's impact. I for one also really liked the way the filmmakers blended the real world racing sequences with the game of Gran Turismo. Some may not like the blending of real world and game visuals but I think it worked out pretty good for them.Overall a 9/10 from me as Gran Turismo delivers a thrilling cinematic experience for car and racing enthusiasts, gamers and fans of Jann Mardenborough. The exceptional performances and adrenaline pumping races will have you at the edge of your seat for sure. Also did you know but Jann Mardenborough himself is the stunt double for Archie Madekwe who plays him in the film, so all the racing sequences you see are done by Jann Mardenborough himself. You'll want to buckle up and take this one for a spin, and it might just have you returning for another lap.","7/10"

Based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough, played by See's Archie Madekwe, a young Londoner obsessed w/the titular Playstation videogame soon gets the chance of a lifetime when Nissan, personified by a hungry PR rep essayed by Orlando Bloom, sponsors a contest to recruit gamers to drive honest to goodness cars. Soon enough youths from various parts of the world converge to train in real racecars under the tutelage of a once famous race car whisperer, played by David Harbour, who quickly dumps cold buckets of water on their hopes when he lets them know the contest is a survival of the fittest where only one racer can end up competing. Madekwe makes the grade but then has to finish in a particular slot in order to qualify for the remaining seasonal races which gets halted when his car crashes causing the death of a spectator. Will Madekwe man up for the final race & dispel the notion that he can't cut it? Coming from Neill Blomkamp (Elysium/Chappie) I was bit worried since his last foray was 2021's God awful Demonic (which I would forgive a bit since it was made during lockdown) but for what the film turned out to be it was much better than I expected as I got involved in our hero's plight w/his caring parents, Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou & Ginger Spice herself, Geri Halliwell, bringing in much gravitas to their scenes.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","rek425","25 August 2023","The movie is a battle between two groups of people, the protagonists who think that sim racing can teach you real racing, and the antagonists who think it can't.This is deeply confusing to anybody who knows anything about either. Real professional racing drivers have been relying on sim racing for training and practice for 20+ years now. Not only is sim racing helpful for real racing, it's an essential component, and everybody has known that for a long time. So basically, the point of the movie is a conflict that simply doesn't exist, and it's just going to confuse a lot of people.Second, the movie is full of situations that are so deeply unrealistic that the race cars might as well be turning into elephants while being driven on the track.Like when the team coach starts telling the driver about his on-track competition literally while the race is starting... as if they hadn't been studying the competition for days/weeks before the race.Or when the racing driver requests special permission to deviate from the ideal racing line, as if that isn't an integral part of competitive racing that happens several times per lap.Or when the racing driver's own teammates throw verbal jabs at him for only being a ""sim racer""... uhh, aren't they on the same team? Who would insult the driver you're RELYING ON to do well? It's so weird.This review might seem like a bunch of nitpicking by somebody who fancies himself an expert, but car racing is a popular thing and a lot of people know about it. Tens of millions of people play car racing simulators on game consoles, tens of millions of people watch ""Drive To Survive"" on Netflix, etc. Etc.

"Gran Turismo","steveinadelaide","20 August 2023","I recently had a surprising experience at the cinema. I saw Gran Turismo with low expectations, assuming it would be a typical teen movie focused on gaming. However, the film turned out to be a thrilling and engaging experience.Although Gran Turismo is based on a car racing game, the film focuses on the true story of Jann Mardenborough's early career. Mardenborough, a gamer, is given the opportunity to compete in the Nissan GT Academy, with the potential to transition into professional racing. The plot is captivating and kept me invested in the story from beginning to end.Archie Madekwe's portrayal of Mardenborough was convincing and demonstrated the character's passion and determination. The supporting cast was also strong, adding depth to the story. Neill Blomkamp's direction was excellent, capturing the excitement and intensity of car racing. The racing scenes were well done, with camera angles and editing highlighting the beauty and power of the race cars. The special effects were realistic and never distracting.The movie's editing was tight, and the story moved along at a brisk pace. The dialogue was well-written and believable, adding depth to the characters and the relationships between them. The movie touched on themes of determination and perseverance as Mardenborough overcomes obstacles to achieve his goal of becoming a professional racer.While Gran Turismo may not break new ground in the racing movie genre, it is a well-made and exciting film. Overall, I highly recommend Gran Turismo to those who enjoy racing movies or want to experience a thrilling film.","8/10"

Despite the concerns of turning a car racing game into a movie starring a former Spice Girl, I was pleasantly surprised by the end result. So, it exceeded my concerning low expectations. Firstly, they did a nice job of incorporating some of the game's specific graphics and sound effects into the movie. I also watched the original documentary of searching for the best gamer turned real life driver but had never learned how their potential careers turned out. This movie pieced that together a bit for me. There were some surprisingly solid emotional acting scenes without expecting anything of Al Pacino caliber, but it worked well. The racing scenes were entertaining but a discerning racing fan will spot how they turned an actual 24-Hour de Le Mans racing crash into a more glamorized version and the racing was a bit movie tweaked vs real life.

"Gran Turismo","bsqgmsyt","23 October 2023","It's often said that the magic of cinema lies in its ability to transport the audience into different worlds, realities, and emotions. Sadly, ""Gran Turismo"" seems to have missed that memo entirely. As a film adaptation of one of the most beloved video game franchises, one would expect a seamless blend of high-octane racing and compelling narrative. Instead, what we get is a poorly executed, cringeworthy attempt at storytelling that leaves the viewer wondering how it ever got the green light.Firstly, let's address the elephant in the room: the acting. To say it's subpar would be an understatement. The performances are so wooden, they make a plank look versatile. Characters lack depth and dimension, making it exceedingly hard for the audience to form any emotional connection. The actors seem almost as lost as the audience, unsure whether they're in a drama, an action flick, or an unintentional comedy.The dialogue doesn't help either. Clich√©d lines and awkward exchanges proliferate throughout the film, often inducing secondhand embarrassment. It's as if the script was stitched together last-minute without any thought for how human beings actually communicate. Conversations feel forced, serving only as a shaky bridge from one racing sequence to the next, making it all too evident that the film prioritizes style over substance.In conclusion, ""Gran Turismo"" is a misfire on many levels. From the lackluster acting to the cringe-inducing dialogue, the film is a lesson in how not to adapt a video game into a movie. It lacks the finesse, excitement, and engagement that both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike would expect. All in all, this is one ride you're better off skipping.","6/10"
"Gran Turismo","arungeorge13","5 October 2023","The entirety of Gran Turismo's first act is soulless. There's nothing you haven't seen before in the first 75-80 minutes, which basically goes through the motions. The product placement is clearly in your face, and it's only the supporting presence of David Harbour and Orlando Bloom, especially the former, that keeps it afloat. The arc (rise-setback-redemption) is one you'd see in pretty much every sports drama. Neill Blomkamp, who started off with an incredible District 9, with subsequent films fetching diminishing returns (emotionally, that is), is going through a redeeming arc of his own. His flair for stylized action is one that I personally love, and he uses it to great effect here. There's stuff here that GT enthusiasts will love, and of course, there's some that they'll shake their heads on.The cinematic hook of the film comes around the 80th minute, right when the setback aspect is in full swing. Luckily for the makers, it registers pretty damn well. While the writers have taken some creative liberties regarding the playout of some events in real life, it definitely molds the film into a better experience. Blomkamp chooses to end the film on an adrenaline-rushing, emotionally heavy high of sorts, preceded by a brilliant Le Mans set-piece. The gamer-to-racedriver transition is one that needs more discussions, at least on a platform like LB. Blomkamp is definitively a very stylistic director, and that can be both a boon and a curse. If the first act could've been less generic (from a writing perspective) and more moving (from an emotional perspective), I guess this would've been a complete winner. In its current form, it's still fairly enjoyable. Special shoutout to cinematographer Jacques Jouffret!","8/10"

-One of my favorite parts of the movie, Gran Turismo has the sound to bring the big racing circuit to life.-The full octane rush of the cars lights up the theater, sometimes too blazing levels, but in doing so the scenes comes to life in spades and makes it wonderful.-Meanwhile, the group is able to speak clearly, bringing their full vibe to the mix and not pulling any punches to give you the full impact of the victory this movie has.-And the fact that everything moves around so good... well, it again works super well for me and I quite enjoyed having everything crisp, clear, and executed so well as the cars go to work on the track.The Story:
-For the most part, the movie has got props for being based on a true story.-An engaging story about an odd situation and an incredible opportunity, it's got bites of the video game with a dramatic persona that blends well together to make a great presentation.-And it has elements that extend past racing with character development, romance, self-discovery, and more, offering a wonderful variety of things that I think people will really enjoy.-And it moves well with still allotting time to some key moments, helping to put it all in a nice package that was fun and easy to follow.-It holds a lot of depth, and the presentation really brings things together in a way that takes this story to a more fun element that is very fun and engaging. The three parts of the movie give you the whole ordeal with great transitions from opening training to the parts of the career.The Acting:
-A solid cast makes up this team, with performances that aren't stiff for the most part, but surprisingly fun and holding quality that far exceeds most movies in this genre.-Madekwe is a solid lead character, strong, emotional, and classy that feels very classy and yet approachable. He forms a solid lead with a direction to really shine and I quite enjoyed the character
-Bloom may not be slinging arrows and killing orcs, but the man knows how to take a role and sell it with might. His accent, his urgency, and his focus on being this complicated assistant establish some fun relationship dynamics I think works well.-And Harbour is the man with the plan, again, and quite worth the investment in this movie. He takes the comedy, the heart, and the tenson and blends it into a level reminiscent of Denzel Washington in Remember the Titans and makes for an amazing character to anchor everything together.-It's a crew that really comes together and unleashes a fantastic dynamic that had me invested, laughing, and really engaging with me in every minute of the film.The Racing Scenes:
-It's a movie about a racing game, and that means we need to see some cars flying at fast speeds in death defying turns.-You got it! Turismo's presentation is all about capturing the moment and it does it beautifully with the sound effect mentioned earlier.-But more than that, the movie's visuals help to make the movie shine even more.-The cars are beautiful, one part CGI with very polished looks and most of it legitimate cars racing with style, flair, and stunt drivers pulling the moves.-A dynamic camera work helps next to bring the race to life, finding the right moments to switch between in the cab and out to maximize the tension and excitement.-Throw in various angles to show the race and give you the play by play of every exciting move in the Turismo set up.-Add the interludes by the characters, with great mike work, engaging conversations, and bringing the full picture as they all work to establish the rivalry and you have a presentation that really sells the racing scenes.-And to be honest it's like the video game meets Ford Vs. Ferrari and it really works in terms of the spectacle and story, elevating the movie to a higher quality that I thoroughly enjoyed watching and feel adds a lot more variety to the racing movie.-All those qualities and enough of the racing parameters again gives you a great feel without bombarding you with just turning like a NASCAR race.DISLIKES:So Many Characters, So Little Time
-The movie is loaded with a lot of people who influenced the driver's life, and I had liked to have seen more given the star studded cast.-While the movie handles it's time very well, the movie is loaded with so many characters and talented actors that I wanted more of each of them and seeing more into what they did.-Like Ford Vs. Ferrari, so many people brought an impossible dream to life. So I would have liked to see the various pieces continue to click as the movie continued.-Harbour and Madekwe have this great set of moments that are perfect, but Bloom's part is kind of there, but not to the degree I had expected to see.-The romantic and family involvements also take a little more of a backseat than I had wanted, and hoped for a bit more of that adventure, alongside the friends he made as well.-Even the rivalry needed a tad more tuning up, adding a bit more establishment, dialogue, and flair that felt like it was there, but ended up in the shop and missing the final cut.The Story Is Very Similar:
-I get it is limited to real life events, but the movie has a lot of the Ford Vs. Ferrari feel once the second and third acts come to life.-While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it does take out the unique feel, even some of the racing venues the same presentation as the Oscar level film, so that might be a tad annoying for some reviewers.More Racing:
-Once more because of time, Gran Turismo takes the wheel and turns it into a couple of montages to cut corners.-This isn't as bad as some other films, bringing a few elements, Harbour's reactions, and a kicking soundtrack to the mix to help, thus still making it fun.-Yet, the movie could have had a little more time showing him some moves in these scenes, seeing him improve and having a little more dialogue after some of the big moments to really spice it up.-The final event itself has a lot of things thrown together, and though the last part is astounding, the movie again misses some moments and dramatic additions that could have really taken it to the high levels.-That finesse and finish would have matched some of the higher tier reviews, but still not bad at all.The VERDICT:
Gran Turismo may be another video game movie, but to my surprise, this may be one of the best adaptations I have seen in a very long time between two media. It has acting that is amazing, with a strong cast to bring the words and events to life and keep you engaged far past a racing movie. The movie does a nice job of bringing the drama and other facets of life into the mix to create an engaging character, balancing out this amazing man's life beyond what he can do behind a wheel. But as this is a racing game movie, the racing components are indeed the heart of this movie and Hollywood has done well to immerse you into the film. Great sound effects that shake the theater, a fantastic recreation of the races with awesome stunt driving and CGI mixed beautifully, and dynamic filming that rings out just how good a movie like this can be. It's really a wonderful ride that a theater visit is totally worth. And yet, this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea. A similar story to an even bigger hit, the movie sort of pulls punches when it comes to the characters, racing development, and dynamics that help elevate these pieces. Had it not been for a time crunch, I feel we could have sped away from the generic pace, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, just something those looking for more unique factor would look for. Still, I recommend this movie and really found it to be one of the better surprises that cracked my top 10 for the year. My scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","PerryAtTheMovies","10 August 2023","8.1/10Super early screening of ""Gran Turismo"" that I only just found out about last night so I had to take advantage. Absolutely amazing film! I've never been a fan of the video game because I suck at it, but seeing someone who's actually fantastic at the game succeed and excel was phenomenal to see. I'm also not a car guy, but that doesn't matter to enjoy this one.I'll be looking up the story after this review so right now I don't know how true, or embellished, the story is, but obviously this guy has made a name for himself in the motorsport world as is shown between the movies ending and the credits.The visuals for this film are outstanding. They did a great job bringing you into the car, and giving a good illusion of being in the drivers seat. The sound was incredible as if you were part of the action. Emotionally you're drawn and pushed out. My heart was racing so much through the entirety. I figured the story had a good ending otherwise why create such a film, but not knowing how the end result is achieved was nerve wracking. It's been awhile since a film has made me this emotional and passionate.A few downsides are continuity errors, some visuals not feeling real or graphical, and time slowing down too much thus causing some distraction to take place, but overall I think this is a must see in theatres. It has character, quality, emotional impact, and a well-rounded storyline. It feels real.That's all for now. Thank you for reading my review, and until next time.... Enjoy the show!","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","martimusross","6 November 2023","Gran TurismoAlways challenging to turn a game or a competition into a gripping movie, but we have quite a few of these now and the genre gets better and better, the secret it seems is to make sure it interests the none gamers in the audience.We had a really strong central story (supposedly almost true) delivered by Archie Madekwe who played Jann. He did a persuasive job as the driven teen, it wasn't Shakespeare, but I was cheering for him.They shoved some real acting talent into this movie and that decision really paid off in spades. It was acting gold from David Harbour and Orlando Bloom and it was great to see Ginger Spice.I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10, it was well worth a watch.","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","RightOnDaddio","28 August 2023","Last year on the first National Cinema Day, I saw the Orphan movie sequel, Orphan: First Kill. This year, it was Gran Turismo.This is the best racing movie since Days of Thunder and Talledega Nights.I'm serious.I don't even care that it's a video game. I didn't even know it was a video game.It's like the race cars in the film. It's fast. Sleek. Stylish and cool.The last race car video game I remember was Pole Position.It's got a stellar cast all snug perfectly in their parts. Orlando Bloom, Djimon. Hounsou, David Harbour and Ginger Spice as one of the hottest moms ever in cinema.Also directed by Neill Blomkamp. This is his best film since District 9. And I loved District 9.I winced when I saw the run time of this movie.Two hours and fifteen minutes for a movie about a video game?Does not anybody have any restraint in the film industry anymore?But, I can report here from the pits that it goes quickly. A lap or two around the track is all.It's got an inspiring story, a sweet little love story, and lots and lots of high speed race and chase, paint-swapping action.I loved it.In the end, you'll want a sporty Nissan, and to follow this particular brand of motor car racing.And you'll want some champagne.Make that a beer.Champagne is for the podium.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","Elvis-Del-Valle","29 August 2023","Based on a PlayStation video game, Gran Turismo does not go to the trouble of being a video game adaptation just like that, but opts instead to be a biographical film of a gamer who just by playing Gran Turismo had the opportunity to fulfill his dream of be a racer and go far. When it seems that playing video games is nothing more than a waste of time, the story that this film tells shows the opposite and that in the end being a gamer does have a job opportunity. It is a very good dramatic story about how, sometimes by luck or by fate, an opportunity to reach a dream that at first seemed to be impossible presents itself. The whole film shows us this journey that Jann had to undertake in his goal as a future car racer. The movie is very easy to follow and has emotional moments that manage to connect with Jann and his trainer Jack. The race car sequences are very good and build excitement as Jann competes for his new calling. Gran Turismo is definitely one of the best sports and biographical movies ever made and is somewhat unique among many movies that have been made based on video games. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","Amanda2021","30 December 2023","Our entire family liked which includes a 12 and 16 year old, me and my husband. It is an inspirational story. He is from working class family has big dreams which seem impossible, against the odds kind of thing. Main character actor was very believable and likable. Made you want to root for him. Others did great too, 2nd racer was very believable in his cocky role. Had veteran actors Djimon Hounsou and Orlando Bloom, always great. Def add to lineup of inspirational sports movies, if you like the based on true story ones, you will like it. No vulgarity but some intensity with the racing, crashes and without spoiling just know there are a couple extreme moments, may need to talk with younger kids about but it is a dangerous sport. While my teens liked, I think younger or even older would like as well. First movie I have seen like this that involves young people from so many countries, I like that, and would enjoy more of them, especially because our world is already so interconnected. So thank you to the movie studios and game. Never heard of this until Netflix, which is a shame, would have been cool to see in theaters. Seems like they need to market movies more equally.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","vithiet","12 November 2023","When I first heard about it I really thought it would be some terrible videogame Fast & Furious flop. Then I got intrigued by the high ratings but still thought it might be a decent action movie relying heavily on the game lore in a way that would make fans of the game rate is higher than it should be. So I went in with a good dose of skepticism... and boy was I wrong. This is a fantastic movie, regardless of its source material. The writing is excellent, acting absolutely on point, and the directing is brilliant with of course fantastic racing scenes. This is an absolute win that came out of nowhere for me and I highly recommend it.","9/10"

"Gran Turismo","kjproulx","5 September 2023","Everything about this film is interesting to me. The fact that it's based on a true story, while being a film based around a video game, and it's actually very good? Colour me surprised. I had no recollection of this true story ever happening, so the entire film was fresh for me. Sure, it's a little cliched and streamlined, but I can usually give all of that a pass when it's a true story and well-made. Here are the reasons I thoroughly enjoyed Gran Turismo.Revolving around Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), Gran Turismo tells the story of how he is ridiculed by his family for playing Gran Turismo on his Playstation console with all of his free time. With hopes of becoming a real driver, he is given the opportunity to qualify for a contest being put on by Nissan. After qualifying, his dreams of becoming a real racer and racing with the best drivers in the world quickly become a reality. Coached by Jack Salter (David Harbour), who believes none of these players can compete in a real race adds a level realism (and humour) as well.From being compelling on a narrative and emotional level (I even teared up multiple times), to being absolutely thrilling throughout each and every racing sequence, and being well-directed by Neil Blomkamp, I didn't have many complaints here. I was actually very pleased to see Blomkamp directing his first truly great film since District 9 (in my opinion). My only gripes are the fact that it may feel slightly long at times and the fact that it plays out in a formulaic way, but it's still great. If formulaic bothers you even if something is well put together, then that's really the only reason I wouldn't recommend this film to you.Gran Turismo packs emotional punches and gives you a very satifying conclusion as well. David Harbour is the standout for me (as always), as the burnout driver who coaches these young adults. His charisma here and chemistry with Archie Madekwe was fantastic. I was engaged and enjoying this film from start to finish and I highly recommend checking it out. At its core, it's a father/son story and that aspect sold the movie on top of all the other elements I liked. It's just a very good time at the movies.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","tharushazees","6 October 2023","To be Honest, I was liking the movie until the last race...
I can understand why they changed the timeline with N√ºrburgring crash.But Le Mans is a different case.To context Le mans is the most prestigious race in history.And to say that a LMP2 (which is not top class) Nissan broke the absolute lap record of Le Mans is utterly outrageous.And the audacity to use the exact lap time originally set by Kamui Kobayashi with TOYOTA (rival of Nissan) is just unbelievable.There's a limit you should never cross when altering History. And this film clearly didn't respect History or other manufacturers.As a Racing Fan it's hurtful to see.","6/10"
"Gran Turismo","chand-suhas","6 October 2023","Based on the real life of Jann Mardenborough who from being a random ofcourse very talented Gran Turismo player, earns his chance to be part of GT Academy and wins his way to become a professional racer. A once in a lifetime opportunity offered by Nissan along with chief engineer Jack Salter. It follows Jann's personal life and his initial days at the Academy prepping to become the profession racer, he is destined to be. Taking through the various championships and challenges he has to overcome to prove his worth at Le Mans.I have never played Gran Turismo or followed this story. It started off well, shedding light on Jann's personal life, introducing his parents and brother, his dynamic with his disapproving father till wins his ticket to GT Academy by winning the race in the video game, beating the several best. It got really interesting once the training episode started at the Academy, aided by ever dependable David Harbour as Jack Salter. There were stand out moments here to establish Jann's character as a natural.The film's pace drops once Jann's character gets his licence and the screenplay gets a bit repetitive. The real life crash experience is inserted here to amp up the drama and the slow pace just adds upto the runtime. The final act revolving around 24hr race at Le Mans is where the film picks up and it does offer few generic scenes here that are serviceable. Although the film never reaches the high which the initial hour had. Overall it was still a decent watch aided by good performances by Archie Madekwe as Jann Mardenborough, David Harbour and even Orlando Bloom as Danny Moore.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","Picturesinflow","15 October 2023","In Gran Turismo, we follow the story of Jahn Mardenborough (portrayed by Archie Madekwe), an enthusiastic player of Gran Turismo (the video game) whose dream is to one day race like the virtual champions. Luck smiles upon him when an intriguing opportunity presents itself. Danny Moore (portrayed by Orlando Bloom) has an idea to create a competition where gamers can race real cars, with the winner earning a chance to compete professionally. Enter Jack Salter (portrayed by David Harbour), a tough but ultimately benevolent coach tasked with training and moulding our competitors into their best selves. Gran Turismo is loosely based on the true story of John Mardenborough (although the extent of creative liberties for the big screen remains uncertain). Regardless, it's a tale filled with highs and lows and a heartfelt core, notably brought to life by Archie Madekwe and Djimon Hounsou.The only aspect that felt superfluous in this narrative was the love interest. It's not due to poor acting but because it serves the same thematic purpose as the family. The family, especially the father, plays a more effective role in emotional character development, rendering the romantic subplot unnecessary-a mere checkbox.First and foremost, I'm not particularly a car enthusiast. Gran Turismo likely holds even greater appeal for aficionados of the automotive world. Nevertheless, Gran Turismo successfully incorporates elements directly from the game, which, in turn, were inspired by our real world. A racing-focused film must deliver intense racing sequences, not just passable shots. Gran Turismo accomplishes this through cinematic shots with quick cuts, shifting to third-person perspectives, attaching GoPro cameras to various cars, and more. Each of these techniques effectively captures the essence of the game and is commendable. I must highlight the subtle touches, such as incorporating specific sound bites (from the PS5 menus) in certain scenes or replicating the list of racers exactly as it appears in the game. These are minor yet praiseworthy details.Regarding video game adaptations, Gran Turismo stands as another commendable example of what happens when the source material is respected rather than creating an entirely new story within a familiar setting. It may not claim awards or widespread recognition, but it tells a substantial story in a modest yet impactful way.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","MrDHWong","5 October 2023","""Gran Turismo"" is a sports drama film based on the series of racing video games for Sony PlayStation. Directed by Neill Blomkamp (""District 9"", ""Elysium"", Chappie"") and starring David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Archie Madekwe, it deviates from the usual video game film adaptation tropes to offer a fun, fast, feel-good story that always promises to entertain.After marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) convinces Nissan to establish the GT Academy, a competition intended to recruit proficient Gran Turismo players into real racing drivers, he sets out to find an appropriate coach for these potential candidates. Danny soon happens upon former driver Jack Salter (David Harbour), who is now working as a mechanic, and after some persuasion he reluctantly accepts the job to prepare the new trainees. Meanwhile, in Cardiff, Wales, teenager Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), a dedicated Gran Turismo player who dreams of becoming a real racer, sets a time record on an in-game track, which qualifies him for a place in the GT Academy. Upon arriving at the Academy training camp, Jann and the rest of the contestants are pushed to their very limits by Jack's intense coaching methods, which are intended to separate the weak from the strong. Jann eventually comes out on top and is promptly chosen by both Jack and Danny to represent Nissan in a series of races around the world.For more than a quarter of a century, the Gran Turismo series has remained one of Sony's most popular video game franchises for their PlayStation consoles, with over 90 million units sold worldwide. The racing simulator has built upon its reputation for the attention-to-detail regarding its realistic graphics, accurate physics engines, and the player's general freedom to fine tune and customise their vehicles to unique specifications, effectively proving the game's slogan as ""The Real Driving Simulator"". From 2008 to 2016, Sony and Nissan collaborated on the GT Academy as a way to allow skilled Gran Turismo players to fulfil their dreams of becoming real professional racers. One of the most notable contestants was Jann Mardenborough, who at the age of only 19 was one of the youngest participants in the competition's history. Jann's story is told to us in the 2023 film titled simply ""Gran Turismo"", which is sure to please not only fans of the game, but also newcomers who can appreciate some high-octane scenes of racing.Though the film is based primarily around a video game, try not to let that deter you too much. In actuality, this is a classic underdog story about a young man who defied the odds to become a racing legend in his own right, with the video game basis being little more than a plot element. Like most people his age, Jann is shown to be dreaming of bigger things far beyond where he is now. He is stuck in an unfulfilling job as a clerk in a clothes shop where his desire to race cars for a living can only be fantasised through the video game Gran Turismo. When the opportunity finally presents itself to him, Jann works tirelessly to ensure he is up for the task, even if that means going against his father's wishes. It is here we see Jann work his way up the creative ladder, putting to use the skills he acquired through thousands of hours of gameplay exploring every racing possibility and outcome. However, Jann soon learns he is not the only one who possesses these qualities, as he has strong competition from other similar players who are also vying for the chance at becoming fully fledged racers as well. In any other case, it would be easy to dismiss this film as another generic rags-to-riches tale but since this is actually based on true events, there is a more satisfying sense of enjoyment to be had as we watch things play out for Jann in the best way possible.Since this is a film about car racing, it would be safe to assume that it would have its fair share of thrilling race scenes, and this one certainly delivers on that front. Director Neill Blomkamp's creative use of quick-cut editing allows no room for boredom as we see cars whoosh past each other and constantly place themselves in dangerous positions where even the smallest mistake could result in death. It is here that Blomkamp reminds not only the contestants but the audience themselves that this is not a game but real life where the consequences of poor decision-making cannot be mitigated by simply resetting the console. As a result, these racing parts are considerably more exciting than what you might expect from a typical ""fast car"" movie, as these are essentially just young gamers who lack most of the real-world experience that actual professional race car drivers have been using for longer than most of them have been alive. I found myself highly invested in these scenes because there was a lot more at stake if something went wrong with one of these drivers, and the film does a decent enough job of developing these characters as people you feel like cheering for when things turn rough.Perhaps as a reminder to us that the film is based on a video game, there are some parts which I assume are there as a means to simulate the mindset of what the players are thinking as they are racing. For instance, in one scene we see Jann driving around in his father's car, which he stole when he snuck out to a party with his friends and is later pulled over by the police. As the adrenaline kicks in, Jann decides to make a run for it and drives off with the cops in hot pursuit. During this chase, Jann imagines the world around him as how it would be viewed in the Gran Turismo heads-up display (HUD), with the speedometer on the bottom corner and map indicators pointing him in the right direction to avoid being caught. Upon losing the persistent police, Jann envisions winning in-game trophies and unlocking achievements like ""Cop Avoidance"" for all his trouble. Although moments like this are intended to be played for laughs, they mostly come across as weird and unnecessary, similar to the first-person view scenes from the 2005 film adaptation of ""Doom"". With that said, there are only a small handful of these types of scenes so it's not too much of an issue.In his first leading role, Archie Madekwe does a nice enough job in the role of Jann, whose everyman persona makes him a likeable character to support throughout the story. Though there isn't too much depth to him, we are given just the right amount of information and backstory to Jann as a person for us to want him to succeed. He is passionate about car racing, he cares about his family and friends, and he is determined to get as far as possible in this competition even if it takes a toll on his mental health. I'm not entirely sure how accurate Madekwe's portrayal is compared to the real Jann but by movie standards he appears to be your typical underdog hero, along the lines of Rocky Balboa or Daniel LaRusso. To that effect, he is a character you'd be happy to see achieve his goal.Both David Harbour and Orlando Bloom were also nice additions to the cast as Jack and Danny, respectively, each contributing something interesting to the story. Jack is the film's strict but fair trainer, pushing the GT Academy's contenders past their limits to become better versions of themselves. Without giving away spoilers, we learn more about Jack's back story regarding why he no longer races, which is quite a tragic revelation. On the other hand, Danny is a savvy businessman who understands the potential of tapping into a particular demographic, in this case, gamers. He is the brains behind this whole operation, and someone willing to risk his entire reputation on a group of young gamers who may or may not have what it takes to prove themselves to the world. It's worth noting that Jack and Danny are in fact composite characters and aren't actually based on one particular person, likely due to either legal reasons or the numerous amount of people that were involved in this entire program.Whether you're a fan of the games or not, ""Gran Turismo"" manages to deliver a solid, visually stimulating experience that helps elevate it above the source material from which it is based. At its core, it is essentially just another story about an underdog overcoming adversity, but I believe that's really all it needs to be in the end. Besides, it's not like the original games had much of a plot to begin with, so I suppose compromises like this seem necessary. After all, who doesn't like to see a good old fashioned tale of success over hardship every now and then? I know I do.I rate it 8/10.","9/10"

This has a perfect mix of action, tense moments and a little bit of romantic scenes in between. The cinematography is spot on, especially in the driving scenes. I also love the soundtrack to this movie, this makes at least the top 10 of my favourite movies.

I don't even like racing or the video game but I definitely got into this movie and stayed in the entire ride (pun intended).

"Gran Turismo","andrewfeil","30 December 2023","This movie has everything you should want. A good plot that is even better knowing it's based off a true story, a thrilling experience filled with twists and turns!! Another great performance from David Harbour that will probably be overlooked by many. The rest of the cast did a nice job as well. I personally felt very connected to this movie as a gamer, to see what an unbelievable, fairytale experience Jann had to go from racing a simulation to a real race car. The visual effects annd visuals were very nicely done, where you could tell this was a major box-office film, and they put that amount of work into it. The soundtrack fits the movie perfectly. Even if you are not a gamer, if you have good movie taste, of action and being on the edge of your seat, this movie is for you!! I give the movie a 9.5 out of 10 stars!!","7/10"

If you can manage to see through the cliches and think of the actors as real people (a lot of real people would feel this average) then this is a great movie. This is the very typical underdog over-performing and scoring the towards the top.I do not care how cliche this is, this is universal, this is the typical lost cause coming back and surviving and winning despite all the odds. That can never, ever, be old or run of the mill boring. This is why we watch movies, this is why we want to escape reality. This movie is the very definition of escapism fun. If you do not like this you are dead inside.Yea, this is not 100% nor the best artistic film ever, but whooooo freeekiiiing caaaaares?I give this a generous 9/10. It is probably not that good. A real movie critique would probably give it a 7/10, but I could not care less. In an age of horribly bad movies where the art of entertainment has been lost, this is a magnificent piece of love aimed at the audience.Watch this and enjoy!","10/10"

So entertaining!I love that this movie was based on a true story too!Such an exhilarating sports movie.You get so inspired watching this movie. It gives you the positive energy to reflect on your own life. It gives you a message of NEVER EVER GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS. Truly an inspirational movie.Shows you that whatever you set your mind to, you can do it! If you just believe in yourself!The scenes between Jann and his dad are emotional and will 100% make you cry. Such beautiful scenes.Even if the lead star in this movie is Archie Madekwe, you see that David Harbour shines bright too! Both of them played their roles amazingly.I had no idea who Archie Madekwe was before this movie and I hope to see him in more movies in the future.100% I recommend you watch this, even if you aren't into car racing and stuff like this.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","georgegrimes","19 August 2023","Firstly I do not watch F1 motor racing or similar. Secondly I do not play computer games. However, I watched the trailer for 'Gran Turismo', and I was persuaded. From the outset, the film's narrative grips as the ordinary downbeat underdog is given an opportunity to satisfy his clear, single minded desire to become a star driver. The writing folds the elements succinctly into place as recognisable types of characters move throughout like pieces on a chessboard. Orlando Bloom is outstanding. David Harbour plays a traumatised individual well. Darren Barnett is excellent as a competitive upstart. Josha Stradowski was eminently dislikable as the nemesis. I did not warm to Archie Madekwe, but he was utterly convincing all the way through to the triumphant end. I knew nothing about car racing, but now I've been inspired to research more on this sport that previously would have me switch off.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","passamazonassessments","14 January 2024","I was expecting a 6 from this movie but I was blown away by how this true story was brought to life on the screen. I only regret not watching this on the big screen!It's not only a great racing movie but the acting, visuals and story telling are really good. It makes any modern Fast and Furious movie look very bad in comparison.I actually thought that the actors are placements, I didn't think that the depictions of them are as close to accurate as can be.The racing is suspenseful and made me tense up with anticipation, especially during the Le Man's race, which I was not expecting at all. It was like I was watching the suspenseful end of Loki Season 1 but for more than 30 minutes, I'm not sure how long the race was, that's how great it was. Now I don't like watching racing but this would get me into it.I never heard of this before but thank you Gran Turismo, Nissan, Danny Moore, Jack Salter (especially for making the right decision) as well as all cast and crew. Worth watching from the beginning to end. I guess only snobs who can find something wrong in anything marked this below a 7.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","bec-carter","6 August 2023","I played this game back in the early 00's so when I saw that this movie was being released I had a rush of nostalgia. That nostalgia is satiated by certain elements within the movie but it also doesn't rely on it.I took myself, my 18yo son and my 9yo nephew and all three of us left the cinema raving about it. Each of us bringing away something different yet each of us loving it for the same qualities. I will definitely be seeing it again in the cinema, my son is keen to play the game (which I'm sure is part of the marketing plan - and it worked) and my nephew states that it is easily in his ""top 10 favorite movies of all time"" which is actually quite impressive.It is definitely the kind of movie that has the ability to engage many different demographics.","5/10"

"Gran Turismo","iStej","18 January 2024","It's competently shot and the performances are passable. There is a script and the plot is easy enough to follow for anyone. Apparently that's enough to be considered a good movie in 2023.I don't think it's possible to write a more formulaic script than this. Beat for beat you get to see the hero rising, having a dark moment and finally triumphing. Throw in a watered down love interest and some mild antagonizing and that's a wrap.The character which we follow non stop throughout the entire film apparently has no personality. And whatever little he has, never evolves. He can best be described as stoic and that's very generous.For 2 hours we follow around this empty shell of a character as he goes through the motions of the most toothless and predictable script in recent memory.It's clear that this is targeted at a very young or simple minded audience that either hasn't come in contact with this stale film formula yet or is incapable of recognizing patterns.If you've watched more than a handful of movies in your life and can beat your dog at math, you should probably skip this one.","6/10"
"Gran Turismo","darkreignn","10 August 2023","I'll be honest - I didn't think I would enjoy ""Gran Turismo."" As someone who has never played the game, and as someone who isn't necessarily a fan of racing or of cars, I really thought I'd be bored out of my mind while watching this movie. I was wrong. With director Neill Blomkamp at the helm, ""Gran Turismo"" exudes a certain energy to it that is nothing less than infectious. With slick directing, fast-paced editing, and a booming, toe-tapping soundtrack, I found myself consistently entertained from beginning to end.""Gran Turismo"" is very reminiscent of ""Top Gun"" in as much as it's about a wanna-be elite athlete who undergoes extensive training to make his dream a reality, ultimately facing an ultimate test that pushes his skills to the absolute limit. And yes, even though this film is based on a true story, this is by no means the most original plot line out there at the moment. The thing is - at least for me, personally - underdog stories are always relentlessly entertaining; and in the case of ""Gran Turismo,"" the underdog story was filled with enough tension and intensity to keep me on the edge of my seat.Listen, you've seen this movie before.... but have you seen it conveyed with so much energy? Most likely not. Blomkamp directs this film in such a way that it never lets up - from the sheer charisma of the actors to the visceral thrills of the racing sequences, this is a movie that manages to hold attention, even if you're someone - such as myself - who has no interest in the subject matter. The movie moves at a breakneck pace, almost tailor-made to ensure viewers do not get bored; characters have fast-paced conversations and engage in fast-paced activities, and everything is wrapped around a directing and editing style that is also suitably fast-paced and boredom-resistant. The racing sequences, especially, are incredible to witness on the big screen and are 100% worth the price of admission (seriously, the crash scenes in and of themselves are a spectacle worth paying to see).Are there any negative qualities about this film? Well, of course. As seems to be the norm these days, there are many sequences of unrealistic and cringe-worthy dialogue - but, I mean, what else can you expect from a video game movie. Additionally, and I'm not one to frown upon a little love in my movies, but there are some scenes of romance that feel extremely forced and unrealistic. And finally, ""Gran Turismo"" is simply too long for its own good - by no means does this have to be an over two-hour long film; if this was 90 minutes, it would've been the most thrilling spectacle of the summer.All of that said, ""Gran Turismo"" is still a really fun time at the movies, and it's something that I'm considering going to see again due to the sheer entertainment value. I would highly recommend this movie, even if you're someone who doesn't care about cars or racing - as YouTube critic Jeremy Jahns said, this is a good time, no alcohol required (and take it from me - I didn't have a single sip of liquor, and I still managed to enjoy this film).","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","mumu420yhboi","12 August 2023","Whole film is very immersive
The game elements introduced in the film are amazing with the path lines on the track and the position of the car. Although the freeze frames for the position were overused and would suit better to have a smooth position indicator on top of the car during the race. The police chase at the start was a perfect display of game interpretation in real life.The acting was mediocre at the start but main cast overtook the show after David Harbour was introduced. The emotional scenes were great creating heartfelt moments.The cinematic of this film was beautifully shot, with drone shots during the races most impactful.The training montages could have been longer to emphasise on how hard it is to physically train to be in a real life race, the montages were short and uneventful.As well as this is based on a true story creates even more meaning behind the film, definitely recommend it!","8/10"

Great story, great cast, excellent soundtrack, usual Hollywood type Top Gun / Day of Thunder Story (like so many others), but what's not to like? This is what the cinema is build for, films like this all day long and why we must save the cinema forever.

"Gran Turismo","KFstudios2009","27 September 2023","Gran Turismo is a movie based on a true story. They brag so much about it, and I think that overall it was very interesting too watch it. It dragged me on, started a bit slow, but got absolutely amazing later, so my rating would be accurate to what I want to give. Car movies was never my type of movies, like Fast and Furious, or even the Disney Cars movies. But this one was very different, I got a lot of out it, and it was just so great. What made it great? First of all, the action. It was building up greatly, and when the car racing started, that was great. So many cool angles, repetitve, but I'm ok with that, I think it was cool too watch it anyway. Great, intense, camera-shoots of the wheels, characters, and racing track through the action sequence. The cars looked very good, and I'm amazed how many stunts this movie had. Planes, helicopters, racing cars, and much more! The racing tracks were greatly designed, great challenges for the drivers, and man! I got very entertained, long time ago I got so entertained by a sport movie. The acting was ok, average, Jann Mardenborough, preformed by Archie Madekwe, was the best one, he played the main character and played how he should be played, not much character development but in such movies it is not the most important. Orlando Bloom, that I had high expectations on, wasn't the strongest part, he was just kind of there, and didn't do much, so I can't say he was good, but I can't either say he was bad. Like I mentioned, the actors were average. If I have to tell somebody about a great car movie, I would recommend this one. Of course, it was high market pressure, Play Station and Nissan are big sponsors of this movie, so I get the idea that people would say this is more of a commercial, but I liked it. I think it was very entertaining, and very well done, and of course, you can do anything, if you want, and if you try. This movie can be a good movie for kids that want to do their dreams, and never give up.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","shelbymustang","2 September 2023","""Based on the unbelievable, inspiring true story of a team of underdogs"".Well, they did use some of the real life character's names and made up the rest. With so many good to excellent racing movies out there to draw inspiration from they chose to make a CGI cartoon along with a fantasy storyline that morphs the actual real life events.Am I being too harsh? I don't think so, I will not go into the details but it didn't take long for me to ferret out the real story from credible online sources.Take the racing movies 'Grand Prix', 'Le Mans', 'Driven', 'Rush' and 'Ford v Ferrari' all of which were produced in the $90M to $97M in 2023 dollar budget numbers.'Gran Turismo' is what you get for $60M.As I said...a cartoon, check out the percentages of the CGI used throughout.

"Gran Turismo","isaacsundaralingam","10 September 2023","For someone who has never been a fan of racing in any form to come to have enjoyed my theater-going experience during this movie is a recommendation of its own.Gran Turismo is competent in all the key areas, with an unsurprising but well structured plot, energetic racing sequences but with a slight twist, decent acting, characters, exposition, all of that and no major visible flaws to spoil.Now of course, it doesn't end up being as powerful as say, a Ford vs Ferrari, but it holds its own corner decently well and ends up being a fun time at the cinemas. I don't think it'll disappoint you in any significant way should you decide to go check it out!","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","invalid-03465","28 February 2024","Im a gear head, I love motorsports and I hated this movie.This is another classic underdog sports story movie, you know the type. Starring the total underdog with no support from anybody, the stereotypical trainer that was soo good but dropped out because of an incident and a sneeze ball manager, dirty fighting rivals and all that jazz. Totally blant.What makes these kind of movies interesting is their love for the sport. But this movie doesnt have any. Nor does it respect the sport, it feels more like a bad satire.The racing scenes are horrible, straight out of Fast and Furious. A Classic: MC is trailing a car, breathes in, SloMo, shifts down, pushes the pedal to the medal and cruises around the other car as if it was parking. Doesnt matter if in a corner or on a straight.Thats not how this works, thats not how any of this works!Or the movie brings up racing drivers going at it for a decade or longer. And these people intentionally crash into other people.Yeah no. Just no. Noone would let someone like that race. Or would be willing to race with them.The disrespect for the sport and its athletes, both for motorsports and sim racing, is unfuriating.So the script is trash and the racing is trash.But is it at least a well made movie?Also no.The editing is from Taken 3 with 30 cuts per second. The acting is meh but thats hard to tell with such boring and predictable figures.And if that all wasnt enough, this is a massive ad for Sony, Playstation, Gran Turismo and Nissan.At least the CGI was decent.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","MovieWarfare","27 October 2023","Gran Turismo is the next PlayStation IP to be adapted to the big screen. Their first attempt with Uncharted wasn't good but The Last of Us TV series was great. I was already interested in the idea of this movie but was further interested because of the director, Neill Blomkamp. He has not made anything as good as his first movie, District 9. Has Neill managed to return to form or is this another forgettable entry from him?Firstly, David Harbour is terrific in this movie as Jack Salter. He plays the old tough mentor to the main character and he plays it so well. David just delivers those powerful speeches with such weariness and charm. Orlando Bloom is also great in this film as the marketing executive at Nissan. Orlando gives a charismatic yet slight sliminess to his performance that is so fitting for a person in marketing. Djimon Hounsou is wonderful in the role of the Dad. He is playing a Dad who is disappointed in his son for just playing video games. A character like that would be very disliked by the audience but Djimon manages to make him very loving despite that. Djimon delivers the most emotional performance in this whole film despite his minimal screen time. Archie Madekwe plays the main character, Jann Mardenborough, and he does a good job. His performance is tame compared to the others and he is outshined. Still, his performance makes him feel more relatable which is a perfect fit for a gamer character.It's a solid telling of an underdog story. It has all the tropes you would expect: an underdog given a 1 million chance to make it, a grouchy mentor who warms up to the main character, the early success, the big setback in the later parts etc. However, it tells the story well and with a lot of heart. The dramatic and emotional moments still hit hard. A big core of this movie is the father and son dynamic between Jack and Jann. Seeing the relationship between the characters grow and the moments where Jack pushes Jann are superb. This is thanks to the great chemistry between David and Archie. The race scenes are also magnificent thanks to the great direction of Neill. He uses video game overlays to help the audience keep track of what place Jann is in a race. He also cuts away to the engine or the front seat to put the audience in the seat of the car. The climactic race is incredibly engaging and Neill does a great job in delivering a great conclusion.However, due to the fact it is telling a story you have seen a dozen over, nothing in the plot surprises you. There isn't any moment of subversion or surprises, which could be a bit disappointing. There are some problems in the story though. There is a love interest and romance element in this movie with a character called Audrey, whom Jann is in love with. The romance is not fleshed out at all with no exploration of Audrey's character. She doesn't even do anything in the story that is meaningful whatsoever. She is just there for the main character to kiss someone. I am also disappointed by the lack of Jann's dad in this movie. It feels like there should have been more interactions between Jann and his dad as it would have made the final scene between them have more impact. The movie is 2 hours long but even that feels too much for what is a generic story. The final race is very noticeable CGI and kind of ugly at times too.Overall, Gran Turismo is a surprisingly solid film. The trailers and marketing didn't do a good job of selling this. It's not going to blow you away but it's very enjoyable. Neill's is a great director who has made too many misses. Hopefully, this is the beginning of his return.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","Aziz24","9 August 2023","Synopsis: Jann Mardenborough is a gamer who enjoys playing Gran Turismo and with a passion for becoming a professional race driver one day. However, this simulator video game turns into reality.Going into this film knowing ZERO information about the very interesting and successful back story of Jann Mardenborough is one of the main reasons that might make anyone enjoy the story even more. A very interesting film that made me miss going to an IMAX theatre - the format that this film should be watched in - to watch a film about ""cars and racing"". However, the film is filled with mistakes and missing elements that simply make it a ""one-time watch"" type of film.Firstly, the star of this film is simply not Jann Mardenborough - who the WHOLE film is based on. It is actually Jack Salter who is played by David Harbour and that's simply because choosing Archie Madekee as Jan Mardenborough is simply not convincing to me. Unfortunately, the actor added nothing to the character nor made it special in any way.On the other hand, David Harbour returns in yet another role that is very similar to his role in the tv show Stranger Things (2016 - ?) and shares many elements with his character Jim Hopper in the show in terms of having that fatherhood and caring aspect in his character to take care of a young person. I guess it was a good thing and a bad thing in this film at the same time. Bad thing because he simply didn't present anything NEW. I felt like I was seeing the exact same relationship between Jim Hooper and Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) in this film that is between Jack Salter and Jann Mardenborough. Good thing because this is the ONLY good acting role and character in this whole film - thanks to David Harbour.The film touched very briefly and missed on a very major topic that should've been discovered and discussed more which is the relationship that Jann Mardenborough has with his family specifically with his father who is played by Djimon Hounsou. Despite having a very brief dramatic scene and limited screen time, he is mo than convincing, and the few brief scenes that he appeared in especially the one towards the end is very much convincing and touched the heart.Perhaps the film should've dedicated a little few sequences to Danny Moore's character and story about the different challenges and struggles he faced in terms of choosing a gamer to be the next best race driver from the video game simulator Gran Turismo, as turning this dream of gamers into reality is based on one of his marketing strategies to support Nissan which is shown in a very brief scene at the beginning of the film that is not enough. In addition, Orlando Bloom puts on a very great performance as Danny Moore which is a wasted card, unfortunately.Having Emelia Hartford as the love and romance aspect in this film can simply be described as a ""filler"". Very unnecessary and not needed.Perhaps the film's only card that could've truly benefited from is the cinematography which turned out to be a waste. The film relies heavily on the rule of thirds in the dialogue sequences which gets boring towards the end of the film for the ver use. Some of the shots should've been replaced with close-up shots, especially during tense sequences happening between two characters.However, the film mixes real-life racing and video games as the scene sometimes jumps between both at the same time to make it feel like a video game race in a real-life race. Very creative choice especially since the film revolves around that idea.Lastly, something that really surprised me that the film did not touch on is the backstory of how Jann Mardenborough truly fell in love with racing cars ad with the Gran Turismo video game, or how he gets his first video game console that made him get into this world. Perhaps a sequence that jumps back in the time when he was younger showing us that visually would've been better than just mentioning it briefly during a short scene.My rating is: 6.5/10

The right combinations of emotion, adrenaline, anticipation, determination, disappointment.... A true story that does not rely on over-the-top plot lines, action scenes, or acting.

Orlando Bloom comes across like this is a joke for him and has horrible acting and accent.I really enjoyed it for the story, but it did make a bit of a chore to get through with some of the Orlando story build up at the start as he is so bad. But as it becomes less about him and more about the two leads, the film gets better.Watch it if its on streaming, you will enjoy it as a whole, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it if I had to pay or had any positive pre expectations for it.","10/10"

"Gran Turismo","khalidmoubile","7 October 2023","Gran Turismo.Based on the unbelievable, inspiring true story of a team of underdogs - a struggling, working-class gamer, a failed former race car driver, and an idealistic motorsport exec - who risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world.I'm finally back to watching movies, through Gran Turismo that has to be one of thr best surprises of the year !Yes and for many reasons it is one of this year's best so far, the achievements in directing car races is the best I've ever seen besides it is kind of a video game movie adaptation and I don't think we love that type of films often.So, As I said directing was very powerful those taken shots from the back that feels like a gameplay were mind-blowing for me! I liked every race and the way they filmed them, I'm a big fan of that.I had some minor issues with the plot, somehow it felt unreal and I was shocked to know by the end that it is based on true story, but still the storytelling and dialogs were by far the weakest point in the movie.Finally, David Harbour was great and I wasn't expecting him to be that great honestly, his chemistry with Archie Madekwe was wonderful, and Archie did convince me that he's a introvert kind of gamer and he really fits the role but when it comes to his performance in emotional scenes, he couldn't deliver !","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","cylentmedia","17 December 2023","I haven't written a review for a movie in a while, but I felt compelled for this one. I thoroughly enjoyed it and the story telling in it was very thoughtful. Now I won't give it a 10 because it's obviously predictable but that's why it's impressive. They made a predictable story something I was interested in watching. The subtle ebb and flows, the story of his mentor guiding him through the process, it was a moving piece. Honestly my fianc√© was out of her seat pacing while the final race was occurring and genuinely excited for his victory. Overall just an entertaining and enjoyable movie. Definitely a need to watch movie for race car fans.","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","saimariejohnson","13 September 2023","This movie is nothing short of marvelous.If a marvel is what you are looking for - you will find it in the true story of visionary epic proportion unlike anything I've seen in theaters of late, and it is exactly what we need more of.The idea that a set of gamers playing in a simulated game couldn't clock enough racing time to compete did seem a little ironic to me with consideration to flight simulators being used in flight schools, simulators being used by NASA and astronauts, and also by military training installations - it seemed a bit unnatural to think that hours spent training in cars would be any different.Despite the absurd improbability, everything learned about a person's capacity to dream and conquer the world is delivered in the most heartwarming and strengthening ways.This was an absolutely great movie.","10/10"

I have failed miserably because I didn't give it my all, I didn't believe it was possible for me to achieve what I was dreaming of.This movie felt like it was about me and my own life.For the majority of my life I've been dreaming of achieving something that no one believed I was capable of doing. My parents never supported me, literally everyone told me that I was going to be a failure.Eventually I just gave in to them and started learning programming. Something that I'm not passionate about at all but pays really good money. I became a Software Developer since and I'm getting paid really well. But is that what matters? I don't know.This movie brought tears to my eyes at multiple instances. For me this was a one in a lifetime experience.The sound quality was insane and the stunning visuals were breathtaking.I watched it in IMAX and I strongly recommend that you do the same.","10/10"

I don't have the latest in the series but I regularly play GT Sport and also follow Super GT on YT, a gamer who has a bizarrely similar story to the main character from this cookie-cutter, predictable, uninteresting gear porn.They could have done so much more with this. I don't get why they chose to replay the same story we've seen before, with the same 'roll-your-eyes' clich√©s, all over again. Because it's safe? PlayStation is not in a position to be safe. And with the director they chose, they shouldn't have been. Now, everybody lost. We lost an interesting movie about a racing sim. A lot of people love. The director lost because he doesn't care about proving anything anymore. PS lost because they don't take risks.I really wanted to like it more.","4/10"
"Gran Turismo","aswinhanagal","13 August 2023","In fact see the user ratings on the same website, and also the Google reviews (96% liked the movie at the time of writing).This movie was on par, if not better than Ford Vs Ferrari. Among the best Motorsports movies that I've seen. Obviously there's a ton of brand placement, but that doesn't take away from the experience.My only real criticism of the movie is the lack of Gran Turismo music in it from artists like Daiki Kasho and also other famous GT music. The drama element in the movie was really well done, you can actually feel the emotions of the protagonist as well as the engineer. The way the races were shot was realistic and also the last 20 minutes was some of the best moments in motorsport film.Especially if you grew up with Gran Turismo, just watch it.","3/10"

But that was obviously not a goal anywhere on the priority list. Who is the target audience for this movie? Because motorsport racing fans, or Gran Turismo fans, are probably highly disappointed because of all the comical inaccurate depictions of races, physics, etc. The industry professionals that participated should also be disappointed they were apart of something that so badly represents the culture. Need For Speed, known for unrealistic game play, at least made a realistic movie.","8/10"

"Gran Turismo","RegalsReelView","15 August 2023","Jann Mardenborough has always dreamt of being a race car driver. The closest he ever got to a race car was in his simulation setup while playing Gran Turismo. Being one of the best players of the game, Jann was invited to compete for a spot in an academy that would train gamers into race car drivers. What seemed like an unlikely dream turned into reality, and Jann overcame the odds to become a member of Team Nissan.Based on actual events, and shows that if you try hard enough, even the most unlikely of dreams are possible. The film shares the history of the game's development, how the marketing plan was executed, and the journey of Jann from simulation driver to race car driver. The race scenes are executed with perfection. Fans of the game, race cars, and anyone interested in a story about a young person beating the odds to achieve a dream will enjoy this movie.","8/10"

My only reason to not rate it as a perfect movie, is because I wish the cast had resembled the actual people (at LEAST closer), other than that I have NO complaints. HIGH ENERGY! If you love racing, this movie is for you! The sound of the engines is amazing throughout the entire movie. It definitely feels long, but I didn't want the movie to end. I feel most great movies are longer than the average. Ending on such a high note leaving you feeling like you're in the celebration! I don't know much of the original story, so I hope this movie stuck to it closely. The acting was great, the scenes were great, overall a Great Movie! 9/10 Recommended.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","thechair","19 August 2023","Like a lot of people on here I had low expectations for this one, and perhaps that plays a fair part in how I feel about it but I absolutely loved it. If you've seen Days of Thunder then you've basically seen this as many of the beats are the same. That's no bad thing though! It isn't as glamorously shot as that Cruisemobile but it does bring a lot more heart with it, with a genuine underdog aspect ably played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, his rookie awkwardness on screen adding to the based-on-a-true-story feeling. David Harbour was excellent as his gruff engineer foil also.All of the above I was kind of expecting but what surprised me was how good the racing scenes were. I was completely wrapped up in each event, the editing and the sound design really ramping up the cinema experience - and I would definitely recommend that is where this is watched. I'll happily buy a 4K version when it comes out but this was designed for a big screen with blockbuster sound. I should caveat all of the above with the fact that I am very much an auto-sport fan, but I'm also pretty discerning about my movies. This one has made it to the podium (at least for the summer 'race'). Vroom Vroom.","1/10"
"Gran Turismo","twospies-67255","31 December 2023","If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. It's cut like a video game, super choppy and fast. Filmed like a bunch of commercials cut together. The first half is definitely one of the worst first halves of a movie I've ever seen. Cardboard characters. The actors are all phoning it in. So boring and predictable. Everyone seems super tired and weary to be in the movie. The plot is paint-by-numbers. Surprising, because I love all of the director's other movies.However, the 2nd half does get better. Better editing, more emotion and better character development.All that said, I'm 48 so if you're younger it's possible you have the short attention span most of the movie is tailored for. My kids ages 8 and 10 loved it.","10/10"

But this movie has made the impossible, it has killed the not existing interest in me for both of those things. How can anything kill two things that not exist, you may ask. Well, this statement doesn't make sense, right? Just as this movie.The script sucks, the acting is laughable, the SGI sucks, the dialogue sucks, the music sucks, the editing sucks, the cinematography is okay but I don't see anything, because the cutting is too fast. Oh, and did I mention ? The message of this movie is: ""If you don't have a PlayStation, (I mean you have to have one, because the average viewer of this movie clearly has one), buy Gran Turismo, lock yourself in the room, and be a car racer with watching a screen, because dreams can become true, only of course, if you buy them.""","5/10"

I'm not a big video game fan, or at least racing games, so I knew nothing of the game they played, but I was so drawn in.

"Gran Turismo","The_Second_Opinion","9 August 2023","I came into the movie without having played any of the Gran Turismo games, never having watched any car race, never having even driven a car. So, I'm perhaps not really the target audience.Or am I? Leaving the theatre, I couldn't help but feel I had just witnessed a 2 hours and some minutes long advertisement. For what, exactly, I'm not sure. Is it a Gran Turismo ad? That's what the movie makes you believe for the first 45 minutes, when the plot focuses on the main character's difficulties on making the transition from the bedroom to the circuit. However, passed the first hour the movie takes a turn (pun intended) towards the pro side of the car racing sport.So I thought it would be an F1 ad after all. There's a lot of race footage, slow motions and the like, and that's where most of the production money must have gone. But if that's the case then it does a terrible job, as I left the theatre more confused than ever about the car race sport, how it's played, why people find it interesting, what are the tactics, and how something so stupidly dangerous can even be allowed. (2 critical accidents are displayed on screen, but in both cases everyone seems to find it normal for drivers and spectators to risk their lives for a car race and no one ever discusses talking action to prevent accidents from happening again.)In the end, the movie isn't really about anything, not even about the hero's journey. There's an absurd lack of focus on Jann (main character)'s struggles in adapting to high-intensity training, we just see him training a bit in the gym, we see other people struggling, but not him because... plot. Later in the movie he drinks alcohol several times and goes to a club. So much for all the F1 fans trying to convince us that it's really a high intensity sport which requires lifestyle sacrifices.Jann's relationship with his entourage is equally confusing. At first his family doesn't support him and the coach doesn't see his potential. The girl he likes just happens to like him back as well, he doesn't even need to pursue her, but she believes in him and tries to offer him support. Finally the coach comes to realise his potential and tells him his story so he can overcome it and do better than him. The coach owns an old music player with only 8 songs but doesn't want to upgrade because of nostalgia, so Jann buys him a new iPod and tells him it's a lesson.This could have been the movie's message right here: that it's important to leave the past behind in order to form a new future. It's a simplistic and overused theme, but it's still better than no theme. Just as Jann would break ties with his biological family and get closer to his girlfriend, echoing Jann's dad mistake of remaining in the past by favourising his other son, the one who plays football like he did. Without giving away any spoilers, the film doesn't end up going that way; and when the credits roll, it's actually the coach's name on top of the list, a giveaway that, in the end, it was him, the main character of the story.","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","misskermit99","3 August 2023","I wish the movie was a tad longer to flesh out some scenes; hence my rating. As someone who grew up playing racers on PlayStation with my Mom and Siblings, this was like a blast to the past. I got to watch early due to AMC's Investor Connect showing. The atmosphere in the theater was great with everyone laughing and cheering together at the right moments.I love how they handled the love story; which was the only thing I was kind of worried about. With that I wish they would have spent some more time in Tokyo as the visuals were great. Speaking of visuals, man, seeing the car animations in the trailer didn't do it justice for the big screen. There weren't too many of them, and when on screen they were done so well.I did watch some interviews and behind the scenes videos before watching so I had some idea of the backstory on which the movie is based on. I'm not sure if the movie does a good job of introducing the story in a way that's easy to follow for those who aren't aware, as I missed the beginning due to outside forces (not included in my rating). So I will need to go back to watch it again, which I'm more than happy to.All in all; if you love racer games/sims, or even want to watch a great story on the big screen, I'd recommend this movie!","8/10"

I also saw The Hill the same day and ironically they have very similar themes. Young men pursuing their dreams and overcoming ridiculous odds without the support of their fathers.

Still, I found it riveting and loved the brisk action and feel good underdog story! It's predictably scripted but Neill Blomkamp's immersive direction really puts us in the drivers seat beside Jann. A crazy, unbelievable and inspiration true story of a gamer turned racer that wins you over with its charm, emotion and performances.A lot better than I expected, it's a great time at the movies! Likely Blomkamp's most accessible film, and his best outside of District 9!","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","djrmc24","15 October 2023","When I first watched the trailer and TV spots for Gran Turismo, I thought to myself this is going to be another failed misfire video game adaption. WOW! Was I completely wrong! Gran Turismo has a lot of heart with a lot of exhilarating racing scenes. What I like about the film is you can be a fan of the game or have never played it to enjoy this movie. The movie is also based off of a real life true story which I was unaware of prior to watching. The movie centers around a young guy who gets an opportunity to race professionally based off of how well he did in a video game. Yes, you read that rigth and it's all true. The movie also has a lot of heart and emotion to it which I was not expecting. If you love cars and racing movies you will enjoy this one. Right now Sony PlayStation Studios is on a roll with their video game adaptions. I wish this movie could have been a little shorter at 2 hours instead of being 2 hours plus. Gran Turismo gets 7 solid stars out of 10 from me.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","20 September 2023","Hey, Streamers! Videogames seem to be a hot commodity in the entertainment industry these days. However, they aren't always adapted into good movies or television shows. This year alone we've seen what HBO could do with The Last of Us and Illumination produced The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Here Gran Turismo focuses on a real-life story related to the game. Let's see whether this angle yields an entertaining movie.Apparently, Gran Turismo is based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe). Jann is such an avid player of the racing simulator ""Gran Turismo"" that he believes he can become a professional racer. Jann has uncanny skill and ability to be successful and fast in the simulator, but it is questionable whether those skills translate to the real world. Meanwhile, Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), a marketing executive at Nissan, comes up with a scheme to boost Nissan sales by creating a GT Academy aimed at players like Jann getting the opportunity to become professional racers. Moore enlists a former professional racer, Jack Salter (David Harbour), to train the new recruits and turn those that attend the GT Academy into legitimate racers. Fast cars and racing hijinks ensue.Gran Turismo is a fun sports movie that comes with many of the sports movie tropes. There is an underdog in Jann. There is the grizzled, washed-up coach in Salter. There are worried and dubious parents and evil villains that lurk on the racetrack. The mix of these elements make for an enjoyable experience. Since this movie is based on true events, we know from the outset how this underdog story will turn out, but nevertheless it is still pretty thrilling. The racing sequences are shot really well, which makes the big screen experience feel vital. There are zooming cameras, and there are high-flying drone shots that help the audience follow the action on the track. The movie is edited really well too. It feels like a lot happens in a short amount of time which allows the movie to hold your attention.On the performance side, David Harbour is a standout as usual. He plays that curmudgeonly figure really well, but he has a sensitive side that makes him endearing like his Stranger Things alter ego, Jim Hopper. Ultimately, Harbour is able to convey how much his character cares for Jann despite his initial skepticism. I'll also shout out Djimon Hounsou, who plays Jann's father, Steve. Hounsou's part isn't big, but it is pivotal in the emotional side of the story. He has a couple really great scenes that maybe are a little cliched, but they worked for me.Side note: Ginger Spice plays Jann's mom, but there are no Spice Girls songs?Ultimately, Gran Turismo delivers a great and entertaining sports movie. It is a crowd-pleaser and a triumphant, unlikely story. There are cool camera shots and the editing keeps the movie moving at a fast pace like the cars these guys are driving. Also, there are some touching emotional moments. Grab a box of popcorn and go for a spin with Gran Turismo.","6/10"
"Gran Turismo","hypestyle","6 September 2023","Gran Turismo is a motion picture about the coming together of three very different men. Millions of dollars are at stake and it all hinges on how well one of them plays a video game. Well, there's more to it than that but it's a good summary of what the pitch must have been.In essence, the plot concerns the real life Jann Mardenborough, a Black biracial young man in England. His skill at the PlayStation car racing video games brings him to the attention of a Sony Entertainment marketing executive who has convinced Nissan Automobiles to sponsor a Gran Turismo tournament-the winner gets to join a cohort of elite gamers in training to be real-life professional car drivers. This time, it's more than just neighborhood bragging rights at stake. It's the chance of a lifetime.This writer has no idea about the real Mr. Mardenborough or the rest of the principals in this film. So when it comes to the presented narrative, how much fidelity, if any, it has to the real backstory of this man is unknown. But as a general entertainment story, this is enjoyable. Because of this film's video game connections, possibly some non-gaming viewers will be taken out of the story with the recurring visual nods (starting with a police chase highlighted by ""you dodged 'em!"" graphics). That said, the more obvious computer-graphics are kept to a minimum, so viewers won't feel like they're watching a Twitch exhibition. (And for those who don't know what Twitch is, ah... carry on). Lead actor Archie Madekwe as gaming savant Jann is believable in his role as a college-aged console enthusiast, gifted but sullen. The rest of his supporting cast do a solid job, though their roles are pretty much thankless. Geri Halliwell, former Spice Girl, is unrecognizable here as Jann's unglamorous housewife mom. The estimable Djimon Honsou plays Jann's father, an ex-soccer pro-turned-railyard laborer. He has much less involvement in the plot than viewers may expect (he shows up to scold, to admonish, and eventually, to support), but he seemed to make the most of the scenes where he has a presence. David Harbour as Jann's coach seems to hit the expected notes as a grizzled, middle-aged former racing veteran with a tragedy in his past. Orlando Bloom is a welcome presence. His corporate hustler character is not villainous but not heroic, either: his ethical dubiousness comes to a zenith when he almost derails Jann's rise in favor of a more telegenic (and, yeah, Caucasian) candidate. Other supporting characters are seen in brief sketches, including the lady-friend and the villainous 'racing bro' on a rival team. The cinematography is excellent, it captures a lot of engaging real-life race-car action. For casual action movie fans and those looking for a general feel-good drama, this movie is well worth checking out.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","user-130-302188","13 August 2023","I must say that I am shocked when this film even managed to get above 6 for rating. The pacing is slow and story structure is very generic. The racing scenes should be the highlights of the film, but the way director shot them make them look like promotional ads of cars that are shown before the film. However, I must give kudos to David Harbour, who plays a frustrated mech engineer that doesn't believe players can be real racers at the beginning but later change his minds after building a bond with the protagonist. Harbour's performance feels emotional and sincere compared to other actors who are just there for cheques. Anyway, go see this film if you are bored or something, but don't hold high expectations for it.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","michvanbeek","11 August 2023","It has been quite a while since we were able to see a film by South African director Neill Blompkamp in the cinema. In 2015 that was the disappointing Chappie and since then Blomkamp has been linked to various projects, he came up with some shorts, but otherwise it remained silent. Now there is a project that you would not really expect from Blomkamp, who is really more fixated on the science fiction and horror genre. The story of Gran Turismo is inspired by the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo player turned professional racing driver. The cast is quite striking with David Harbour, who is of course known from Stranger Things as Jim Hopper, Orlando Bloom from Lord of the RIngs and Pirates of the Caribbean and Djimon Hounsou from Guardians of the Galaxy and Blood Diamond, for example. But ex Spice Girl Geri Horner, or how we know her as Geri Halliwell, we also see a role in the film. The relatively unknown actor Archie Madekwe, who played roles in Midsommar and Beau is Afraid, plays the role of Jann Mardenborough. It should therefore not be the fault of the cast and director and we look forward to the film with great curiosity.The film did not disappoint, because one always has to take into account that things are exaggerated or dramatized. The film opens quite slowly and you can question the ease with which Jann is put in the GT car. Basically, Jann narrowly wins at the GT Academy, and is immediately allowed to race with the pros untrained. Finishing a race in fourth place and you immediately get your professional license. It must have all gone that way, but it just felt rushed and easy. Of course Jann is not doing well, because he is pushed off the track several times and ends up in a nasty crash, something that, according to the real Jann Mardenborough, has been processed in detail in the film. This scene looks intense and Blomkamp has beautifully incorporated it into the film. But the switches between races, training sessions and Jann's private life and especially the relationship between Jann and his father snow under a bit. In the end, his father turns out to be very important to Jann, but this just doesn't come out well and could have been exposed a bit better.The last roughly 40 minutes are allocated to the 24 hours of LeMans. This is also the best part of the film, where perhaps the first half of Gran Turismo is quite hard. It's not that you're bored or anything, but maybe it could all have been a bit more compact. In addition, the film is a continuous Sony and Playstation commercial, something that eventually starts to irritate. Anyway, the LeMans race is very, very well done. At the beginning a car shoots out of the corner and explodes, this graphically could have been a bit better, especially considering the rest of the film. After that, switching from day to night and back to day is natural and this is well done. Still, the tension only really builds in the last minutes of the race. Because will Jann make it to the finish? Of course Jann eventually decides to drive his own course and the inexperienced racer does his own thing against Nissan's wishes. It will probably really be a bit of tension building and to end the movie as spectacularly as possible.Gran Turismo has become an entertaining film that perhaps could have been worked out a bit better here and there. The races look slick, but it is mainly the pieces from Jann Mardenborough's private life that are reviewed very quickly. It is precisely the extremely uninteresting passages from Jann's life that are shown too slowly. Also, the inexperience is handled a little too easily. It seems as if Jann is put in a GT car from behind his Playstation and the job is done for a while. Max Verstappen can pack if it all goes so easily, of course. On the other hand, I really have no experience or understanding of cars or car races, so you can tell me anything about that. Anyway, Gran Turismo has become a great film, which will not really bore you for the rest.","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","ykjdh","28 August 2023","Let me just say I had no intention of watching this movie. It was advertised as a two hour commercial for the video game it got its name from. However, it's based on a true story which is where advertisers went wrong. They should have focused on that aspect of the movie and not video game graphics. The story line is actually pretty good and effective as correlating positive emotions from past movies like the original Rocky where you're cheering for the underdog. That's what this is, an actual underdog story and not a commercial for PlayStation.The character Jann is real and this is his story with characters actually resembling his family in real life. He's also his characters stunt double in the racing scenes. I found myself rooting for this guy who's from a working class family trying to make a dream come true. Former spice girl Geri Halliwell and Dimon Houston are his parents who come around to support their son. Ignore the video game tie in like I did and you'll discover a very effective story that will have you cheering.","8/10"

I wasn't sure about a movie about that game. To my surprise, it was about a lot more than just that. The story is very compelling. And the fact that is based on a true story, made it mor so. The acting was very good. David Harbour was awesome. The fact that the real life Jann was the stunt double for the actor playing him was also very cool. The visuals are also very well done. Movies involving a video game can be hit or miss. I would definitely put this movie on the hit column.","2/10"

First half is going to be make or break for some people with the faux gaming lingo and themes but it's absolutely worth sticking out because it's a seriously good bit of watching.Has its clich√© characters etc but it works in the same way that Top Gun works in that there are so many good elements that you're not remotely bothered by some of the weaker punchlines.Hoping this pulls a sequel out in a few years and they can maybe pile some more budget towards the action racing scenes. I get it's based off of a game but having some proper practical effects and some real racing would bump this up to a 9 or 10 easily.","10/10"

RACING fans should not have to ignore the blatant inaccuracies in the RACING scenes of a RACING movie in order to enjoy it.The physics of the cgi cars (which are used a lot) make no sense. They handle nothing like real cars, the crashes are all over the place, the main character can press the throttle harder than the other drivers and drive nonsensical racing lines but still gain time. There are countless other examples of motorsport inaccuracies in this movie's action and dialogue.This kind of unrealistic representation of racing for dramatic effect works in dumb explosion movies like Fast and Furious and kid's movies like Cars, but I feel that it is immensely distracting from this movie that is supposed to tell an amazing story that actually happened. The producers of the movie either didnt consult people that drive and have experience with LMP and GT cars or just ignored their input and rushed the movie.Some people said that the CGI scenes are supposed to be a combination between the Gran Turismo game and real life. This is not a good excuse for the unrealistic cars and phisics since the movie portrays GT as the most realistic driving simulator ever. The CGI racing scenes would have even been more realistic if they would have been filmed in the actual Gran Turismo game.Movies can both tell a great story and have realistic racing action that does not deter from it (e.g. Ford v Ferrari, Rush, The World's Fastest Indian).If you are not a racing fan/driver and you can look past the very bad dialogue and the, at times, bad cinematography than this film can be enjoyable for you.However if you become passionate about racing after seeing this film or if you were already a motorsport enthusiast you should be able to see the huge flaws and inaccuracies within this movie.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","Mr-Topshotta","9 September 2023","Directed by Neil Blomkamp. A runtime of two hours and fourteen minutes. With a PG-13 rating. Based on a true story. Showing what originated from the popular PlayStation racing video game we all know and love today.""Jann Mardenborough"" played by Archie Madekwe always had a dream of being a race car driver. Ever since his dad ""Steve"" played Djimon Hounsou took him to see race cars at the age of five he had that itch.""Steve"" was a realist though. He never truly thought his son had a real opportunity for that life. If he had it his way ""Jann"" would follow in his footsteps as well as his younger brother ""Coby"" played by Daniel Puig playing soccer.""Jann's"" mom ""Leslie"" played by Geri Horner was usually the more supportive parent.Since ""Jann"" couldn't race he did the next best thing. He played the racing simulator game ""Gran Turismo"". Logging in thousands of hours throughout the years. Until ""Danny Moore"" played by Orlando Bloom with blessings from Nissan and the creator of ""Gran Turismo"", ""Kazunori Yamauchi"" played by Takehiro Hira.""Danny"" came up with the idea to have a tournament turning a top-tier gamer in ""Gran Turismo"" into an actual top-tier race car driver. Getting a former race car driver to be his pit crew chief in ""Jack Salter"" played by David Harbour. You watch the amazing true story of a gamer turning into the actual thing he's been playing all along.""Gran Turismo"" was not only a Phenomenal video game film but a phenomenal film. The way it was shot was amazing. The cinematography to the way they would go from a virtual scene to a real one. The way the engines hummed. If you're into racing or cars this will scratch that itch for you. They flawlessly transferred a video game to the big screen.I'm still mad at Archie Madekwe. I'm not over how his character was in season two of the AppleTV+ series ""See"". I've been seeing Archie in more things lately. His career is starting to take off. I loved the innocence he brought to this real character. I was even getting upset at the relationship he had with ""Audrey"" played by Maeve Courtier-Lilley. I'm like if you don't kiss the girl and stop playing games. Archie had me invested in the film even the parts he frustrated me with.I loved that the real ""Jann"" played as a stunt driver in his film. This film touched home for me in so many ways. Not only is ""Gran Turismo"" near and dear to my heart. My brothers and I spent many hours playing this game. Also, both my brothers are biracial and from Great Britain. So this film had an eerie connection to me. As I watched I just kept saying to myself this could be my brothers.What an amazing journey and they say what can video games do for you in the real world? Well, this is just one example of what video games can do for you. A lot. An excellent film, that gives you a mixture of young and seasoned actors.I had no clue this was all based on a true story. I have so much respect for everyone involved, especially Jann. I give this film five mor fires üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

"Gran Turismo","Entertainmentsparadise","29 August 2023","Gran Turismo proves to be surprisingly captivating, offering crucial moments that meticulously delve into the world of professional car racing. While incorporating subtle nods to PlayStation and video games, the movie follows a straightforward narrative. The focal point remains on Jahn, a Gran Turismo simulation gaming prodigy, who aspires to transition from gaming stardom to becoming a professional racer. The storyline takes us through his journey, touching upon trials, tribulations, and moments of doubt, all culminating in a harrowing accident that gripped the entire theater audience.Although these moments could have been more intense, they manage to do justice to the story, leaving room for interpretation based on individual perspectives, whether at the beginning or end of the movie. Personally, I found myself engrossed from start to finish. The plot is intriguing and the actors performance, straddling the line between simulation and reality, is impeccably executed-a quality I especially appreciated as both a gamer and a movie enthusiast.Considering all factors, I firmly bestow upon Gran Turismo a solid rating of 3.5 out of five stars. It's definitely worth a watch, and the experience becomes even more immersive if you're seated in the dbox, allowing you to feel every bump and bruise as if you were part of the action. Gran Turismo successfully highlights the perilous nature of NASCAR racing, offering a global nod to gamers everywhere.","2/10"
"Gran Turismo","thaipirate","4 February 2024","I play a lot of GT7. And in VR too. I also watch a lot of motor sport.This Movie is so wrong on so many counts. None of this is right. The production obviously had nobody that played the game or knows FIA Regs. The way the kid won the first race from the back ??? And was still not the choice???No im sorry. This movie had it all wrong. And with a little bit of help it could be so much better.Just. Red. Light.No redeeming features. Yes my favourite car In the game is the nismo GTR but after that it's all wrongIt's yet another hang on let me find another gear or shift down and pedal it to win stupid movie with as much about racing as titanic had about shipbuilding.","7/10"

Its cringed and American to the Max...script and production packing of movie is laughable...even a Driven with Sly is great masterpiece compare to this üí©.

"Gran Turismo","jonnytheshirt","19 November 2023","Well I didn't realise Neill Blomkamp directed this movie so that was a nice surprise. Some may assume this is another video game movie adaptation however it actually opts for a story based on real life which breathes something fresher into the movie. I'm not even a fan of any racing game (other than MarioKart on the original Wii - there is no other for me) however the movie was able to take this true life story and deliver an occasionally touching and rousing movie. Add in a solid cast GT manages to rise above the typical package tropes of this type of a movie and deliver a well paced enjoyable underdog sporting/gaming film for both types of fan.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","irishboy141","24 January 2024","This is a standard sports movie and a very good one. Classic underdog plot. The racing scenes are excellent and the 4K disc is fantastic and reference quality. The actors are great and trying, the lead kid was especially good. The writing is decent too and it's nice it acknowledges how dumb the idea of sim drivers sounds. It was interesting research learning that this was a thing for 6 or so years.Definitely give this movie a shot, it's solid, fun, and refreshing. It's nice watching a grounded/realistic car/racing movie after all the Fast and Furious garbage we get force-fed year after year.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","tuckermarty","25 August 2023","We went into this movie with no understanding of the story and walked out saying to each other that this was the best movie we have seen in a very long time. It maintains an intensity that glues you to it.It is based on a true story that makes you feel as if the real people were actually playing their real parts. That is how well this came across on the screen. Recommend that this be seen in the movie theater as seeing it on your television with your own sound system won't do it justice.Give this movie a chance and you will not be disappointed. A definite 10 out of 10. Movie of the year!!!","9/10"

I am a female who knows nothing about gaming or racing, yet I was interested in this movie because it's based on a true story and I love those, yet I was not expecting this movie to be as EXCELLENT as it was. It's EDGE-OF-YOUR SEAT EXCITING, TOUCHING, INSPIRING, HOPEFUL, ALMOST LIKE YOU ARE REALLY ARE IN THE RACE CAR WITH HIM, GREAT MORAL/VALUE LESSONS, HEART-STOPPING, EXHILARATING- this moving is EVERYTHING. On top of all that, it's SUPERIOR ACTING by everyone, especially the main character. I was speechless!!","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","youssefhossam","11 August 2023","I don't get the critics low score this is a really good movie.The story is great and what makes it very good is that it's based on a true story so, it gives you the feeling that dreams really come true and that nothing is impossible.The racing scenes are breathtaking and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie experience in the cinema is great especially if you're in IMAX or 4dx.The one thing I can take on the movie is that sometimes the plot is kind of predictable. You'll get the feeling that there's something great you're watching but needs more of a plot twist to keep you thinking.Overall the movie is great and definitely worth watching.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","asgarhaider8","22 August 2023","At first glance, you would hope that it would be just another racing movie. But my God i was proven wrong. Being based on a true story is hard enough to portray in the big screens.I loved the adrenaline rush it gave me as the plot moves on. Archie as Jann showed pure character and you can literally feel the struggles. Also want to add that I watched it in ScreenX theatre and highly probable that it added to the experience of this well directed movie. David Harbour is as usual was awesome and the character grew on me. Orland Bloom was alright.The screenplay of the movie was key to the success in my opinion. Enjoyed a movie in theatre after a long time.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","gustavogmcosta","27 September 2023","Not an actual review... but didn't anybody else found the similarities between the boss of Capa Team with Jos Verstappen? And the same with Nicholas Capa with Max Verstappen? Might just be me I guess... The movie itself is fun. Not a fantastic movie but does it job as an entertaining action, racing, gaming picture. Quite over the top sometimes and also very ficcional. It's based very loosely on a true story and it doesn't show any shame in twisting the truth for dramatic effects. It works here. My only problem was, being based on a game that made it's sucess looking to be the most accurate with cars and tracks, they just didn't care with some of them... being Le Mans almost ridiculous.","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","moviemanmo973","5 September 2023","This was very enjoyable. There wasn't anything that stood out as a negative other than it is a bit predictable. It is based on a true story which makes it an incredible story.The acting overall was good and there were a bit of emotional moments which I did not expect. David Harbour, Djimon Hounsou and Archie Madekwe all gave solid performances. The rest of the actors had very small roles but helped carry the story.The racing sequences and the action were good. The special affects were also very cool. The pacing of the film was just right and did not feel like it dragged at any moment.The music and sounds were also very enjoyable. Although this was a solid film I don't feel like I was blown away by it but it is a film I would watch again.","6/10"

So many movies seem preoccupied with that stuff.I don't write reviews but this movie is, both, worth the watch and a great review!","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","danchilton-71955","5 October 2023","It's tough times at the box office these days but if there's one film this year that doesn't need to worry about ticket sales surely it's Gran Turismo. In addition to being a feature long advert for the game it's named after there is so much product placement packed into the production that it must have been in the black before a single person saw the finished movie. Even after paying Orlando Bloom for the world's most expensive Ross Kemp impression. Bizarrely, due to the racing setting and overall kitsch factor, the excessive marketing doesn't derail the film.The basis of Gran Turismo is that back in 2008 Sony and Nissan got together to offer players of the Gran Turismo videogame the opportunity to train as real life racing drivers. This is based, albeit with a massive slice of creative licence, on one of the successful contestants.What follows is the most by the numbers sport story you could imagine. Plucky kid with big dreams tested in all the ways you expect. A stern father who wants what's best for his son but doesn't understand his dreams. Gruff mentor with a past who is won over by the lead characters determination. Snide rivals who underestimate the hero. Generic love interest who has no real part in the plot. It's all here interspersed with Sony Walkmans, copious billboards and of course plenty of talk about how realistic the game is. ""I've played it, it's.... Extraordinary"" whispers Bloom in awe when selling the racer idea. More or less the entire first 15 minutes or so are variations on this sentence.Despite it's limitations though Gran Turismo is pretty fun. The cast are solid with Archie Madekwe making protagonist Jann likable enough to root for and David Harbour unsurprisingly nailing the grouchy coach role. There is one strange casting choice with former Spice Girl (and perhaps more pertinently wife of F1 team boss Christian Horner) Geri Halliwell appearing as Jann's mum. She is fine but there's no getting around the fact its distracting having Ginger Spice at the dinner table.The real star of the show is the racing. These scenes look and sound great, giving a real sense of thrill and danger even if the outcome is always pretty predictable. This may be a far cry from his District 9 glory days but director Neil Blomkamp clearly still knows what he's doing behind the camera.You're not going to spend much time thinking about Gran Turismo once the chequered flag is waved but if you don't mind a large helping of cheese then there's worse ways to spend your time than checking it out.6 pre orders out of 10 videogames.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","yelrek","26 August 2023","I was not sure what to expect, which is nice going into a movie and truly enjoyed the whole experience. It was nice to see a story without dark humor, violence, politics. I enjoy those elements, but was pleasantly surprised to not get any of those vibes from this movie. The racing scenes were awesome, they did a great job getting the audience really immersed into a race. Truly demonstrated the talent and power involved with these races. The acting was well done, by that I mean there was never a moment where I felt like someone was acting, I never had to look at my watch or realize I was watching a movie. That alone is a win. This movie was able to take the audience out of their reality for a couple hours. Highly recommend viewing this in the theater. I wish I would have seen it in IMAX. Go check this one out. It's a nice feel good story with some crazy challenges and didn't give anyone too much of an impression that anyone can go from couch to professional athlete.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","simbiat","1 January 2024","It's one of those movies, that you can't hate, but you can't like, too.There is nothing particularly wrong with the movie. It looks good, the story overall is ok, too. But it feels kind of... Empty? Pointless? I did not feel much of a challenge in Jann reaching his dream, even though, I'm pretty sure, it was not that easy. Since there is no challenge, and since we already know how things will end (thanks to marketing) - there is absolutely no tension, there are no real stakes, there is no... Excitement. Which is core of racing, is it not?I remember people complaining that anime ""Overtake!"" lacked excitement in its racing, which was a valid criticism, but, at the least, it had something besides that: character development. It was not perfect, but it was there. Gran Turismo lacks even that. Or at least, I have not noticed any development. Besides, maybe, Jack Salter starting to believe that gamer can become a racer, after all.The original story is something that can inspire. That's what all the marketing was talking about: ""achieve your dream"". But achieving a dream is not easy. There are struggles involved there. Yes, they probably will not be as intense as being in literal war, but they will be there. A movie - is a great opportunity to dramatize those struggles, to make you feel the tension of going against the flow.This movie fails at that. Unless you think integrating elements from a game user interface equates to dramatization. I will forget this movie by tomorrow.","4/10"
"Gran Turismo","spaulagain","2 October 2023","This film is entertaining but lacks the grit and rawness I expected from a Neill Blomkamp film. There are some fun directing techniques that add to the racing scenes and video game roots. But so much of the writing and direction feels overly Hollywood, corny and cliche. None of the characters ever really feel fleshed out so massive events have very little weight to them.As a racing fan and someone who does track days, I found that the ridiculous exaggeration of racing and the horrible inaccuracies completely took me out of the film and made it feel comical rather than authentic. Coupled with the use of contemporary technologies and content, it was very distracting from what was a true story (kind of).Overall it's entertaining especially for the average audience. But if you're a Blomkamp or racing fan, prepare to be disappointed.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","bricecarducci","25 July 2023","Went to see Gran Turismo in theaters today due to regals $5 mystery advanced screening movie. The first half of this movie was very boring, dull, and was like every other racing movie out there. The second half dove more into the other characters in the film rather than just Jann, which I found to be slightly interesting. One thing I did like was the father's development throughout the movie. I personally found the soundtrack to be very lackluster rather than the very surprising appearance by Joji. Kenny G also made a few appearances in the soundtrack as well. Overall it wasn't the worst movie out there but I would defenitly take my chances with other movies such as Barbie and insidious 5.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","Steve9920","29 September 2023","Not a big racing fan, not a gamer , never owned a Nissan, but I do like based on true stories films, and David harbour, so two things that attracted me to Gran Turismo. Its over two hours of the usual stuff, an underdog, underdogs family, underdogs tense parental relationship, underdog finds true love, underdog finds a Nemesis (or two), underdog turns around a hard bitten cynically doubting mentor, underdog overcomes fears and doubts..etc.The racing sequences are exciting, and the overlayed gaming graphics just the right side of distracting. The soundtrack enhances with great engine noises and music tracks. The hero is likeable and not too heroic looking ( though at one point he did sound remarkably like Clive Owen?). And there is Ginger Spice in there too.Almost makes me want to buy a Playstation, but not a Nissan.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","terryraywilliams","19 September 2023","In regards to the handful of movies I've seen this summer, Gran Turismo is the best of them all. I don't recall getting emotional at the theatres my whole life, however, this one took the cake and on so many levels.It takes a superior movie to keep your focus throughout. I didn't want to miss anything once things got started. Right off top I was blown away. This is something I'll appreciate for years to come.The next thing on my agenda is to go see Gran Turismo again before it gets released on DVD. There are only two movies on my mind to eventually purchase this year so far. With that said, this one is my favorite of the two. The very best, or should I say again, the absolute best.I'm at a loss for words to describe how great this film really is, and I highly recommend seeing it for yourself.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","KatieDuncan44","26 August 2023","It's based on a true story. They did a lot of things to the film to make it more simple for viewers to understand though. For example, they were actually many coaches but they consolidated it down to one coach for this film. It was actually the third time they had this competition, but for this film they made it seem like it was the first time they had this competition. Just things to make it more sensational and simple for the viewers. But I would rather that they made it more realistic and just kept it true to form. Because, in a way this movie was a little bit too simple and it needed more variance and spice and Dynamics. I'm not that into sports. And I'm not into racing either. So maybe this show would be more interesting to me as well if I was more interested in car racing and sports. I kind of wish I saw more behind the scenes of what the investors thought as well, like the company Nissan and PlayStation and the Japanese creators that would have been interesting. I'm into business drama! And maybe the perspective of the fans would have been interesting as well. That wasn't really included much in this movie. Just hum drum citizens. Somehow it was too one dimensional? We saw the main character and his two coaches mostly. We saw a slight tiny scenes with family and other competitors. I don't know it was a long film already so I guess they couldn't do too much more but I don't know I needed more dynamics of different angles of the plot going on. And somehow it lacked a certain ark that it needed. Like I didn't have the correct build up and drop that the show needed to have more bang. It almost had wow power in the emotional aspect but somehow it didn't quite hit it. I guess the acting was good. I'm not the best judge of acting though. It was nice to see cars I guess. And to appreciate technology behind games and cars. Which normally I don't care but maybe next time I buy a car I will be spicier and technologically cool and fancy and yada.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","stevenmortonuk","20 December 2023","This popped up on Netflix so I thought I'd give it a watch and I was pleasantly surprised. Apparently, it's based on a true story but movies tend to use that in the loosest of senses.The movie itself is fine. It's a decent underdog story and the story moves at a decent pace. The acting is fine: David Harbour is good (despite his character being rather unlikeable at times) but Archie Madekwe is a bit wooden and lacks the charisma to really make you invest in his journey.There are some corny scenes that involve almost panto like villains, but the movie overall is worth watching.Decent without being outstanding.","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","dbgeorge","20 November 2023","The fact I could not finish the movie does not mean the movie is bad. I watched primarily to see Emilia Hartford, but her role is minor in the half of the movie I did watch. I was excited to see David Harbour from Stranger Things in the movie, and his role is great. Some of the special effects are cool. I just thought everything was mediocre and I eventually got bored. Not a lot of character development. A lot of clich√© dialogue and situations. Nothing was bad. I will probably go back and finish the movie one day. Maybe the third act will justify watching the film. I was hoping for more excitement.","10/10"

So I could even give this 10/10 because that's how good it was. I also did not expect it to be that good basing on how bad this 2023 Hollywood year, when you do watch something nice it is very shocking!","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","roaringbunny-373-992551","13 August 2023","Gran Turismo is by far the best movie overall that we've seen in a long, long time. If Barbie can make 1B already, this one should make 2B at least - because Gran Turismo far exceeds watchability! (you still should see Barbie, because as flawed as it is, Magot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are individually fantastic) But you will enjoy Gran Turismo much more.Gran Turismo is not complex, there's no propaganda, and of course, the action sequences require the Biggest Screen you can find for viewing, IMAX was stunning. Young, Old, and where ever you are on the political spectrum, this is just fun, sometimes sweet, direct storytelling with the best racing effects possible. This movie is the best investment this summer for your entertainment budget, without question.Don't be worried about reviews that mention Gamers - sure, they love it, and also so does everyone else, even those of us that still have a cassette Walkman around...","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","syed_uzair","8 August 2023","It was a great experience watching it in the theatre and being able to relate to the in-game Gran Tourismo experience with what was shown in the movie. It was a solid adaptation with some desirable better CGI quality but all in all it was a good watch.The length of the movie is fair it doesn't get boring at any point and keeps you hooked to the screen plus there are eastereggs here and there for GT fans to enjoy.If you're on the fence and a player of GT7 on PS5 or have played previous entries in the series then its a must watch and for other move goers it's much better than a lot of other stuff in the cinemas right now.","1/10"
"Gran Turismo","redcanofevil","29 September 2023","Another videogame movie, which not long ago would be code for bad movies that completely misses the mark. Luckily we're way past that and videogame movies have been a delight to watch. This is no popcorn-flick, this was actually a really solid movie. But it won't be for everyone, you need to be a fan of racing, you need to be a fan of GranTurismo on Playstation. GT is my favorite racing franchise and I love racing, I play GTsport on PS4 and still play GT6 on my PS3.The movie lives upto the games, I mean it wasn't that difficult to do so. But they did justice to the games. The shortcomings were definitely the barebones script, a stereotypical predictable ups and downs, the unnecessary dramatic photo finishes and the love angle. The acting was functional, there were emotions behind them at times but for the most part it wont blow anyone away. The main lead is a good example, he's not someone you'd wanna root for if you've never played a racing game. But if you have then you'd be cheering him on because he got to be where we all wish we could be playing on our controllers. He is carrying the unfulfilled hopes and dreams of all us gamers, rooting for him is natural because he becomes a self-insert. Orlando Bloom was flat, David Harbor atleast put some effort.As for the driving aspect, the game to real racing transition we're pretty amazing. The vibration and shaky cam were a joy, regret not watching it in theaters. I feel they could've done more on track racing but trust me, you wont realize this while watching.The direction was a letdown, the runtime a bit too long, the soundtrack mostly doesn't work but it somehow still fades when the actual racing begins. There were some really unrealistic parts in the movie, things that would never happen in real life but this isn't a documentary.Its not a perfect film but it does what it sets out to do. Inspire the feeling and keep the dream alive for the millions of racing game enthusiast that didn't get to race. If you can relate to this aspect then this is the film for you, if you are a casual it still should be a decent watch considering the low grade garbage we keep getting. And if you're not a fan of racing at all then why are you even watching this?","9/10"
"Gran Turismo","nmcarroll","3 December 2023","Two hour runtime that felt liket four. Just a massive marketing exercise for Sony, PlayStation and Nissan. The story is pretty boring and by the numbers. One of the worst movies I've seen in recent times. The lead character is unlikable. Furthermore, it just doesn't seem very believable. Looking up his record, he is an average driver in the real world at Best. It really looks like a movie that was aimed at 15-year-old gamers and nobody else. Awful stuff really. On the plus side, some of the camera will work during the races was great. That was a high pint, but it just took too long to get there.","8/10"
"Gran Turismo","nataliacorbillon","26 August 2023","Between all CGI packed superhero movies, 7 part of something and based on best sellers, watching something like this is the most fun I have had in a while at the cinema. I went with my kid who loves cars and videogames, so he is ecstatic after watching it obviously. But I found myself hyped from the beginning to the end. There's nothing too surprising or pretentious. It doesn't pretend to win an Oscar. It tells an inspiring story and entertains you, making you hold your breath in a few occasions. Shout out to Orlando Bloom, who finally got rid of the ""I am a pretty boy"" rol and after the first 5 minutes made me forget that it was him acting.Highly recommended.","10/10"
"Gran Turismo","mick-18173","28 August 2023","First off me and my girlfriend are movie enthusiasts and we were really only trying to see a film because it was national cinema day, but wow was I shocked by this movie. The trailer sucked and I believe the marketing team should 100 percent be held accountable for low audience turnout. The trailer didn't do the movie just at all. I was in a emotional rollercoaster all movie and how they portrayed the car scenes was like no other racing movie I've seen. A lot of people see this as sorta ""cringey"" because it's about a gamer, but I see it as something I've never seen before. Imagine you're sitting at home playing a sim game and you're chosen to be strapped into a 200mph machine. That is just absurd and before this movie I've never heard of that. Although some of the acting was mediocre during the drama scenes, it doesn't change the fact that this movie does an excellent job at showing not only the car in action but the realness of being behind the wheel. I give this movie a solid 8 and 100 percent believe if you like video games and or racing this is a movie you must see!","7/10"

The only racing movie i can say that is at thesame level is ford vs ferrari, the fact that this movie is a true life story is also a added advantage, the tracks, cars, locations and all just made it worth it, you can feel the tenson, the g force and all, lol, but as a sim racer i love this movie, i cant wait for it to come out in blu ray, this is by far the best playstation adaptation, big thumbs up guys, u did it.","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","shenamere","23 January 2024","Who doesn't like the sound of engines roaring and the excitement of a race. The competitive, come from behind, never say never, do or die, trust your gut, go for broke, believe in yourself and so on. The movie desperately tries to sell Gran Turismo games and NIssmo racing. Apart from that it is the teenager gamers showing the world how real a simulation is. The truth is a little different when searching for the Le Mans run by Nissmo. It didn't qualify and the project was disbanded. Not because of drivers, but because of the car. So enjoy the fantasy. Fantastic special effects. Great suspense and decent acting. Story line has expected hiccups to the finish. Feel the rush!","5/10"
"Gran Turismo","MovieLuver365","28 August 2023","I had high hopes for this movie. As an ""Unbelievable Inspiring Story"", it falls a bit flat. In fact, there was something missing from the entire movie that makes it all seem flat and one dimrnsional.can't put my finger on it, but it just seemed cheap and ""B"".I was also hoping that there would be more emphasis on the challenges associated with moving from the virtual to the real world, but they didn't delve much into that, just could he do it, yes or no.I walked out once he qualified for the racing team. I didn't think it could end better than the movie had already been. If he won, i simply could not have suspended my disbelief in order to enjoy it. If he didn't, well, at that point it would have just been sad.There was a scene in the beginning that could have foreshadowed a good movie. The scene where his father wanted him to come out and play futbol. How to succeed in the physical world. That's what he needed to learn all along. But those intracacies were not explored, even in a 2+ hour movie.Djimon Hounsou was excellent, and delivered what I thought to be the best performance in the film. I remember him from Gladiator and Blood Diamond. Whatever ""it"" is, he's got it. :)I hope to see this ""conversion"" issue addressed in upcoming movies. Our youth need to learn how to live in the real world, and what better way than the movies? :)","7/10"
"Gran Turismo","markospohn","11 February 2024","Maybe some spoilers here...Well i am a big GT fan and i played it a lot and maybe thats the problem. The film can give excitement and makes you feel good but as a racing fan and as a GT fan in particular there are some things that are simply stupid or make the film look bad.Literally noone plays with the racing line and braking zones on. Maybe as a noob on your first playthrough but noone ever on a competitive level will do this.Its a cool effect to see the car build virtually around Jann while he ist driving but seeing the brakes going red and then hearing only accelerating sounds is bad.There are a lot of stupid phrases like press the gas pedal harder. Only someone with no experience will say such stuff.Same with the ""opportunity"" for overtaking. Noone can overtake into a corner by downshifitg and the giving full throttle. Again simply stupid if you ever seen a real race or played GT.Same with the gap of 6 seconds or more and gaining i this in less than 1 lap. 1 tenth can make you start from 1oth playe instead of pole position thats so much time in racing its ridiculous to gain that time in one lap.Lame conversation and cheering on the guy by saying ther can only be one winner. Yawn...nothing really special.And almost all of the overtakings are like fake overtakes that are only possible if you have 100 horsepower more or are simply unrealistic.I think the more you know about racing the less you will enjoy that movie. Its like the 12 gear cars in NFS.","6/10"

Besides, there is nothing wrong with building enhanced suits for soldiers, that will save lives, when your being invaded by alien armies every few years!The room with the alien tech in it, didn't have anyone guarding it. She pickpockets a pass and walks in, then walks out. Walking past the entrance to another corridor that did have a guard next to it. What was in that corridor that it warranted a guard? And this one with the advanced weapon in it did not? Then the scientist she stole the pass from, walks back into the room without his pass?The building it put in lockdown, but the boy just walks out. So much for lock down.The beetle suit (and OMAC) is never explained. It can seemingly do anything but how? Where do the bullets come from? How are they replenished? How is it charged?When they drain the suit for the code, they tell us repeatedly it will kill him. They drain the code, but he lives. So what a waste of time. A plot point that went nowhere.Blue Beetle doesn't want to kill. But the Uncle is willing to stab people with the bug mobile legs. Grandma machine guns down security guards just doing their job.The Uncle builds a localised signal jammer, and the building he uses it on with high-tech weapons inside doesn't hit the alarm when all their feeds go dead. Besides the fact that there was zero guards in the main lobby, and the blue beetle tech is in a display cabinet which can be picked with a paperclip?The uncle can pilot the bug mobile having never seen it before, just because he drives a truck.

Its just another superhero movie.What it really is is just Ironman meets Spiderman. No one really cares about this character so they would have had to do something special to make the movie great. But they haven't. Cobra Kai's Xolo Maridue√±a is likeable enough as the hero. But everyone in this (except Susan Sarandon) is the hero. Either that or they're an annoying ""comedy"" sidekick.At least the action starts overshadowing the lame jokes at the half way mark. As before that its just the character getting thrown around as he discovers his powers. But even later its just robots fighting. This is something we've seen a hundred times at this point. But at least the hero doesn't fight Susan Sarandon in the finale.So i guess it could have been worse. Its not completely awful. There's just too many superheros now to care about this familiar feeling one.","4/10"

"Blue Beetle","HabibieHakim123","18 August 2023","I found Blue Beetle as the most basic teenage superhero origins story that are no longer special, and it leaves me no impress whatsoever because we all already way too familiar with this type of story, it's predictable and literally nothing new, it's bland and the action was boring, my face was literally straight the whole time, and the villain was also meh, what i like about Blue Beetle was the family dynamic that's definitely there, and the family itself as their own was good enough, Bruna Markuezine was good, including Xolo Maridue√±a himself was good and just if his story wasn't the same like most of teenage superhero origins story, Blue Beetle would've been something else because what i do like again was some of the cinematography, editing, the Blue Beetle suit was amazing and i really love it, and the special effects for the most part was good, but again overall i just can't found something new in terms of story, and it would've been just an ok movie but it's too bad that the action was boring and the comedy also didn't work, the villain wasn't that good, so it is what it is unfortunately, Blue Beetle is not a bad movie, it's a basic teenage superhero origins that fills with ok performances but a predictable and unoriginal story and also boring action and uninteresting villain.","5/10"

The CGI is not that good, and it will not make you marvel, plus the story is predictable, and I might suggest - quite larval, the acting's amateur, so is the dialogue and score, it's a challenge after watching to applaud and not ignore.If we're really unlucky they'll make another one that will take us to places increasingly common in the world of Superhero desperation.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","FeastMode","18 August 2023","Let's get the positives out of the way first. The musical score is pretty good, although not up to the normal DC standards for music. There are a couple of cool action moments. Half of the comedic attempts made me laugh. And I loved the intro artwork/music, it got me excited.The bad... sigh. Blue Beetle is fairly boring and had difficulty getting me invested. The majority feels generic with nearly everything having been seen in other superhero movies. The one it seemed to copy the most is Shang-Chi. Numerous aspects are nearly identical. Like the zany sister who never stops talking and gets him into trouble. It's the same character that Awkwafina plays. They even steal jokes from it. I knew the joke was coming because I had already seen it in Shang-Chi.But the biggest problem with this movie is that the protagonist doesn't drive the plot. Things happen TO him, not BECAUSE of him. And he is saved by something or someone an absurd number of times. It becomes laughable and makes it difficult to root for him.To make it worse, we have the stock-est of all stock villains. She's played by veteran actress Susan Sarandon. Not only was this a terrible casting choice, she gives an atrocious performance. Her line delivery is cringe. It doesn't help that the dialogue is terrible.I mentioned that half the comedic attempts made me laugh. The other half are awful. They were either cheesy or fully predictable. I knew exactly what would happen or what the punch line would be.This movie is also extremely dumb. It's mostly small stuff that can be ignored if it happens once or twice. But it happens 100 times, no exaggeration. I'll give an example. The enemy starts shooting at his friends. Rather than stopping the enemy who is right next to him, he turns around and runs towards his friends. Why? To yell, ""you guys need to get out of here."" It's just bad writing.I have no allegiance to DC or Marvel, but I truly feel sad for the die-hard DC fans. They continue to receive bad movies and have to watch as the once endless potential of the Snyderverse is thrown away.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 8/17/2023)","3/10"
"Blue Beetle","Tweetienator","19 September 2023","What you get are some okay action sequences and okay special effects. That's more or less the core of Blue Beetle. The story is one straight out of generic-not-so-wonderland, lacking any creativity and any juice (in my opinion, simply embedding a pretty standard story in another cultural context is not the work of a creative titan). At most, this flick will engage three or four of your brain cells. Moreover, most of the fun and comedy elements don't work too well either. These days, writers, directors, and producers seem to think that they can get away with anything because of the work of the special effects department - good storytelling seems an art mostly lost these days. Blue Beetle tastes like one of those chewing gums that have long lost all flavor. Unfortunately, there is no power of cheese to save this one with some decent high-octane schlock. My exact rate: 3.5.","3/10"

I'm not into the cancellation system kids have nowadays when there is prejudice or when it just looks like there is prejudice at stake but I think who wrote this doesn't mean it, maybe it was really written by a 10 year old.The stereotypical Latino family thing that reminds me of a Fast and Furious surrogate scenario but with clowns instead of braindead glorified criminals.I just want to regurgitate after watching this. My eight year old was bored like hell. She is way smarter that the guys who thought this was a good idea. The portrayal of the Latin community showed here isn't very serious. Off course there are happy positive resilient people in those communities but taking every stereotype and put it all at once in a family and making them look like the jesters is really annoying. This wasn't a fun movie, it's forgettable, it's the same old story again, it's meek, it has no villain , it's meh...
I wish superhero's could be treated more seriously than what they are getting this days. If you looked to South Korean show ""Moving"" you could learn a thing or two but no: the american paternalistic media society will only take that show and do a remake just because in their deranged conceptions Americans can't read and a foreign language is too annoying and capable of brain damage or creating communists or democrats as they call it there(Lol). Anyway, having a Batman (after Nolan) isn't enough. DC is way more childish and the CGI is always the worst but Marvel movies ,although better like their comics always were, are getting seriously damaged by the idea every hero needs to be Deadpool or Spider-Man copycats.Once again ,DC has shot itself in the foot, wait...it blew both feet with a single shot.","1/10"

"Blue Beetle","tdsearles25","20 August 2023","ORIGIN: I am writing this as I watch the movie. So far the first 40 minutes are basically the combination of Spiderman(Iron Spider cant control suit), Ironman(the suit mimics Ironman in looks, function and design) and Venom(alien symbiote attempting to work with human host) origin stories. There is nothing new, fresh or interesting here. It has all been done before, only better.FOCUS: I like the family focus here. However, George Lopez is exhausting and cringe throughout. Kind of like Thor Love and Thunder dragging out the screaming goats joke; that is George Lopez in this movie. Very forced. Otherwise, the family focus works.DESIGN: The Blue Beetle suit and design is probably the highlight and coolest part of the movie. Though, its nothing too different than what we have seen Ironman, Spiderman or Venom do.VILLAIN/PLOT: Extremely weak, predictable, clich√© and underwhelming. We all knew exactly where everything was going.XOLO MARIDUENA: I was really rooting for him. And he wasn't bad. But his acting skills don't always work. Maybe give him some more time to develop before handing him such a large role?TONE: Like the trend of recent superhero movies. The tone is Chaos. Think more chaos=better movie. Only when done correctly.VISUALS: Better than The Flash but that's not saying much.Overall, this is just more of the same. Look at Shazam 2, Thor Love and Thunder, Flash, Antman 3. The trend of new superhero movies are trying too hard, cringe, not doing anything fresh and overall very average movies.As a side note. DC is dying, sadly. What is this, 7 flops in a row? Call me crazy but I don't think fans are too thrilled about the announced reboot. OR they'd be showing up to the box office? $24m opening weekend? Yikes.Its a shame.

"Blue Beetle","pinkled5","19 August 2023","The dialog in the very first scene was so bad that I couldn't help but laugh out loud. I hoped it would get better, but it didn't. Every line Susan Sarandon's character says is some of the worst written dialog, and not even her acting chops could salvage it. But it's not just her character, the entire movie is full of terrible exposition presented in what seems like the laziest manner possible.The plot is paper thin, too. The only thing the main character wants is money to save his parent's home. Everything that happens to him is caused by happenstance, serendipity, or a ridiculously hard to believe contrivance. I was given no reason to root for any of these characters.I did like how they tried to develop the family dynamic, and I was hoping I could rally around that, but even that was clunky, at best. I had the urge to walk out from the very opening scene, but I forced myself to stay for nearly an hour. Eventually, the urge became too strong and I could no longer overcome it, and left the theater about halfway through.I'll give this a 3/10 because the actors were trying their best with what they were given, and it really showed in their performances. I especially enjoyed George Lopez's performance, but it wasn't enough to save this film. I also thought the CGI was pretty good (except for the shot looking up inside the Kord building, that shot looked rough).","3/10"
"Blue Beetle","MiroslavKyuranov","16 August 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is simply B or even C grade super hero movie with some charm along the way. I don't think it will be realistic to expect something else to be honest. The trailers showed that pretty well in my opinion.The tone of the movie is close to that of ""Shazam!"", given the fact that the family got bigger role in it again, that said the story is not all that good. Not that ""Shazam!"" got some epic story, but I think it was one idea better.The cast is fine, maybe the best part of the movie is the family dynamic, except when they lean too much to the melodrama side. Xolo Maridue√±a as Jaime/Blue Beetle and George Lopez are the standouts no doubt.The villain is everything you ca expect from B grade super hero movie, from the introduction, through his motivation, the fights and the conclusion is nothing particularly memorable.I must say the suit looks great when is practical and not CGI all over the place. There are some cool fight scenes with our protagonist, most of which are shown in the trailers, which is kinda of a shame.There are plenty of jokes in the movie, but for me, most of them doesn't land. I mean they are too childish. I guess the younger auditory will laugh out hard, but me and my cinema crowd were silent most of the time. Of course there were funny moments, but don't expect ""Deadpool"" level laughs if you are a bit older.The movie is not bad, but it's kinda cringe, predictable and given the fact that the audience know this genre already, they expect something more clever, which sadly to report ""Blue Beetle"" is not.There are already enough talks about the future of this character, is it part of the DCEU or DCU, will there be a sequel, or the character will transfer in the newly formed universe? If you ask me, there will not be a second movie, because this one will bomb hard, also, I'm not sure how you can do clean slate without the bagage of the previous universe, when you always lean to what was, not what it can be. In other words there is always a chance to see Blue Beetle again, but who will portray it and will the origin story be 1:1 identical is something I'm not sure about and I don't hold my breath for it.In conclusion the movie is ""okay"", got its moments, but there is nothing really memorable, also there are two credit scenes, which are fine I guess.","6/10"

I love that DC takes the time to make action and movies more intense in their fight sequences and also does a great job at setting up characters and making you care about them.Well this movie literally just had me bored and I don't know what else to say. The only good part was the family dynamic in the movie which was nice to see but I really found myself caring very little about the characters and the villain is extremely average and uninspired.The fight scenes I just very bland and it seems like there's a lot that happens but they were just boring and very average even though they try not to be. This movie really made me contemplate why I even watch movies anymore and how predictable cinema has become instead of being something that should ignite the senses and the imagination and this was the complete opposite of that and has made me not go and watch random superhero movies anymore.I've never given any marble or DC movie of 4 out of 10 and this is the first because it just felt like a waste of my time and at no point was I excited and in fact I actually walked out in the middle of a fight scene with 25 minutes left to go in the movie.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","benjaminskylerhill","17 August 2023","For a movie being heralded as one of the least-white superhero films, Blue Beetle is white in one respect: it's as bland as plain white bread.Starting with a couple positive remarks, newcomer director √Ångel Manuel Soto has a keen eye for action. There's a rough-and-tumble quality to his camerawork that makes the fast action intermittently fun. The performances are also quite fine, with George Lopez being the primary standout and the one bright spot of personality in the film.That's about all in terms of positives. This script has the intelligence of an actual beetle, the tact of a jackhammer, and the consistency of a pandering politician.Characters? Bland. Jaime, our protagonist, complains and is cowardly until the film's last 20 minutes when a character arc is rushed upon him with no skill or feeling.Plot? Perhaps the most predictable I've ever seen in the genre. Every single moment of the movie plays out exactly as you think it would. I predicted the end of literally every single scene. Not an ounce of creativity is present in this piece of writing.Dialogue? Inane. It's always contrived, corny, and shows blatant disregard for its audience's reasoning capabilities.In short, it's a sometimes flashy piece of total redundancy that's a complete bore from start to drawn-out finish.","4/10"

Blue Beetle is another DC superhero movie failure. A Latino superhero movie that was predictable, had uninspiring characters, a weak, boring villain, and a movie that played too much on Latino stereotypes. This could have been an inspiring Latino superhero movie that many could have related to and enjoyed instead it became a jumbled, boring, amateurish mess. No, even Nana couldn't save this mess of movie. The sad part is that the 2 leads seem to have amazing chemistry together based on their rounds of promotions. But have none in the actual movie. And based on the quality of the movie, it should have been direct to Max not worthy of a theatrical release. How many poorly made DC/WB movies can be made?

I can't even fathom how the Mexican actors in there are okay with the simplistic, absurd, and ridiculous portrait of a family of immigrants depicted in this film. Xolo Maridue√±a's range of acting is clearly short. Are there really no better Mexican-descent actors in Hollywood? Disappointing. Having Susan Sarandon is not enough to save this disgrace of a film - her character is hollow and exaggerated. It's no surprise why DC's films performances are so low (in both the ticket office and quality) compared to those of Marvel. The love interest is predictable and forced.

Anyways, the plot of the movie is bland and overdone, maybe if it came out in 2015 it might have been rather enjoyable since they hype was there, although I highly doubt it since the dialogue literally made me gag throughout the entire movie.I can't say I'm disappointed in this movies flop, but I'm not surprised either.

It's also one of the funniest superhero movies ever with a very distinctive identity.There are some typical exposition dumps for the genre, and the emotional moments don't always hit the mark with a familiar structure, but it's a film with a huge heart, incredibly good humor, and excellent characters. All the ""good side"" characters are very well crafted and distinct, each of them having moments to shine.In technical terms, it has some surprises and tricks up its sleeve, with good editing, well-choreographed and entertaining fast-paced action, and a strong score and soundtrack. What's even better is the way it incorporates Latin culture to show us the true sense of community and family, elevating the film's message and contributing to most of the arcs.All the performances are outstanding.

"Blue Beetle","chand-suhas","18 August 2023","For what it's worth, this is not an origin story yet is designed to be one, atleast for the main lead. After graduation, Jaime Reyes returns back to his family who are near bankrupt and on the verge to lose their home. Desperate to save the house, he looks for a job and lands at Kord Tower, after an invitation from Jenny Kord. Meanwhile, Kord Industries CEO Victoria Kord, is a greedy woman who wants to control an alien species Scarab for it's technological power, to create a deadly weapon. Jenny's attempt to steal this Scarab leads to Jaime getting hold of it and eventually becoming the host. What follows is, Jaime realizing his purpose and acknowledging his connection with Scarab.Blue Beetle clearly has arrived a decade late, which is also what works in it's favour. There is no pressure of building in/adding on to the DC universe. All it aims for, is to be a simple silly fun entertainer, going over the top at every opportunity and yet succeed in entertaining. This is simply not the kind of film one should take seriously. The humor is hit and miss, thankfully the emotions work well. The Latino superhero does leave a lasting impression. There is not much about the Scarabs so the film directly focuses on Reyes becoming the new Blue Beetle while casually dropping the fact that there were others before.Susan Sarandon's Victoria isn't evil enough whereas her own weapon Carapax isn't menacing enough and are barely serviceable. What does work is the goofiness of the Reyes family and right dose of father-son dynamic, because what's a DC superhero without that? The action set pieces are generic and like I said, the film still delivers on providing basic harmless entertainment. The post credit scene does set it up for a standalone sequel without burdening itself from being part of DCU's planned future.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","willz187","20 August 2023","Blue Beetle is featured well in one of the Batman cartoons i think in the Brave and the Bold. In that he is a fun teenager trying to figure out his powers and how to help Bats. If you want to see a good representation of Blue Beetle i recommend finding this animated series. This movie kind of felt like Power Rangers on the CW network, albeit with a much higher budget. There was nothing to care about here. I think DC was stretching to find more characters to bring to big screen. He is a supporting character at best. It is a good comparison to Shazam 2 with all the focus on secondary characters. Both are a waste of money and a little on time. If you have nothing else to watch its ok.","3/10"

I generally don't walk out when I've paid to watch a movie the only other time was for miami vice but blue beetle was offensively bad I don't know what the director was thinking but the acting all round in this movie wasn't even fit for porn, the attempted jokes make your cringe so hard I think I actually had my eyes closed at one point, later when the blue beetles heavily overweight elderly grandmother started arming herself up for a fight with some space minigun I decided life was too short, don't see this movie not even for free.The one positive I took away from what I saw was the suit looked cool.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","marboc-64901","17 September 2023","Why can't DC have decent hero. The acting was terrible, storyline shocking and double standards typical.In some instances, the actors sounded like they were in a pantomine, the dialog was so bass.Oh no! I can't kill you, even if it saves the lives of everyone I love.... It is fine for the uncle to stomp and kill dozens of bad guys, but the beetle just punches people.Typical problem for both good and bad guys (especially one who is trained)... never leave the enemy at your back. So frustrating and ruins so many movies because EVERYONE knows what happens down the track.Please do not waste your valuable time.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","pranayjalvi","19 August 2023","Blue Beetle doesn't suffer from the ponderousness that weighs down so many other DC movies. It's lighter, more fun, and delivers the jokes, bright colors and nods to the ridiculousness that you want from a superhero movie, a slight improvement than recent DC movies.The movie has a big heart, ambitious references, and moments that make it an entertaining watch, but it can curdle thanks to the constraints of the superhero genre. The cultural specificity is also an asset but feels rushed in a format that, unlike the pacing of a series, creates a greater imperative to get to the next battle. Though it may have some novel elements, the franchise already feels tired, and isn't much more promising than recent DC efforts ""Black Adam"" and ""The Flash.My Rating: 5/10.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","adambenjamingibbons","21 August 2023","Let's start by just saying granny with a neon automatic gun. That says it all, 600 characters not needed. 4DX was pretty bad too. Bumps and shakes that just didn't make sense. Like a thud in the back when the door got kicked. Really, 4DX is trying to put me in the shoes of the door. Although as the characters were all wooden too, it probably wouldn't make much difference. I literally didn't care about any of the characters. They could have lived, or died and I wouldn't be bothered. Personalityless shells. Really silly film but also not funny, just lame. Usual poor Hollywood dialogue and unmemorable performances, with no story other than good guy has thing bad guy wants, bad guy chases good guy.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","vandreren","21 August 2023","You've seen one, you've seen them all. Blue Beetle is about as cookie-cutter as the bombastic superhero mcmovie genre comes. This generic mishmash of the well and truly worn-out superhero template differs only in that it desperately tries to pander to demographic stereotypes and messaging. The origin story needs no description, you've already seen it a hundred times over in various films, tv shows or comics. Sarandon's mailed in performance as the villain was dull, wooden, and witless. As always, George Lopez played George Lopez as well as he knows how - with the voice of a badger and the personality of a telemarketer calling you on your personal cell at 9 o'clock at night. Some will say it's superhero fatigue. For myself, it's dumpster fire exhaustion. We need to get back to making great films for everyone. Great writing, acting and directing will always have universal appeal. Blue Beetle proves yet again that the Hollywood sludge factory is entirely incapable of providing it.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","ajacayen-90247","17 August 2023","DCEU's 2023 has been at a dipping point. With the disappointment of Shazam! Fury of the Gods, in which the first one I really loved, and the somewhat decent of a Flash movie, it seems like the way the franchise is ending doesn't seem like a bang. Fortunately, Blue Beetle has already come out oh boy did it not disappoint.Now let me preface this: it is by no means a classic nor is it groundbreaking in the superhero genre. At the end of the day, I just want to have a good time in the theaters and, for the most part, it succeeds in what I'm aiming for: a fun time.Xolo Maridue√±a as the titular young Iron Man-like superhero, alter-ego Jaime Reyes, was really good. He brings a lot of energy to his performance filled with charisma, awkwardness and relatability because of his love for his family.Speaking of family, everyone was really good playing in their respective roles but George Lopez was easily the standout because of how funny his lines and reactions are towards Jaime.And the theme of the family is really at the center of Blue Beetle, it's really hard not to ignore it which is similar to Shazam. But as the film moves on, it does feel like everything that was done to make this possible was filled with heart by the filmmakers and knew just to be simply entertaining, hitting at all the right beats to make you laugh and cry.The pacing was surprisingly good as to how they were able to fill in the runtime which doesn't make it feel like two hours at all as you are watching it. It's like it took two to three days in the story, if you look at the second to the third act. That was really impressive.Visuals are great and the action sequences are really good to look at. Props to the director of photography, who by the way did Hereditary and Midsommar - yeah, let that sink in.Of course, the film is not without its faults. It is cheesy at times, does feel generic and doesn't seem like it wants to outshine the rest of the films not just in DC but everything superhero in general. But my personal issue would have to be how they handled Susan Sarandoncs character and the nemesis of Jaime. While I get where they are going, it felt like it needed to be more compelling and not just some cartoony villains.But by the end, I walked out of Blue Beetle thinking how good it was to see an enjoyable film with the message of family that hit me emotionally. Would I recommend the movie? Yes.","8/10"
"Blue Beetle","Ltufano23","28 August 2023","Blue Beetle comes at a time where Multiverses are breaking and worlds are ending, but it stays in its own corner and maintains a strong, grounded story with family at the center. The entire main cast are the heart of this film and the hispanic family dynamic feels so real and distinct. I found myself deeply connected to their story and invested in their emotional moments as if I were joining them on the journey as well. While it can be said that the rest of the story feels very repetitive from previous superhero films, that would be the biggest fault of the film. The action, emotion, and unique style leave a very memorable mark on the current state of superhero film. Had this been released 15 years ago, it could've been as big of a hit as any MCU standalone film, as it shares the same quality of the likes of Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Captain America. With the way superhero films have been, this is a breath of fresh air, even with the familiar taste.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","mindlessmoviemaster","21 August 2023","Yup that's how I knew the cringe movie was going to be as bad as it looked. This movie is just filled with cringe cliche stuff that they believe the Latino family is into. Blue Beatle needs his family to fight all his battles for him that's not surprising when you one these New Gen kids can't do anything without mommy and daddy holding thier hands and that's what this is all about. I was hoping this movie would do good too! Nope they had to ruin it with bad stereotypes. I guess that's fine stereotype it up man but BatMan is the Fascist.. I was wondering if they would take that out of the film cause they removed it from the trailers but nope they kept it in. They want to try a kill one of DCs best characters ever for a side character.. Go watch it if you love cringe cliches then this is the film for you.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","AfricanBro","18 August 2023","I remember loving blue beetle in cartoons growing up so I was excited for this. I feel like people, generally speaking, aren't as hyped up for this. I enjoyed it but it was a mixed bag, there's nothing really adventurous attempted and for the most part, just felt good or okay enough. Too many things could've been done better.The family's dynamic was fine, yet the emotional connection between Jaime and Jenny was notably nonexistent- their attempt to forge it even prompted some to audibly scream no in the theatre. The actors' portrayal felt unconvincing, and the writing felt contrived, unimaginatively executed too. The familial bond is likely to resonate with fans later in the future, as evident in their concerted effort to show Blue Beetle is a family guy, along with the Perez family ethos. They really wanted to push that narrative and hammer it home. While I do know that in my brain, but I also wanted to feel that in my heart. James Gunn is a master at this, adept at bridging the gap between what I know and what I feel about a group of characters. They had too many family talks in my opinion, tried too hard. As for Blue Beetle himself, he's a character we'll love more the more we see him(I think), making his debut a respectable foundation for the future DC Universe. However, the ongoing controversy between DCU/DCEU and James Gunn's new vision might contribute to a diverse range of reviews.Pretty good comedic timing and the jokes didn't feel contrived. The suit had a cool design, and despite not having watched Blue Beetle cartoons in over a decade, it had familiarity. The transformation into Blue Beetle was strikingly done with a hint of horror, which I found compelling. I appreciated the mix of cartoonish yet realistic action sequences. There were still some 'fast and furious' ludicrous level action scenes.Some animations looked like video games with their 3D-like quality, and a few scenes lacked the grandeur suited for IMAX screens. The density of the visuals didn't match up, perhaps I'm influenced by the standards set by ""Oppenheimer,"" which was what I saw last in IMAX. Initially planned to watch in standard 2D, I went for the earliest available viewing instead.The story was a generic but it had a lot of interesting stuff in. Beyond the superhero himself, DC's attempt to bring some novelty into the genre was lacking. Some plot reveals didn't have the impact they should've. Improved character background execution, particularly for Nana and the main villain, was needed; their histories felt like it was mentioned only for plot convenience, notably the grandmother's history just because of how it was revealed. Some dialogue and plot towards the end was very predictable.Fighting scenes were mostly cool, although apart from the final one, they didn't reach their maximum climactic potential; only the last battle drew me in. The high personal stakes were great, clearly showing what was at risk and effectively following through on those stakes.A more serious and slightly darker tone would have heightened the emotional impact of the events in the third act. The movie seemed caught between taking itself very seriously and/or embracing a fun, lighthearted vibe, leaving an uncertain feel. It lacked a distinct impact or identity, floating in a sort of no man's land. If you didn't know Blue Beetle already or indifferent towards him, the film struggled to convincingly make you fall in love with the character or feel a connection. On the positive side, the movie showcased significant Latino representation. In terms of cultural blending, I'd rank Shang-Chi, Black Panther 2, Blue Beetle, Ms. Marvel, and then the first Black Panther.The movie excels in certain parts, while its shortcomings aren't overwhelmingly bad, but they could be better. Sadly, seemed to be more of the latter. The quick post-credit scenes were nice, sparing us from what often feels like a long wait usually. Loved that they included the previous versions of blue beetle, it's also quite rare for a superhero film to have a sense of standalone authenticity, rather than just serving as a vehicle to introduce new characters or set up future movies.I typically avoid badmouthing actors, but I believe acting could've been better. As previously mentioned, my earlier comment about the love interests still stands. The chemistry between the actors, the portrayal of emotions in their eyes-whether it was excitement, agony, or loss-and the conviction of the main villain didn't resonate with me. The lack of connection and genuine emotion felt like a first draft, and felt like a mid-2000s Disney show. This contributes to the feeling of a medley mixed bag, the dialogue, story, and acting all fell short of being amazing individually. While nothing was too bad, when combined, they accentuated each other, drawing attention to each.While far from flawless, I still left with a smile. The story was somewhat straightforward, and considering Blue Beetle's unique, I half-expected the movie to reinvent the wheel, though my hopes weren't too high. There were a lot of elements of a potentially mind blowing fantastic movie, It just doesn't feel like they were pieced together the best that they could've, but definitely still enjoyable. I know it's an origin story but it just feels like DC just played it super safe; and at a time when ""superhero burnout"" is a thing, playing it safe ain't too safe.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","akira-hideyo","19 August 2023","There seems to be alot of these such movies lately where something incredible is chosen for someone to be great and the so called chosen recipient of the gift or blessing is so non deserving with highly irritating low self esteem that one starts to cheer for the bad guys instead to end the audiences' suffering. What happened to real super heroes like John Wick or Jack Ryan where they wear their battle amour with responsible conviction and honourable mission to do good without a second thought. This show comes off the lot to fill the ethnic diversity quota in Hollywood of recent push. Yes, by all means, but for goodness sake, arm such protagonist with more oomph and self pride and courage. All needs a dash of Bruce Lee to make this porridge perfect for all future Goldilocks.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","ethanbresnett","31 August 2023","Blue Beetle has the unique angle of bringing a Latin superhero character to the screen in a leading role for the first time, but outside of that nothing about this film is unique or original.The story is a formulaic superhero origin story. It's fine and it does the job but isn't particularly inspiring or overly engaging. There's an attempt to inject some emotion into the piece but it feels a little half-hearted. Susan Sarandon feels under-developed as a villain which makes the stakes feel quite low.For the most part the action is pretty bland. The final set piece is a CG blur that is a bit of a snooze and considering the skill set of Blue Beetle the action could have been a lot better.Despite all this, the performance from Xolo Mariduena is strong and he creates a likeable and engaging character, as do all his family members. There's some good humour throughout, and the film does look quite good in parts, with some decent enough direction.Overall, this film is a perfectly average superhero film. It's formulaic and uninspired, but it is a fun enough watch.","8/10"
"Blue Beetle","That_Movie_Watcher","17 August 2023","The marketing is letting this movie down! This film is so much more than just a origin story for a new superhero! This film has a lot of heart, with the directors love and care for this character being evident throughout the film! The character was introduced perfectly, and I hope it gets enough love to get a sequel because it deserves one! Also, so many touchy and difficult societal issues are brought up and tackled in respectful and nuanced ways. Their inclusion doesn't pull you out of the movie whatsoever! You aren't hit over the head with anything and these issues actually end up aiding the story and character greatly and give the film that much more of an emotional punch!The acting was phanominal as well! All of the actors gave amazing performances and really were able to convey each of the characters emotions beautifully in every scene!The action was by far the best part of the film! The camera angles and movements made you feel as if you were experiencing the fights irl! They were awesome!The comedy was also fantastic and handled perfectly! I found myself laughing every other minute at some points because the jokes were just so good! George Lopez was AMAZING throughout the film and really brought life to every scene he was in! Perfect casting!!Overall, I had a fun time with this movie and I highly recommend watching it!","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","HernanTrujillo","20 December 2023","As a Latino myself, I was looking forward to this film but, I was unfortunately disappointed. I was excited to hear that we had a superhero movie starring a Latino cast coming into the works but, it was executed poorly. There are times when they were trying too hard to portray a Latino family, a bit exaggerated and tried too hard to be funny. The acting from a few of the cast was fine, some of it felt forced. It seems like they didn't put as much heart into this film as they would a Batman film. With some work, this could've been a better viewing experience. Xolo was a great casting choice but could use a bit of work on some of his execution to the character.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","19 August 2023","When a teenager goes through a Cronenbergian symbiosis with a space scarab, he is targeted by the corporation that discovered it.I watch almost all of these comic book adaptations, and it's rare that I see one with this much heart, and one that wears it on its sleeve at that. The empathy is overflowing. There is such celebration of the indomitable spirit of the Latin American immigrant, their success despite hardship. The Reyes family are supportive, sweet, loving and unashamed of their specific cultural identity. Apparently James Gunn did not have a huge amount of input on this, but this does work well as a lead in to his handling, aka the DCU: it cares deeply about its characters and ensures you do as well, there are great needle drops, and it really makes you care about someone that a lot of people currently do not.I would say about a third of the quick fire jokes should have been trimmed out. There are times where it really feels like they're jingling keys in your face. The fairly frequent, fun if not always the most creative action features a lot of CG, and though it's definitely better than the Flash and Ant-Man 3, it's especially helped by the fact that this was clearly shot on actual locations and physical sets, not surrounded by green screen screens or on the volume. They actually did toss a stunt person through the air, that car was actually knocked over, etc.Some of the violence in this really pushes the PG-13, and though there's not a huge amount of moderate to strong language in English, note that anyone speaking Spanish will pick up on some swearing there. I recommend this to any fan of comic books and the films adapting them. 7/10.","8/10"

"Blue Beetle","kuner-59029","18 August 2023","After the midly amusing The Flash, this is the final DCEU movie. The trailer looked bad already, but the final film is a boring mess. Blue beetle is generic, unoriginal paint by numbers superhero filmmaking, the 100% regurgitation of the same old tired formula. The story is basically ""Spiderman, but boring"".The hero is boring, the villain even more so, so they decided to make this some kind of ensemble movie with a quirky sitcom family. It doesn't work. Everyone tries to hard to be funny and likeable, that it feels faker than politicians smiling.In many ways, this is the filmic equivalent to the scene in Joker where he gets up on a comedy stage and tries in vain to make people laugh. It's sad. It's a waste of everyone's efforts and talents.Just let the superhero genre die already. Batman and Spiderman have some great story potential, but the rest is just played out. There's nothing more to be squeezed out of the genre.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","Garcwrites","16 August 2023","It became increasingly obvious that Blue Beetle was designed to be a fun family film with maybe the younger members of the family in mind. It's not quite a Spy Kids movie but it's close. A young adult version if you will. Don't get me wrong I love the Spy Kids movies for what they are and this movie made me think of them, but a grown-up version. Blue Beetle has heart, the emotion - I teared up a few times, - and the family dynamic is...great. It's a joyous movie that celebrates Latin culture well, but it falters when it comes to the superhero side of things, mainly the villain's goal and that he's fighting another version of himself.The violence and the softened but still gory on-screen deaths would be the things that make this Spy kids-like movie - to keep the previous example - more adult but it's the performances that make it so, except for one. Uncle Rudy was too much, he was in a low-budget Spy Kids movie, while the others weren't. It was so jarring. He was so grating for me that I was tensed whenever he was on screen, which was a lot. It's like he's trying to be the main character in this movie instead of the supporting. Not everything he says or does is cringe but enough to be worrying once the pattern was identified and there's two third of the movie to go. I don't know if it's the casting, the direction, or the script, maybe all three but Uncle Rudy was not it, not the secret sauce. He really brought this movie down for me. This role could have been played differently. He's being a caricature when the others are desperately trying not to be. I'm not hating on him but him being the main thing that doesn't quite work in the movie is pretty good in my book.Xolo, Bellissa, and Bruna really shine in this movie as do most of the Reyes family cast, they made me care about the family and what happens. Xolo is a great Jaime, I'm most familiar with the character from Young Justice but I recognized him in Xolo. Belissa as Jaime's sister was amazing, she seamlessly brought the dry humor and the sadness, she didn't lose me once. Bruna is a great find and this is probably the role that I'll recognize her from.Blue Beetle is entertaining and fun, a good time at the cinema, yet just shy of being great.@garcwrites.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","reddiemurf81","27 December 2023","Jaime Reyes returns to his family home after graduating with a degree in pre-law, looking forward to a break before heading to law school. However, upon his return he discovers his family (his mother & father, sister, nana, and his conspiracy theorist Uncle Rudy) is going through a rough time financially, and facing eviction. So, rather than going back to school, he ops to find work so he can assist his family.While Jaime and his sister are working at a local resort, the lovely young Jenny Kord (whose family owns/operates ones of the largest corporations in world) catches his eye. After coming to her defense, and getting fired for his troubles, Jenny offers her number to him and how she may be able to get him a job with her family's company.So the next day, Jaime goes to see Jenny Kord to inquire about a possible job. When he finds her, she appears rather stressed/panicked, and upon seeing Jaime, she hands him a box, telling him that his first job is to guard the contents of the box with his life, and not to open it.Well,, these events lead Jaime Reyes down a path he, or his family, never saw coming.After seeing the trailer, and hearing bad reviews, I was very much prepared to not like this movie at all. However, I really enjoyed it! It is in no way perfect or groundbreaking, but it is a good, fun movie. Very much a departure for DC (it didn't really feel like
DC at all. At least not the one I'm used to. #restorethesnyderverse)Family is very much at the heart of the movie, and that's a really wonderful thing to see. The cast is really good (George Lopez plays the cooky Uncle really well and brings lols).There are cliches, and it is predictable, and there are some things said/eluded to that I didn't care for,, but all around it a fun ride, and I'd like to see a sequel.","3/10"

"Blue Beetle","maxwelloreocookie","20 August 2023","I REALLY wanted to like this movie, despite hearing a lot of people say it's mid or bad, and constantly hearing it's gunna bomb at the box office. Despite hearing all that constantly, I still tried to go in with a clear open-mind, and I was still disappointed.It's been said a million times before because it's true, but this is an EXTREMELY cliched super hero origin movie. The super cliched plot wouldn't be as bad if the characters and humor hit better, but that sadly isn't the case either.The humor for me just didn't hit whatsoever for me like 90percent of the time. Some of the humor is SUPER corny, and I generally don't mind corny humor, but the corny humor in this movie just takes it to a WHOLE Nother LEVEL! There's good corny and there's bad corny, this is bad corny, which doesn't even bring a little smirk on my face. The suspension of disbelief they pull just for a cheap unfunny joke is lowkey insulting.Xolo Mariduena is the best part of the movie, He's my second favorite character on Cobra Kai, the first being William Zabka. It's too bad Xolo was given a bad movie to work with, he's very charismatic and see great acting potential in him, but he just isn't given enough material to show that with this movie, could've made him funnier or at least give him a real arc. Jamie Reyes/Blue Beetle doesn't even have a real character arc. I guess his arc is he loves his family, then by the end, he still loves his family? Huh? I guess he has this super random thing that he's against killing, but I thought that was so dumb and unnecessary to include in the movie. Obviously killing innocent people is wrong, but killing people who are trying to kill innocent people isn't that bad. Plus after his anti-killing scene, it's barely ever mentioned again and this message really goes nowhere, so why was it ever mentioned in the first place? The movie would've been better if the ""no killing thing"" was just never bought up. And the no-killing thing just makes Xolo look like an idiot. The ""no killing"" message made sense in a movie like Terminator 2 for example because it's a huge part of the overall narrative of the movie, but here, it doesn't really do anything, so why is it here?The two main villains are super cliche,"" Your family is what makes you weak!"" Give me a break, seems like this movie was made for 10-year-olds. It's just SO BASIC and cliche that it's corny. Susan Sarandon completely phones in her role too, but I don't blame her because she is given nothing to work with. We all know Susan Saradon is a seasoned actor and clearly knows how to act, so she obviously chose not to even try in this movie, because she knows there is nothing to work with.The ""girlfriend"" is probably the worst actor in the movie. I supposed she's supposed to be the ""love interest?"" But huge quotations on that because she's really bland and has zero chemistry with Xolo. She's more like an AI exposition dump, and that's it.The action was overall just decent. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's barely just good either. It could've been way better, and Xolo barely used any cool stuff with the powers he has. This is not a spoiler because it's in the trailer, but he makes a Final Fantasy sword, this was kinda cool, but it seems random in the context of the movie. It would've been cooler and made more sense if the movie showed he was a big gamer or Final Fantasy fan earlier in the movie, and could've used other video-game weapons. And would've been kinda a cool, unique, and relatable thing for a young adult to do. But this movie only shows Mexicans liking stereotypical Mexican stuff, can't be more unique and show Mexicans liking other things like Final Fantasy, anime, or video-games in general.I'm just sad because we don't get a lot of Mexican superheroes, so they should've put way more effort into this movie if they wanted it to be successful, but they didn't. The lack of quality in the movie shows it. You just can't be super pro-diversity, then when finally get a chance to make a big-budget Hispanic movie, you made a below-mediocre mess of a movie. Whoever wrote and directed this movie just ruined it for more diversity movies in the future. And I know the writer and director of this movie are both Hispanic, so I don't get why didn't they try harder??!?!!?! They should've tried harder or the main studio should've hired writers and directors with more talent and/or cared more.I just wiki'd who directed and wrote this movie, and the director only has 2 movies before this I never heard of. They should've hired a way more experienced director. As for the writer, he DOESN'T even have a wiki page!!! WOW! So your telling me the studios hired some guy to write this movie has no prior movie writing experience or even show writing experience in his whole life?!?!?! Why was he hired?!?!? No wonder the writing is so bad, and I know there can still be studio inference as well, but we still deserved at least a competent writer for this movie.This was my last hope for the DC cuz 90percent of their movies are awful, and they recently keep just making flop after flop and it's easy to see why. It BLOWS MY MIND how one of the richest studios struggles to make a single good movie when they have WAY MORE resources than 90% of other movie companies. They can't even decide if this movie is part of the rebooted DCU or not. How about this, you'd never have to worry about rebooting your series in the first place if you just consistently made good movies like youre supposed to! Making good movies should ALWAYS be at the top of your list.","10/10"
"Blue Beetle","rannynm","16 August 2023","I really love the film Blue Beetle! One thing I enjoy is the strong cultural theme at its center. It is a great sci-fi film, with a great tone and some pretty fun comedic scenes and characters, which is different for a DC movie.The storyline is set in Palmera City where Jamie Reyes (Xolo Maridue√±a), a Gotham pre-law graduate, is trying to get a job. When he meets Jenny Kord (Bruna Marqueszine), she gives him a piece of alien technology called the ""Scarab"" that gives him superpowers. The plot thickens when a woman named Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) tries to steal the Scarab back from Jamie, putting his entire family in danger.The storyline is great. What this story does differently than other superhero movies is make the main character's family a big part of the action. There are a lot of other unique things about this film, too. I love the way the director and writers bring representation of Latino culture into the film through the characters and the sets. Palmera City, Jamie's house and Jamie's family all feel very realistic. The costumes are incredible as well, especially the Blue Beetle suit-it's slick and has a personality of its own. Of all the characters, my favorite is Rudy (George Lopez), who brings a lot of fun into his scenes. He is the 'tech support' for Jamie, but is also a conspiracy theorist, and there are a lot of jokes based on his quirky personality. The makeup effects are great too; for example the scene where Jamie transforms into the Blue Beetle.The film's message is that family makes you stronger, not weaker, which is a theme I love. Be forewarned that the film has a few violent scenes, a lot of action, some profanity and sexual references.I give Blue Beetle 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases in theaters on August 18, 2023. By Connor S., KIDS FIRST!","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","eoinageary","18 August 2023","So Blue Beetle is definitely fun, I'm not sure if it's as amazing as people are making it out to be but it's a fun movie and a solid introduction.The story is about Jaime ( Hi May ) who comes in contact with the Scarab and turns him into the Blue Beetle. His family are under threat as Cord Industries want the Scarab back, He must become one with the Blue Beetle and fight for his family and his freedom.The family element is really good, usually they say it's family oriented and there a joke or 2 but family is at the heart of the movie and the stand outs for me is NANNA the goat, a caring figure and a bada$$, the uncle is also great, he has some funny likes but his overall character works.Blue Beetle himself is really enjoyable, the movie is fine to be honest it's an origin story. Not man of those are AMAZING but his personality and likeness pulls the movie. Good action scenes and I love the suit, overall a good movie definitely worth watching and I'm looking forward to more Jamie. 2 post credits, the end one not worth it, it's a joke hahah 7.5/10.","3/10"
"Blue Beetle","AreSee5454","28 December 2023","One of the biggest question in the movie - Why did the scarab chose Jaime? - is never answered. And IMO, makes the movie even worst for it.Why does it make the movie worst?The scarab didn't chose Ted Kord, a man who was very intelligent (I'm assuming since he built all those futuristic technology) and was altruistic (fighting crime even without superpowers).But instead chooses Jaime, why? Because he is...naive? He doesn't want to hurt people with a deadly weapon but doesn't think that people being smashing into objects in high speed aren't going to die due to brain hemorrhage or internal bleeding?Unathletic? The guy barely has any muscle tone; at least Andrew Garfield was cut for The Amazing Spiderman.Weak-minded? Khaji-Da did 90% of all the fighting!!!The only reason I can use as a rational on why the scarab would choose Jaime was because of the latter. She could control and eventually overtake Jaime's body and mind because he was weak.Even Jenny would be more ""worthy"" of the scarab over Jaime.Pros:
+ Bruna Marquezine - sorry, but having some eye helped with the stupidity. However, her exaggerated man-spread when introducing her character was not attractive.Con: (outside of what others have already brought up)
Weapon tech company uses simple guns to fight? Even the fortified island didn't have any weapons for a possible sea or air assault.Carapax fight better with a less overpowering suit?Poor family losing their home all have the newest iPhones, a (poor taste) tricked-out Yota, and expensive taste for shoes. It's funny thatthere are at least 4 abled working people in the house and they still can't pay the house bill?High tech company leaves the most important tech in its entire history alone in a room with no camera, security, or security measures. The same building doesn't up security and lets the building get infiltrated again because El Chapulin playing in the security camera is not too much of a concern to lock down the entire building. But then again, when they did lockdown the building the first time in the beginning they allowed all sorts of people to leave willy-nilly.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","GhostFoxX","19 September 2023","Anyone who follows DC or even comics as a whole, knows how promising of a character Blue Beetle is in the comics-verse. Guy has been a featuring member of Teen Titans for decades, holding his own as one of the coolest drawn characters that has a very interesting backstory regarding an alien symbiote. The character had immense potential to be turned into a promising live-action film-series out of it. And frankly speaking, I think the cast choice was good as well - they could've pulled off the hype. The only thing that ruined this film, however, is the writing. It's terrible - felt so rushed and low-depth at some points that you'd feel like pausing to not continue watching anymore. CGI was bad for some parts too, but that can still be overlooked as most of it gets the job done quite well. But the writing, man, it's awful. DCU won't have much to build on if they continue doing such pathetic job at writing stories like this.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","claszdsburrogato","7 November 2023","DC has not been having a good year with the films released in 2023. Blue Beetle is everything we've seen before, further reinforcing this tired and repetitive formula. This film again falls into the line of mediocrity, making it forgettable. The whole look of the film doesn't please me, it's sickening to see these extravagant lights and this soulless technology. The humor is forced in many moments and apparently the script doesn't realize this. They repeat the same jokes all the time trying to get at least one laugh, it seems like they try to make the joke stand out, but it's just unbearable every time it occurs. It's unbearable having to talk all the time about films like Blue Beetle. It doesn't deliver anything new or striking, not even striking in a bad way. The only thing that can be taken away from two hours of film is the Latin representation, which is indeed important, but at certain moments they manage to force even that, returning to stereotypes.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","shovon-1","4 November 2023","What was this movie actually about? Mexican immigrants and their sob story in the United States? I just could not grasp WB's plot here at all. Was I watching a superhero movie or a mash-up of Power Rangers mixed with Bollywood emotions among a group of Spanish-speaking immigrant people who think doing education brings you in debt ? I was completely alienated from the plot, story, and the general content. If immigration sob stories are what WB wants to delve into, they might as well make a documentary rather than enticing potential customers with this worthless content. My two hours, or whatever, lost into a worthless oblivion.","8/10"
"Blue Beetle","klchu","20 August 2023","As a far of Blue Beetle from Young Justice we were excited to see this movie. For the most part this is a success and the movie has a good heart and cast. If you have ""super hero fatigue"" this movie won't help but it does change things up a little.First the weak points: Not the best villain, but at least a believable one. The pacing of the movie could also be a little tighter. There are a few scenes which probably should be been DVD extras.The strong points: A decent cast who all get meaningful things to do. The core messages are good, but perhaps not original. Still, well-done tropes are still enjoyable. The SPX are very good. Most of the suit is practical effects so they look real and there isn't CGI overload.This is definitely an ""upper tier"" DC superhero movie. I hope they make a sequel.","8/10"
"Blue Beetle","demonblade-37792","18 August 2023","This is a great way to start off Blue Beetle (2023)! The first impression is that it had good jokes that I laughed along with. The whole movie revolves around a comedy-action movie so there was plenty of jokes to go around with. The acting was great with everyone especially Jamie Reyes/Blue Beetle (Xolo Mariduena) making him a likable protagonist. George Lopez playing as Uncle Rudy was my favorite character because he was basically the comedian of the movie. It was glad to see him back on the big screen. The cinematography with the special effects and CGI was good of Blue Beetle himself and there was a lot of blue and purple color schemes going on. It was fresh to see an old DC character getting his own movie. Director Angel Manuel Soto does a great job of portraying Blue Beetle's origin story off to the world. Overall, Blue Beetle is great with its acting, jokes, and action. I would recommend watching it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","masonsaul","18 August 2023","Blue Beetle is a very generic comic book movie that doesn't do much that's new however thanks to a core focus on family and groundbreaking representation that informs and enhances every decision made it remains a really good comic book movie and definitely one of DC's better films from their recent output.Xolo Mariduena is charisma incarnate here, Jaime is so loveable and leads the film effortlessly. Adriana Barraza, Dami√°n Alc√°zar, Elpida Carrillo, Belissa Escobedo and especially George Lopez are a great supporting cast with a believable heartwarming family dynamic.Susan Sarandon could've been a delightfully evil, scenery chewing villain but unfortunately she isn't given much and ends up being completely forgettable. Raoul Max Trujillo isn't much better until some very last minute flashbacks that do actually completely change the character for the better.√Ångel Manuel Soto doesn't do a lot to bring his own style to this genre but any and all flourishes of blue neon are greatly appreciated and the hand to hand combat is really fun. The music by Bobby Krlic is one of the most unique superhero scores thanks to its synth style which works well for this character.","8/10"
"Blue Beetle","theffachrif","25 September 2023","Directed by Angel Manuel Soto, the story follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridue√±a) as he searches to find purpose in the world after just graduated from college, but suddenly life throws a curve ball when he unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab chooses Jaime to be its host, he is bestowed with an incredible range of superpowers and weaponry.I get it, resetting what is already a risky and messy cinematic universe is a risky move, especially since opening it by introducing a quite unpopular character for the wider audience. But man I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't enjoy this one, it's a fresh and solid start if not a great one. It's slick, fun, and packed with emotions, while this type of origin story isn't new in the superhero genre but there's something special about Blue Beetle's central plotline. It's about the power of family's love and support also acceptance of what destiny has given to us, sometimes it doesn't meet our expectations, and sometimes it's exceeded it more than we can imagine. We can see it from Jamie's character developed throughout the story, actually not just him but also his family. Life after college isn't what he's imagined, Jamie even said he failed the family and it just gets worse when the scarab chooses him. He couldn't grasp the reality of it at first, but he slowly embraced it, Jamie is destined to be their hero, to be bigger than he had hoped for.I never see Maridue√±a's prior work, but he's certainly the right guy for the role. He delivers a joyful and honest performance, not to mention the rest of the cast who played the family, their chemistry natural and strong. George Lopez' Uncle Rudy is probably my second favorite, The dude is literally a comic relief. I'm not a big fan of the villains in this movie, there's nothing really special other than they play an important part in the story, obviously. I think they are sort of merely a threat, Susan Sarandon's performance isn't bad though. It's crazy that the CGI is way better and cleaner than The Flash, which has more budget than this movie. Both of the suits are practical but, once again, the Blue Beetle is definitely superior. The first suit-up looks terrifyingly awesome.Blue Beetle is a promising start for the DCU.","3/10"
"Blue Beetle","TomTalksFilms","20 August 2023","Another day and another superhero film graces the big screen. This time it's DC with a film that feels like a cheap spider-man rip off without any of the interesting bits.Xolo Mariduena plays a young Mexican guy who's just returning home to his family after becoming the first of his family to graduate from college. Like many of us he finds himself jobless and it debt and now the pressures on as the rent for the family home is about to be tripled. What follows is a story about how a guy who's down on his luck mistakenly unleashes the power of the blue beetle and as we all know with great power comes great responsibility which is a quote that maybe Hollywood execs need to start putting into practice with how they treat their writers.The film is about as formulaic as it could be with every single Mexican stereotype forced in there often in the form of jokes that rarely land. I appreciate seeing diversity in my films but Mexican please let me know are you happy with how you're being represented because I wouldn't be if I were you?The films tone doesn't even feel like that of a DC film it's strangely light hearted to the point where it at times feels like a parody of a superhero film. This becomes an even bigger issue when the film throws in some emotional scenes as they have no affect on an audience as they feel so out of place with the light hearted nature of the rest of the film.I tried to stick with this one for as long as I could and there was a scene in the middle between the main character and his uncle (who by the way is by far the best character) where I felt the film may be about to pick up. This wasn't however the case and for the last 45 minutes I found myself on my phone and I can't say I've been this bored with a film since Ant Man Quantumania. Whilst I know this film isn't apart of the new phase of DC I do worry what may happen to the state of their productions in the hands of James Gunn who has publicly defended this film.For me it's the worst film of the year so far.","10/10"
"Blue Beetle","GusherPop","17 August 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is a new DC movie that follows the box office success of ""Shazam!"" and ""The Flash."" The film stars Xolo Maridue√±a as a young superhero and is rated PG-13. The film is inspired by Latin culture and follows the story of a 22-year-old Mexican college grad with a cool family. Director √Ångel Manuel Soto's fantasy adventure is familiar to fans of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming,"" ""Black Panther,"" and ""Iron Man,"" but features a main character's superteam instead of Batman and Wonder Woman. Jaime Reyes returns to Palmera City after graduating with a degree but faces a difficult situation as his parents, Rocio and Alberto, have shut down their auto shop and are about to lose their house in a gentrified area. Jaime meets Jenny Kord, who volunteers to help him find a job. However, things take a strange turn when Jenny gives Jaime a blue scarab, a valuable piece of alien biotechnology. Jaime takes the bug out of its box, and the otherworldly entity chooses him as a host, giving him a supersuit and cool abilities. ""Blue Beetle"" takes a Spider-Man comic playbook approach, putting Jaime through the wringer with his new powers, accidentally cutting a bus full of people in half, and even going to space. Maridue√±a's performance in the learning-to-be-a-superhero scenes is likable, allowing viewers to understand Jaime's strengths and insecurities. The world begins to fall apart as Victoria seeks Jaime to remove alien tech from his body. Jaime's openness to love adds humor and young-adult hormones. DC has had some crummy supervillains in recent years, and Sarandon's antagonist is one of the better examples. Victoria wants the scarab to help her create a One Man Army Corps of souped-up soldiers, including Carapax, a character tied to the controversial real-life School of the Americas. Jaime takes Victoria on with the help of his family, including his Nana, sister Milagro, and Uncle Rudy. Jaime's loving relatives ground his story and add a key sense of representation. The film's plot is grounded in the love and loyalty of Jaime's family, making it a relatable and entertaining story. ""Blue Beetle"" is a comic book series that features Jaime's transformation into a body horror character, blending lively personalities with a deep comic book mythology. The story revolves around Jenny's missing dad Ted Kord, the previous Blue Beetle. As the DC universe undergoes changes, fans can expect more of Jaime in the upcoming reset, highlighting the ongoing flux in the character. ""Blue Beetle"" is a politically spry film that explores the ills of white-American imperialism through the love and loyalty of its characters. The villain, Victoria, is a metaphor for the past and present, while the hero, Love, triumphs over self-discovery. The film's comedy focuses on how these characters mesh, rather than low-hanging memeification, and the family-bound narrative is pure and pure. ""Blue Beetle"" is a superhero film by Soto that despite its unremarkable action sequences, it still maintains vigor due to an entertaining ensemble. Adriana Barraza delivers punchlines, while George Lopez as Uncle Rudy delivers animated pratfalls and one-liners. The film's strength comes from its family, making it an enriching experience at the movies. Although it may not break the mold, it does break expectations. ""Blue Beetle"" is a film directed by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, which focuses on convenience and convenience. The story revolves around Jenny stealing a blue scarab, which Victoria uses to develop super-soldiers. Jenny then smuggles it into Jaime's hands, who is unaware of the scarab. Jaime becomes symbiotically linked to the scarab and gets a blue suit. The film's weakest components are the inarticulate composition of the characters, with the villain Victoria being portrayed as a stoic henchman. The film also lacks chemistry between Jenny and Jaime, partly due to Marquezine's overacting and overacting. The film's plot is a mix of nonsensical events and smart beats, but it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling story.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","MovieNinjaGuy","21 August 2023","I had low expectations of this film.I don't ask for much with movies, just for them to be mildly entertaining at minimum and have some heart. All the talk about bad CGI in the likes of The Flash I don't care about so much. I thought that particular movie was fine. Fun, had decent heart and some likeable characters scattered about who are at least trying to do things to move the story forwards.Blue Beetle however, is as bad as things can become I think when it comes to superhero movies. We have seen some terrible entries in the Marvel space recently as well with Thor 4, Dr Strange 2 and Black Panther 2 being very poor. Strange story choices, terrible villains and bad resolutions. In all 3 of those films the main super heroes are almost just background characters and no longer the focus.Blue Beetle is on that terrible level and this film makes even less sense I have to say and again the main superhero is relegated to be less important than he ought to be for some reason.Every character seems so unlikeable, except for the father. The sister talks about taking a big dump at her cleaning job after we first hear how the family struggles financially. Charming. The grandma ends up with a higher kill count than the super hero. The uncle is a computer wizard who drives a big truck but still can't help the family keep their home.This whole family, who can't make end's meet but who can do everything else when it suits the story just doesn't work in a superhero film. It is not convincing. Story wise I think it is fine/good if they can be there for support and guidance. But to physically take over I think is a crazy approach that doesn't land well at all, especially when the best person out of that bunch is the one who dies before all that takes off.After the father's death the family straight away uses all the abandoned (supposedly) Blue Beetle related gear as in a sort of kitted out ready to go endless Batcave supply. But then we also find out the original Blue Beetle host who that all belong to is still alive in the mid credits scene? Why are we doing any of this? It is all so dumb and never focuses on what the current Blue Beetle superhero could do for humanity.Susan Sarandon, as the baddie, phones in her performance to make things worse. An utterly pointless villain who has some vague mission to make her robot army more of a robot army with the Blue Beetle scarab thing.Furthermore, early on, we find out that the Blue Beetle suit / scarab that gets fused with our hero's body can actually run on auto pilot. So what is the reason to keep the host conscious in that case? The suit seems to make better decisions early on whilst the host succeeds in convincing it to stop it from killing baddies, who then when still alive cause his father's heart attack and death.Compare that badly thought out drivel to the excellent story in the original Superman movie where Superman can't save his father from a heart attack death. He has all these powers but couldn't do that. Reality sinks in and it makes him more determined. There is no such character arc here at all.I didn't like any of what was presented in Blue Beetle story wise or character wise. There isn't 1 thing I can tell you I liked.There have been far better small budget movies this year that should have enjoyed more popularity over this endless superhero nonsense in which we constantly have to put up with lower quality story telling and horrible characters. Some good films I saw recently this year that may have gone unnoticed are: Talk to Me & Sisu. If you're after a big movie go see Gran Turismo.Look for those and give this tripe a miss.It has not been a bad year for movies I think and this hopefully is as low as it can go cinema wise.","9/10"
"Blue Beetle","torgis","18 August 2023","I watched the trailer and thought it told the whole movie; corny and cookie cutter, nothing spectacular. I know there is a ton of bias going into this with people assuming DC this and Gunn that, but this movie was so much more enjoyable to watch than expected and I was pretty happy with it.Yes, there are a few phrases that feel forced and would fit into the cookie cutter superhero flick. However, that only really happened 2-3 times. The tech shown in the movie was so incredibly fun and the suit - AMAZING. The quality of that suit is what got me in the theatre in the first place and it did not disappoint.It was a really fun movie (without spoiling it), it was not a replication of another, it had some fun characters (and one or two I wasn't a fan of, some moments of not great acting, but it wasn't a massive budget to begin with). Actually teared up at one point (okay, maybe 2).The best way to enjoy this movie is to get out of your own head with the expectations and inter-connectivity of the films and weird sensitivities. I saw another review mentioning the ""fascist"" comment - as a big fan of the character referenced, I still laughed out loud hearing it because it fits the wild energy of the character that said it (clearly intended as a joke). There's no secret agenda, it's a fun movie for a more obscure character, and I had a blast watching it. Went in thinking it wasn't going to be worth the money, but was pleasantly surprised and look forward to watching it again.","8/10"
"Blue Beetle","rgkarim","19 August 2023","LIKES:The Music:
-A simple like for some, the music has a bit of a mixture that is fun, toe tapping, and representative of the moment.-Hispanic raps and ballads have melodrama and that spice at moments with their catchy beats and vocals.-Other songs are that hip hop attitude that comes at the perfect moment to go with the impressive action and training moments. Really pushing the boundaries
-And the symphony songs are quite impressive when they come out in key moments.The Comedy:
-A big selling point, Blue Beetle is a lot of slapstick and jokes that might get excessive for some.-If you are Hispanic and have the relevance, it makes the comedy even better, as the cultural references are a deck of cards lined to be a winning hand.-While others are less specific, with great execution, timing, and quirkiness that I had fun with when it all came together.-And those who like uncoordinated tripping, stumbling, and accident prone comedy work to help raise the torch.-While not the most unique, it works for a comic book movie and has a place with a lot of other elements in this movie.The Story:
-The movie works to add elements that are good for an origin movie trying to reset a big universe.-We have a character arc, some tragic events to put pressure to meet them, a few representable villains, and the growing pains coming with the new power.-It has enough of these elements to blend mostly well, and I enjoyed a lot of the building this movie did with elements that have emotion, growth, and fire that I want in these movies.-And throw everything together within two hours to give you a concise story that is not too convoluted or thought provoking.The Acting:
-It's a comic book movie, and though we have seen monuments to the acting trade in some other films worthy of pedestal raising.-This movie is not bad, in fact good, for what I call the standard way of comic book movies, with a cast that is likeable, feels like a family, and has a bit more realistic feel.-Becky G's voice is not so much singing, and her new interaction as the Beetle's brain is funny, robotic, and near the end shows elements similar to Jarvis.-Bruna Marquezine has a commanding prowess to her. A balanced array of strength and vulnerability, matched with a real character that works well with the various groups she has to be with.-And Xolo Mariduena the lead is sensational. He's funny, charming, delivers his awkward young adult lines well, but grows into some more engaging moments that match the early days of Marvel and D. C. movies.-And George Lopez is... well Lopez. He works as both comedic relief and a good plot device, which might be annoying and old cad to some, but again holds merit in this movie and build up.The Effects... to some degree:
-The effects are what you expect in this movie, and DC continues to put out some impressive moments that worked for me.-Seeing the Blue Beetle fly, alongside his fighting mechanics was good for CGI to most degrees.-Fluid animation, good shifting changes using hard light technology, and a few other things that made the currently impossible, possible.-And with explosions and fires having some practical effects helps further blending of the worlds make it a little easier on the fakeness.The Action:
-It's a little meager to start with as the suit gets time to adjust, but once it does... I was happy.-Blue Beetle has several varieties of action to it, utilizing the start of the abilities and adding a little strategy to the mix up.-Impressive blasting, some good choreography, and helping add a little physical combat offered some mix up to the moments, and with the other things mentioned work to craft a comic worthy battle.-Good cinema alongside adding story elements to it only further enhanced the experience for me, and made most of the fighting in the small time.DISLIKES:The Comedy a Tad Excessive:
-If you have a high tolerance or an attitude of never enough comedy, you'll have no beef with this category.-For me, there are times where the emotional moments and developments are overtaken by another Spanish driven rant, or another screaming bout.-It gets a little tiresome to hear Lopez cry and scream at every other word of his, but it's not the worst compared to some of the other movies I've seen with overutilization.Predictable Story:
-I know that originality is tough to acquire these days, but this movie was very easy to guess what was happening.-Foreshadowing paints an obvious direction this film is going and it takes some of the twists and surprise that you might want in a film like this and an edge.-It all ties up about as I expected, and I think could be part of the boring part that people talk about in their reviews.The Visuals Dip Into Mediocre At Times
-I know this isn't meant to be the most realistic of movies, but Blue Beetle does things well for the most part.-However, there are times that the movie sort of dips in the frame rates and smoothness and gets lost in the hokey fake tones.-Blue Beetle has some polishing to do if they get the okay for a second movie. Maybe a little more blending of the real and the CGI to help blend things. Alongside some better depth and details.-Again, it's not as big for me for most of the movie, but there are some times where post editing was a tad too inconsistent.More Action At The End With Other Characters:
-There is a part where the movie is about planning out the final battle well and using the players.-They kind of do this, but it's underwhelming and used more comedically than that cool finesse to the grand finale.-Blue Beetle picks up the slack, but everyone else is kind of a waste when the potential was there to soar or fly like the character.-Given some of the fun aspects they were going to look at, but then just dropped or ran out of time or creativity.-This happens a lot at the end with a lot of characters, and this might be the biggest dislike for me that I hope will expand in the next attempt at the DC universe.The VERDICT:
Blue Beetle is the supposed start to the Gunn universe, and I had a lot of fun with the movie. It's nothing spectacular, mind blowing, earth shattering, or really sand out like they were int eh past, but that doesn't mean it's a throw away movie for me. The film works well with comedy, origin story, and characters, to make an entertaining build of the world and just focusing on the movie itself. While there are hints at what is to come, the movie is trying to just be a comic book come to life, and bring the punches that comics can only do with a good imagination. And the way they utilize references, technology, and action that I really enjoyed and would have liked a little more of. Yet, the movie is indeed predictable in story terms, a tad excessive at times, and needs some polishing to really hit a consistent B and A gam. Blue Beetle may not be the redefining piece many are still looking for, but it was still a fun incursion with enough gusto to dip into the movie theater. My scores for this piece are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","ifychukwuokafor","21 September 2023","There's no other way to put this but this movie has no business being in the cinema. An absolute waste of 2hrs with a storyline that would make B-rated movies look top tier. The dialogues appear forced and cliche. I can see why it went through development hell for years and I believe it should've remained so.The script felt like it was made for Nickelodeon but somehow managed to find its way to Warner Bros and don't get me started on the action scenes.What a joke.In all, Blue Beetle was set to flop from the beginning - From the cast to the scriptwriting to the obvious CGI, it stood no chance.I'd not recommend this unless you've got time to burn.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","namob-43673","18 August 2023","One of the best from DC and kinda endearing. This is cute-ish, and if this movie had came out 25 years ago we would probably be pretty happy with it. But this is a C-movie, and it does not cut it today, and being cute is not enough to win over viewers.I have not liked a single one of the DC movies. Not even one. A couple of them have been watchable if you have had a few, and this is in that same general area of ""entertainment"". If you'd been gobbling down a 6-pack and a couple of shots, and you have a soft spot for cheesy cliche 1990s superhero movies than you might enjoy this. If you want quality, originality, good writing, good CGi and other things that make a good movie than this is not for you.There are a few cool moments, a few laughs, a couple of scenes which is good, and the music score is pretty nice. But other than that this is simple, perhaps something cute, something old-timey flashback but also so cliche so you know what is going to happen from start to finish, but yea, so what? You have seen this a million times, why not a million and one time? You could actually do worse. So if you are a big fan of the character, you might even find this to be good or great.I give this a very generous 4/10. Which I believe is the second highest I have given to the DC movies. And the reason is I do not think I wasted my money. Despite the score this is endearing and cute and sort of fun. But anyone claiming this is a good movie is delusional. This does not suck, but it does stink and you should be aware.","1/10"

Like stinky cheese without the cheese.Character building is so bad that it passes through all phases. They're funny, serious, genius, dumb,... all together!Plot holes? Numerus. No, not numerus, too many to count!Logic holes are expected in a ""super hero"" movie. I am not talking about logic holes but about plot holes. Can't explain more without making a spoiler.Special effects? Perfect.Acting? No problem.Direction? ...Oh boy!

"Blue Beetle","sherjan-aamir","17 August 2023","Blue Beetle works well for what it is trying to be, a fun time a the movies that you won't be thinking about once you leave but during the time you're watching it, it'll keep you engaged and entertained for its runtime. The family dynamic works wonderfully and while a few moments can be a bit on the ""childish humour"", most of it came off as charming to me. In tone, it's the closest to the first Shazam film and a similar degree in quality as well. The suit looks great, the fight scenes are cool and the story is unfortunately, generic. The niche fanbase of Blue Beetle will definitely enjoy this one as it is one of the better DC heroes debut and a much big screen debut than a certain other, much popular hero dressed in red who runs fast. If you'd have told me a few years earlier that I'd have a significant better time with this than a Flash film, I would have called you crazy but here we are...","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","mattaaron","18 August 2023","This might be the worst Superhero film I've ever seen, extremely cheesy, action is low budget and actors did an okay job. Definitely geared towards children (like the fart scene).This is supposed to be the 1st film of the new DC/James Gunn universe, which is really disappointing.I noticed a ton of action/sequences that were ripped off from other movies too (Man of Steel, Spider-Man, etc), humor felt very dated and acting felt forced. I had high hopes, trailer looked kind of fun, but the movie went down hill from the start and just got worse and worse.I hope things turn around for DC, I really do.","4/10"

"Blue Beetle","cahidi","9 October 2023","That's the more appropriate title for this movie, cause apparently the Blue Beetle isn't the Scarab. The one which crawled up Jaime's ass wasn't Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle was Jenny's Dad in his superhero form. False title if you ask me. The background story was uninteresting enough to pull the audience in. They should've shown more background on the Scarab. Where does it come from, what it actually is, what's its purpose. It'll give the audience more depth to tune in. The villain has created the bare minimum of threat to anyone to show any significance to be dealt with. So there's one more less reason to watch this movie. Usually Susan Sarandon delivers awesome performance either as an antagonist or protagonist. But in this movie, she kinda hovers around. But I understand that it wasn't her fault. She can only do so much with the script that's given to her. I feel bad for her. But alas, even with the negative reviews I've written, I still can't give it less than 6 stars. Cause at least it's more interesting than Black Widow. And I think the real Blue Beetle is coming in the next installment of this movie. I hope they'll do better next time. I'm giving it another star to give the writers some encouragement.","7/10"

Couldn't you try something different for the villain's motive?I think the end for the superhero movies becomes more clear with every new installment.I'm not asking for you to make a masterpiece but atleast show me that you are trying to provide a work that stands the test of time, I went to watch The Dark Knight just after I finished watching this trash and the difference is absolutely laughable tdk has better visuals and it came out 15 years ago!

"Blue Beetle","sbob322","20 August 2023","If you go in expecting a fun light hearted superhero movie that is what you are going to get. Only complaints are the tonal shifts. His transformation feels like a horror movie transformation and the hero of course doesn't kill people (rolls eyes) but that rule doesn't apply to all the other good guys. They violently kill and make jokes about it. One of its biggest issues is how it is supposed to connect to the DC universe going forward. It doesn't do anything to answer any of those questions. Then there is the racial undertones that seem unnecessary and hurt the movie and again push the us vs them issue instead of trying to unite people. At least it was sort of subtle and could be missed.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","LordJiggy","20 August 2023","A real disappointment. The creators had a ""message"" they wanted to hammer home, and there was this mildly interesting story they decided to hide the propaganda in.The execution had promise, especially with the excellent reactions of the lead actor to being the unwitting/unwilling recipient of a forced integration with the alien life form (think...a nicer version of ""Venom"").Lots of laughs there, but they kept hammering the propaganda into any gap in the CGI action. You know, all the evul white peoples keeping the saintly People of Color down. Because all the people of color were either unappreciated (and unexplained) geniuses, Saints-in-Training, or the Oppressed with Hearts of Gold. Meanwhile the forces of Darkness were part of the white power structure that owned the courts and the police, and were even (SURPRISE SPOILER!) responsible for creating the villain's henchmen.Who could have seen that coming?Man, it was stupid. To say nothing of how the dipshit uncle character (a fitfully funny George Lopez, when the script allowed it) could control an aging superhero's all purposed vehicle just because he was another one of the story's ""Magical Latinos"" and the writers/director were too stupid or lazy to come up with even a minimally logical reason to explain why.Also, the Hero/villian CGI designs owed a LOT to Transformers...they should really cut Michael Bay a check for his stolen creative input.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","Holt344","18 August 2023","Blue Beetle was directed by Angel Manuel Soto and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. I expected this film to be focused on the family side and overall drama of Jaime Reyes' life, mostly because of the film Soto directed, Charm City Kings which was a film I loved. This is a superhero film for the entire family, with themes focusing on family but especially displacement, colonialism, and gentrification in terms of what the director said about the film's themes.For this film and Superhero, I don't have vast amount of knowledge of Blue Beetle except for some comics and especially the Young Justice show and Injustice 2, but this film made a great job at showing the character and hero for a new audience, hopefully even making him into a well known one.An alien scarab chooses college graduate Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the teenager with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle.The film stars Xolo Maridue√±a as Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle alongside Bruna Marquezine, Adriana Barraza, Dami√°n Alc√°zar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon, and George Lopez. Having seen Xolo Maridue√±a in Cobra Kai, I've seen both his capabilities of a dramatic actor and in action sequences, when he was cast in this role I was behind it 100%. Having now seen the film I think he's what makes it decent to good. The costume design was on point, especially the Blue Beetle costume. It's inspired by Young Justice and Injustice 2 along with other versions of the costume. Filming was done mainly at location and with heavy use of practical effects, such as the Blue Beetle suit. The director felt that the use of real-life locations allowed for the practical effects to be better integrated into the movie. Thus making it rely less on CGI and instead of what is best, practical effects. I really liked the action sequences, both how it was shot and edited. I think the film looks really good, great cinematography. I really liked the characters and actors playing them; Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord, Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord and Dami√°n Alc√°zar as Alberto Reyes being three who impressed me.What Blue Beetle does extremely well is how they keep it family-focused and embraces the lore preceding this Blue Beetle, I'm of course talking about Ted Kord and Dan Garrett, the film also have a lot of heart. Critics found it to have plenty of humor and yes it does, but I felt most of the jokes fell flat because of how childish they were then again the majority of the audience was children when I saw it at the cinema. The highlight for me is Xolo Maridue√±a's magnetic performance in the title role, he's just terrific and does such a good job bringing the comic book character to life. The writer and director does too, a very fine bringing the story and origin to life. Blue Beetle is a fun little movie, using each million of its budget to good use, you kind of see why it was supposed to go straight to streaming as it looks quite cheap at times (mostly the antagonist and the visual effects to him, Raoul Max Trujillo as Ignacio Carapax / OMAC). But it's a good film, a good superhero film and worth your time.","1/10"

"Blue Beetle","Imshortok06","19 August 2023","Just saw ""Blue Beetle,"" and it was fantastic! I was pleasantly surprised. Coming in a little skeptical because DC has a few clunkers and feeling a little jaded from superhero movies, I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. ""Blue Beetle"" did what the best superhero movies do: focused on character development and people to root for. I LOVED the cast, from the kind-hearted dad, to the sarcastic sister, to the spunky grandma. The actor who plays the protagonist (love him in Cobra Kai) did such a great job in the lead role. Step aside, Fast and Furious franchise; THIS is how you incorporate a ""family"" theme into your movie. I laughed and I cried several times throughout. While some of the superhero elements have been done before, the blue beetle suit was pretty cool. The soundtrack was good, and Susan Sarandon did a great job as the villain. I have to say that this DC movie is by far better than many of its predecessors.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","skinzilla","20 December 2023","Good special effects but everything else was horrible. First, that family(especially the sister) is one of the most annoying ever put on screen. Whoever tried to write the humor for this movie should stop writing and apply at Walmart or something they are capable of. The plot is dumb, the decisions by characters are idiotic, the movie is full of cliches and familiar tropes and this was an awful representation of Latinos. The death knell for superhero movies is almost complete. DC should just focus on the Peacemaker series and never make another film. This won't bode well for more minority driven blockbusters, that's for sure.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","Jithindurden","20 August 2023","A very generic superhero movie because of how many of these have been coming out and yet it manages to be a fun one with some nice touches in it. The Mexican-American culture feels properly ingrained into it and the comedy works out well because of the heart in it. The lead actor was pretty charming and his family was also really lovely in their roles. The Blue Beetle suit looks incredible because it's mostly an actual suit rather than complete CGI and the hand-to-hand action looks really nifty. The director knows how to properly compose scenes, with proper length in drama and action without chopping them up. But still, the movie is a pretty straightforward superhero origin story with only a few bits and pieces of freshness in it and some tried and tired cliches. Overall, this is only for those who really enjoy superhero films in general. With the superhero fatigue, it's no wonder there were only like 10 people in the theater.","8/10"

The jokes weren't bad. There were a lot of clich√© scenes and themes, but recent superhero movies have been duplicates, but this movie just didn't feel like that to me. Acting was ok. The family was very good and funny. The CGIs were sometimes ok, sometimes bad, but overall I really liked the movie. I really want to watch the second movie of this character.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","kevin_robbins","20 August 2023","Blue Beetle (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters this afternoon. The storyline follows a young man who is returning home from college to find his family struggling. He hopes to use his degree to make enough money to bail out his family. He bumps into a millionaire board member while in the process of losing his job and continues discussions after the interaction. They decide to meet up; and in doing sow, the lady hands him a scarab she doesn't trust her company with. The scarab turns him into a super hero and this is the Blue Beetle Origin Story.This is directed by Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City King) and stars Xolo Maridue√±a (Cobra Kai), Bruna Marquezine (God Save the King), George Lopez (Balls of Fury), Susan Sarandon (Thelma & Luis), Dami√°n Alc√°zar (Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian) and Belissa Escobedo (Hocus Pocus 2).This is a fantastic origin movie. The writing and storyline makes you care about every character in the family...and this movie is really about family at its heart. You genuinely are very invested in what happens to whom. The CGI is top notch and the action scenes are fantastic. Blue Beetle's super powers are well depicted and fun to watch in action. A few scenes reminded me of the video games Soul Caliber and Mortal Kombat. The ending is sad, triumphant and does bring hope. George Lopez is absolutely awesome in this picture and keeps a fun pace to the film with his brand of comedy. Susan Sarandon was also a solid villain.Overall, this is an entertaining origin story and worthwhile addition to the super hero genre. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.","6/10"

"Blue Beetle","shaikhirshad-41223","18 August 2023","Blue Beetle is said to be one of the best DC Family film this year. This movie has everything store for the audience. From Superhero fans to the general family audience all can enjoy this film with a happy face. Movie tells us about the Blue Beetle origin of how a boy from a middle class family gets consulted by a scarab and what situation does he face after getting that scarab into his life.The best thing about this film is it does not focus only on one character and the situation what he face but the whole family gets stucked into it and how they deal with that situation. Family Reunion and the way director has shown the Reyes family was one of the highlight of the film. The origin story doesn't hit you very much as it has same old vibe of origin superhero movies and sometimes you'll also remind some of the comic origin movies that are similar to this film.CGI & Action Sequences are top notch and specially the suit design looks cool and Whenever the suit uses it's different techs while fighting is a treat to watch with perfect cgi elements. XOLO has shined throughout the film and gave the character full justice so as the rest of the cast with acting performance too. Villain is one of the major problem of the superhero films and this film also faces the same issues because it doesn't show or the story justifies the strong villain character and at the end movie becomes average with old typical ending.All n all it's a fresh origin story with amazing cgi shots and action sequences plus a family drama with good acting performances which you can definitely enjoy and give this film a One time watch...","3/10"

The script is bland - a mess of lazy jokes and old tropes we're tired of seeing. There's not very much that sets it apart from other superhero movies. It's dull and cliche.Some of the members of the main family are likable enough, and the death of the father is very emotional, but it's just difficult to care about any of the characters. The leading villain is boring, although her henchman is given a tragic story that makes him the best part of the movie.The action sequences are decently entertaining, but many of the protagonist's exclamations during them just make them annoying. The CGI is also terrible. Blue beetle isn't a boring full, but it's a lackluster one and I wouldn't recommend it.","7/10"

But it got political when it talked about the plight of the poor and Hispanic opposition which was a bit frustrating.Spoilers ahead...They talked about losing their house when Uncle Rudy drove a $60,000.00 truck and had some high tech toys. Ummm could have made bills. Mom, grandma and daughter could have been working? I found that off. I mean, they could have even moved. I was annoyed by that plot narrative.They could have done without the patriarch dying in the plot. He could have been in the hospital recovering and that's where they decided to get Jaime.The dream sequence could have Jaime meeting Ted and Ted saying take care my daughter and done tricks about defeating his sister. That would have been better and nicer.Overall, as an adult, I was bored. But my kids enjoyed it a lot. But they were at the same understanding as me about the whole losing the house thing. They didn't get it either. My family understands hustle to make bills so they though the sister was being lazy.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","claudio_carvalho","30 October 2023","After graduating in the law school, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridue√±a) returns to Palmera City to meet his family, and soon he learns that they are broken and evicted from their home. His sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) gets a cleaning job for him at the mansion of the wealthy Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). However, they are both fired by Victoria when Jaime interferes in a discussion between Victoria and her niece Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine). When Jaime is leaving the house, Jenny asks him to look for her in the Kord Tower for a job opportunity. On the next morning, Jenny learns that her aunt is using an ancient alien Scarab to develop powerful weapons and she steals the artifact. Meanwhile, Jaime is looking for her to get a job, and she uses him to leave the Tower with the scarab hidden in a burger to-go box. His curious Mexican family opens the box and Jaime becomes the host of the alien scarab and they fuse in a powerful weapon. Jaime looks for Jenny to have explanations but he turns into the Blue Beetle. She tells him that they have to remove the device as soon as possible; otherwise, the fusion will be permanent.I had expectations to see ""Blue Beatle"" mainly because of the Brazilian actress Bruna Marquezine in a lead role. However, the film is a great disappointment, with a terrible and long screenplay about another unknown superhero. The silly and ridiculous Mexican family spoils the whole movie with their foolish behavior. It is annoying to hear and see them, and it seems to be a critic to the behavior of Mexican families in particular, and Latin families in general, in a prejudicial view of the author. The humor does not work and it is unfunny actually. And based on the cliffhanger in the credits, it seems that the productors intend to make a sequel. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Besouro Azul"" (""Blue Beetle"")","1/10"

The clich√©s are filled with a movie.There's literally nothing this movie does that other movies haven't done before. Oh the scene where the two love interests are on a bed talking, and they lean in for a kiss, and then just as they're about to kiss... Guess what happens, you're not going to guess it, right? Someone walked in on them and they acted like nothing happened. We haven't seen that one before, right?Oh and if the main character has a good relationship with the family, you probably don't know what will happen with them... Why you didn't even get close to guessing correctly! They get kidnapped by the bad guy! That's a new one, right?That's just two big points. It's just frustrating that writers haven't gotten past the 2000s when it comes to what makes the characters tick and stuff.Oh and Susan Sarandon... Boy oh boy.

From its painfully clich√© dialogue to its cringe-worthy attempts at humor, every scene makes you want to crawl under your seat. The wooden acting and lackluster special effects further cement its status as a cringe fest. The plot, if you can call it that, is a mishmash of tired superhero tropes and predictable twists. The forced romantic subplot is cringe incarnate, with zero chemistry between the leads. Even the costume design seems like a bad cosplay. In a sea of superhero hits, Blue Beetle manages to stand out as a cringe masterpiece that's more likely to induce eye rolls than applause.Dont even go to the movies wait for the digital release

"Blue Beetle","TxMike","4 December 2023","This is an origin story. Set in a fictitious city much of it looks like Los Angeles and the featured family is of Mexican ancestry. In one scene they even warn each other about being discovered as undocumented migrants. But I see much of it was also filmed in Georgia.The featured actor is 21-yr-old Xolo Maridue√±a as Jaime (hy-mee) Reyes, just returning home from college with a degree in Pre-Law. Through a chance encounter with a young lady who happens to be an heir to a wealthy company, he looks her up the next day as she is pilfering a scarab to keep it safe, out of the hands of those who want to use it for harmful purposes.But Jaime gets in the middle of it all, gets the scarab (about the size of a hand) and brings it home in a fast-food box, and is told ""do not open the box, do not touch the scarab.""Of course his crazy family, particularly his sister, violate that instruction immediately, the scarab jumps onto his face, eventually it gets inside him (via his butt-hole?) and quickly he is overwhelmed by powers he has no idea how to control or how to actually use.It is the origin story of a superhero, the Blue Beetle, but frankly it is done in such a silly manner at times, then in a manic style, that for most of its 2-hour running time I was laughing uncomfortably and waiting for a more meaningful story.I don't know why this was made, there really is nothing novel about it. Most of the ""featured"" reviews here are accurate. It is NOT a good movie and I certainly would NOT want to watch it again. At home, with my wife, on DVD from our public library.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","view_and_review","26 February 2024","""Blue Beetle"" wasn't really high on my watch list, if it was on there at all, but, it was a free movie offered in my cruise cabin so why not?The Blue Beetle was a young man named Jaime Reyes (Xolo Mariduena). Like many superheroes he became one quite by accident. He was given a blue scarab beetle in a fast food box and told ""guard it with your life"" but ""don't open it.""Ha! Those are comical instructions for something handed over in a box that a hungry pigeon can open.The person who gave him the mcguffin was Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), the daughter of a wealthy business magnate and member of the Kord family which apparently had their hands in a lot of things including weapons manufacturing.Jaime was going to faithfully follow the instructions given to him by the attractive rich girl, and he would've too had his sister not opened the box. Jaime still lived with his father Alberto (Damian Alcazar), his mother Rocio (Elpidia Carrillo), his abuela (Adriana Barraza), his sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo), and his tio (George Lopez). They were a colorful family that didn't do much to make the movie better. If anything they took credibility away from the movie and made it more like a Sunday morning cartoon.Jaime would have to fight against a Kord super soldier created by the super evil Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). She was so patently evil she also made the movie lack credibility. She was your standard greedy, immoral, anything-for-profit bad guy (or gal).As I was watching the movie all that went through my head was the number of movies I saw in it. There was Iron man, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Venom, and even Robocop 2. ""Blue Beetle"" looked like ChatGBT churned out the script. There were lines from the nemesis like ""your love for your family makes you weak"" which is an oft repeated insult to heroes. And Susan Sarandon's character even said ""the power will be mine"" to Jaime when she captured him. You don't get more generic than that.""Blue Beetle"" had the budget and all the glitter and glitz, but it lacked anything of substance. Even the fact Jaime refused to kill was nothing new or novel.I heard this movie flopped (relative to its budget) and I'm not surprised. DCEU/DCU is pumping out mediocrity all too efficiently. I wonder at what point do they go back to just Batman.","10/10"

It's too bad this movie will be caught up in this reboot storm that is the current DC Universe. Susan Surandon was hilarious as the villain. I would like to see a follow up of some kind just exploring Jaime, and the scarab.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","graykatana","20 September 2023","This might have been marginally toleranle in the 1980's, but is a complete waste of time now.The family is far too loud, pointlessly obnoxious, and far too stupid. In fact, everyone is just too stupid. Combined IQ of all the characters apoears to be 80.Cheezy bad guys, really dumb dialog, uninspired fight scenes. So-so cgi. Just utter drivel. All mportant (and potentially interesting) points ignored entirely or glossed over without follow-up in favor of more obnoxious family stupidity, and more excessive and pointless noise (screaming, yelling, everyone talking at the same time so any conversation is just meaningless noise) Honestly, don't waste your time.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","cruise01","20 August 2023","5 out of 5 stars.Blue Beetle is an awesome superhero film which introduces DC first latino hero. The film has its sense of style and direction. It has plenty of heart, emotions, and action to make this a great film.The plot is great with Jaime (Xolo Mariduena) coming home from college. Only to come across a technology bug that imbedded in him with a suit and powers. While a corporation is after him.Great cast ensemble and a performance lead by Xolo Mariduena. The action sequences are awesome. The visual effects are also good. The humor may be overboard. It is a great Dc film which i loved way more than the Flash. Or if its a start in James Gunns dc universe. The film is off to a great start.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","hiravparekh","19 August 2023","DC Execs to writers : Just take the original Iron Man story and mix in a bit of Ant man and sprinkle a bit of Spiderman and let's call it a day or in this case Blue Beetle.Blue beetle is just a very poor implementation of some of the biggest blockbusters Marvel has given us over the years. There is really nothing good to say about about this movie. Neither the story is good nor the characters. Story as I mentioned is a bad mixture of the marvel movies and so are the characters and the actors. They tried to make the lead actor as close to Peter Parker as possible but he fails to deliver and the same goes for Luis from ant man and wasp character from Ant man.Do yourself a favor and save your time and money and skip this one.","1/10"

"Blue Beetle","panagiotis1993","21 September 2023","My Reaction / Review for Blue Beetle (2023): So Jaime's family is about to lose the house? That sucks. Jaime looks like a very humble guy, I like that. Wait so it was that easy to steal the scarab? Wow, the first time that the scarab connects to Jaime it looks like a freaking horror movie. Why did he have to cut that bus in half, the scarab could easily avoid it, that's very dangerous with so many people in it. The scenes where the scarab gets activated for the first time were pretty fun. Rudy is a bit too much, its like he is screaming for some reason in every scene. So the uncle has some super tech that messes with the electronics and cameras? How convenient.Also they go to Kord industries and there is no serucity or anything? That's dumb. Wait so Carapax has a scarab too or some other technology? First hour is decent, a 6.8/10 I would say, let's see if it gets better or worse. Wow there is no way to get rid of the scarab, its for life, that's kinda cool but at the same time it sucks. The dad is dead? Now its personal. Damn the dad's death made me emotional. Many times they talk in spanish, I would really appreciate some english subtitles but there are none... So now Rudy knows how to fly a spaceship? That's ridiculouus, this man can do anything the plot wants.So now the grandma joins the fight? Cant take this seriously. And now the grandma shot three soldiers, so cringey and ridiculous. The 2nd half is so bad so far. The villain(s) in this movie are so not interesting. OK here is my conclusion. The movie is not bad but it is not great. The whole family thing was too much at some point, the humor is mostly bad, the dialogue could be better, the action scenes mediocre. The only thing I liked was Jaime's character. Overall a mediocre movie, its also like you've seen everything before and very predictable. My final rating is a 6/10.","9/10"

"Blue Beetle","anyanimeotoho","10 September 2023","Blue Beetle does little to impress as far as superhero movies go. Now, we might decide to ""not take it seriously"" and just enjoy the film as a feel-good super-powered adventure, but we've gotten better movies of that nature.For example, DC's very own ""Shazam!"" Interestingly, both films make family a prominent theme in their plot and it proves to be a bankable choice once again. There is a beautiful family dynamic on display here that is hard to deny.The movie falls back on the protagonist's family for most of its comedic content too. However, more often than not, the jokes unfortunately don't land for me. They might come in the form of harmless antics and cheesy lines, but I don't think they really cater to a more mature audience due to their simplicity and lack of originality.The events in the film are equally unimpressive to me because of how recycled everything feels. We've seen too many elements of this story in other superhero movies, and so Blue Beetle's character starts to lose his uniqueness besides the suit (which we learn too little about). It makes me begin to question the point of telling this story.Thankfully, the visual and special effects in this film are one of its positives. The suits and tech on display are deliciously detailed and the fight scenes are choreographed quite well. It makes the action scenes really engaging.Summarily, I think Blue Beetle had the potential to be better. I don't know what the vision for the film was, but what we get is a bit underwhelming.","5/10"

"Blue Beetle","evan_harvey","1 October 2023","Dull, boring and derivative. In short, Blue Beetle sucks. While it's great to have the world's first Hispanic super-hero, it's a shame it has to arrive via this s#!t film.From charmless characters to a convoluted storyline, the whole film just drags.The lead actor - Xolo - is completely uninspiring. Bruna completely lacks a personality. The sister comes across as a complete jerk. The others have the standard Hollywood superhero nothingness, just one dimensional fillers. Presumably they thought that the heavy emphasis on family etc would fill in the gaps, but yeah nah. Didn't at all.The director tries to infuse lots of synth music, but the film never pulls it off right. The plot is both standard and completely sucks. There's nothing new here, folks.Superhero movies saturate the cinemas, and while Marvel has a good run, the DCEU is trying to get started a decade too late. James Gunn might make okay movies, but I doubt he's up to the challenge that rebooting the DCEU will take.Skip it. You won't regret it.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","danmccully","24 December 2023","I'll try not to spoil anything here. I understood that this was going to be Hispanic-centered, which is great. We have quite enough rich white dude heroes, thank you. I found a number of the good-guy characters to be irritating - cutesy but so silly, so irrational, (and so unbelievable?) that I didn't particularly care about them. Believability in a superhero movie? Yes, actually. Believe in the magic or technology, no. But you have to believe that a character could think, choose, and act realistically. This fails that test.Ultimately, this movie is about family and honing a functional team, which is my favorite part. I'll say, though, that Big Hero Six explored this trope much better, with much less cringe. Way, way too much cringe in this movie. Sorry.Meh.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","classicsoncall","26 November 2023","Blue Beetle a DC super-hero - seriously? Unless you're a comic book geek (like I once was), you probably never even heard of the character. Believe it or not, the original Blue Beetle was created in 1939!, appearing in Fox Comics, later owned by Charlton Comics. The character, along with all the other Charlton super-heroes were sold to DC in 1983. Which doesn't clarify much if you're not into that whole scene.So, it's not surprising that this flick is already streaming on MAX, just a short time after its theatrical release a little over three months ago (as I write this). I don't know if that's a record or not, but it does say something about the quality of the picture. Quite honestly, this can be a fun film for young teens, sort of a Spider-Man knockoff if you consider the number of 'legs' the character has when it transforms into the Blue Beetle. It's got that kid from 'Cobra Kai', Xolo Maridue√±a as the title character, so this could be a nice career bump for the young man with his talent and good looks. He's backed up by an almost entirely Hispanic cast, with an unrecognizable George Lopez portraying Jaime Reyes's (Maridue√±a) Uncle Rudy supplying the story's humorous moments. Adriana Barraza is a trip in the role of Jaime's Nana, though I did have to groan when she took up with that monstrous machine gun going up against the army of baddies.Although the post-credits scene suggests a sequel, I can't see filmmakers delving any further into the DC Comics B list of super-heroes, when even ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods"" and ""The Flash"" failed to set the box office on fire. Films like this one test even my patience in trying to be a super-hero movie completist, a sentiment that extends to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as DC.","1/10"

Heck, the mystery of Jenny's dad, who was never shown on screen, was more enticing than the premise of the whole movie.Dude, your boss at a weapon's tech company gave you an important box when the company was entering lockdown, told you explicitly not to open it, not to touch it. You opened it, understood that it was indeed something important despite the box's unassuming appearance, and went ahead to play around with it anyway. What the heck?And so much for insisting ""no killing"" in the first half of the movie, which led to the protagonist annoyingly becoming a punch bag who won't even defend himself. The movie ended with a massacre of the ""bad guys"" while his family was visibly enjoying themselves while doing do.

"Blue Beetle","Anurag-Shetty","20 August 2023","Blue Beetle tells the story of Jaime Reyes(Xolo Mariduena). An extraterrestrial scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, giving him superpowers that alters his life forever. Jaime becomes the superhero, known as Blue Beetle.Blue Beetle is a mind-blowing film. Director Angel Manuel Soto has given us a superhero movie that shines the spotlight on the titular character's family, while also giving us unlimited humor & heart. The action set pieces are phenomenal. The visual effects are perfect. The background score by Bobby Krlic is electrifying & unique, compared to the usual superhero movie background music. The performances are the standout of the film. Xolo Mariduena knocks it out of the park, as Jaime Reyes. Mariduena gives us another spectacular performance after his starring role in fan-favorite, Cobra Kai(2018-). Bruna Marquezine is outstanding as Jenny Kord. Becky G is effective as the voice of Khaji-Da. Susan Sarandon is fantastic as Victoria Kord. Belissa Escobedo is amazing as Milagro Reyes. George Lopez is hysterical as Rudy Reyes. Raoul Max Trujillo is awesome as Carapax. Damian Alcazar, Adriana Barraza & Elpidia Carrillo are excellent as Alberto Reyes, Nana Reyes & Rocio Reyes, respectively. Harvey Guillen is brilliant as Dr. Sanchez. Blue Beetle is a must watch (preferably in IMAX), for Blue Beetle & Xolo Mariduena fans. I'm so glad that James Gunn has decided to include Jaime, in his new DC Universe. Can't wait for future team-ups & sequels!","8/10"
"Blue Beetle","jmstettner-83145","18 September 2023","Very few, except for older diehard Super Hero comics fans actually know who Blue Beetle is. He is not ""the melding of Ironman and Ant Man"" nor is he a smart mouth Gen Z. Blue Bettle is Ted Cord, an industrialist along the lines of Bruce Wayne, more than Tony Stark. He predates DC and was bought by DC from. Charlton Comics. Anyone who goes back to read the originals or his 1980s participation in Justice League will recognize the Watchmen character Owl who was based on Blue Beetle.Sadly, the trend in comics today is to present flawed people with powers rather than Heroes a reader can aspire to. This trend is given a nitro-burst in Hollywood where many supers are actually criminals such as Deadpool, Venom, Black Adam, Joker, Ant Man. It is part of the culture that wants to redefine (read obliterate) the notion of Hero under the guise of ""humanizing"" the character. To paraphrase The Incredibles (a truly underrated story), if no one is special, then everyone is.So it comes as no surprise that this version of Blue Beetle fails, because it offers nothing to lift the spirit of the viewer, nothing they can take with them as they leave the theater. Bruce Wayne comes out of the theater with his parents, having just seen Zorro, only to have them murdered. He idolizes the HERO he saw in Zorro and dedicates his life to fighting crime so no other child has to lose his parents. He is the Dark Knight who does not kill...until the 1980s when. Tim Burton gets his hands on him and devolves the character.You will probably enjoy Blue Beetle as the empty shell, devoid of any human value other than mindless entertainment. Sadly, we could do so much more.","5/10"

The target audience is like boys between 8-11.Characters are boring, the main character/actor has zero charisma. Story is something that a beginner writer writes on an afternoon. Jokes are lame. The armor looks too much like Ironman, and the awkward reactions/interactions were borrowed from Spider-man/Deadpool. Warner management (after many failures) still thinks they can save money on writing the story, because it's super hero era in the cinema, and people automatically likes everything about super heroes.It's truly the time to say goodbye to the DCEU.Let's hope James Gunn and the AI will adapt the characters better, and write enjoyable stories in the next years.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","danchilton-71955","6 November 2023","The original DCEU utters it's last wheeze with Blue Beetle, a film with just about enough character to avoid being the most generic superhero movie of all time. Emphasis on just about.It really should be better than it is since it has plenty of elements that ought to add up to a fun super hero caper. The focus is on a whole family rather than yet another lone outsider, it puts a different culture front and centre and it leans (or at least tries to) into the bright and silly side of the genre. Unfortunately so many parts of the movie feel like they've been given the absolute minimal effort.The story sees Jamie Reyes return to his home city after graduating law school to find out his family are facing eviction. He takes a job with his sister at the mansion of an industrial CEO and promptly gets them both fired but ends up in possession of ""The Scarab"", an alien super weapon that is basically a sentient Iron Man suit. Naturally the evil corporation the suit was liberated from want it back and conflict ensues.Pretty much every part of the plot is as by the numbers as you can imagine. Evil corporation treading all over the little guy? Check. Said corporation's villainous goal is create an army of super soldiers? Check. Bad guy that's a colour swapped version of the main character? Check. Day saved by the power of family/friendship? Check. Its all here and not delivered with anywhere near enough finesse to excuse the cookie cutter nature of proceedings. The same ""it'll do"" approach is applied to dialogue and even the special effects, with jokes that pretty much never land and wildly inconsistent CGI.The acting ranges from not bad to, well, bad. At one end of the scale is Xolo Mariduena who despite having crumbs to work with in terms of character development manages to inject enough likability into Jamie that you don't want to see him get smeared across the floor, even with the insipid dialogue between him and the B-tech Friday AI that powers the Beetle suit. On the other end of the scale is a career low performance from Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord. I'm not sure if she was asked to chew scenery but decided to try and play it more sinister or was told to be intimidating but decided to camp it up. Either way she falls completely flat somewhere between the two. Maybe she read the final script and simply couldn't be bothered. It's a pity since, with a bit fleshing out, her character could have been interesting given she has every right to feel scorned. As it stands the message from her character arc seems to be patriarchy is...good?The only thing saving Blue Beetle from the absolute dregs of the genre is the Reyes family. None of them are particularly complex but they are all enjoyable and give off a genuine sense of family togetherness that adds some heart to proceedings. They mostly all get a moment to shine but you feel the best version of this film would have found a way to put them more front and centre. There is one joke/twist involving the grandmother that just doesn't work at all. I can imagine the film makers pictured the audience rolling in the aisles but staring in bemusement is the more likely outcome.It really feels like Blue Beetle needed taking back to drawing board and rebuilt one more time but the studio just wanted to toss it out there so they could get on with starting their whole universe afresh.4 successful revolutions started by geriatric matriarchs out of 10.","5/10"

"Blue Beetle","movieman6-413-929510","19 August 2023","Blue Beetle is a superhero action movie from Angel Manuel Soto, director of Twelve and La granja.Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridue√±a) returns home to his family, but learns that a lot has changed during his college years at home and his family has deteriorated financially. To help his family, he looks for a job, which he tries to find at the wealthy company Kord Industries. Here he comes into contact with Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), who asks him to help her smuggle something out of the company.What Jaime smuggles out turns out to be an alien scarab, which Jaime chooses as a symbiotic host. This is how Jaime turns into the Blue Beetle. Now he must fight Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the boss of Ford Industries, who wanted to use the scarab for her own purpose. To counter the scarab, they try to threaten Jaime and his family, so Jaime as Blue Beetle now has to try to protect his family.This movie was first going to be released on the HBO Max streaming service, but they later decided to release the movie in cinemas anyway. It was also unclear whether this film still belongs to the old DC Extended Universe film series, or at least as the start of the new DC Universe film series, this film series would start. James Gunn, the new CEO of the DC film series, was also growing past this himself at first, but eventually decided that the film would meet as the first film of his new DC film series, because he still wanted to use the character of Blue Beetle at the front of this film series. Despite meeting then anyway for this new movie series, the movie remains much of a standalone with no real further references to other DC movies to come in the future. James Gunn can still remember that.Despite the uncertainty of which film series the film belongs to, the film itself remains a standard, standard superhero film, which does not bring much uniqueness. The movie is good about a Latino superhero, who carries this culture with him. This is something unique for a superhero movie.Furthermore, the film seems to copy more superhero moments from other superhero films. For connoisseurs of this kind of film, the film can come across as a bit unoriginal and it remains on a predictable side without creating real tension.The visual effects are also on the mediocre side with more of the quality you expect to see on a streaming service, which was also the idea for this film. For example, some of the effects appear less spread out.Xolo Maridue√±a tries to be the main character for as many days as possible, but this is sometimes made difficult for him by the standard quality of the film. Still, just as if he meets the early seasons of the TV series Cobra Kai, he knows how to portray a character that you as a viewer care about. Just like with Cobra Kai when the focus shifts to several different characters, he falls more into the background. Together with the castles, which his other relatives play, they still come across as a family with a Latino culture. Sometimes they just often try to do unnecessary things, while this is not always necessary. The villains in the film also come across as a bit standard as clich√© villains from a superhero movie, who have no real good reasons for their evil plans.","3/10"

"Blue Beetle","kmkevinn-64733","21 August 2023","As blandly competent, cliched, and underwhelming as superhero films are becoming, Blue Beetle squanders an opportunity to do something truly new and revolutionary in favour of pulling remainders out of the recycling bin. While this latest DC offering does have some strong elements going for it, most of them revolving around the story's prominent Mexican-American representation, there's nothing inventive, new, or creative to be found within the actual story or it's mechanics. Blue Beetle is a boilerplate film welded together out of useable spare parts lifted from more successful and entertaining superhero films. Instead of redefining a genre and imbuing it with new life via a vibrant cultural backbone, Blue Beetle only further enhances the feelings of growing superhero fatigue. Let's start with the handful of things that work well in Blue Beetle, beginning and almost ending with the rich family dynamic that gives the film all of it's heart.The ""best"" moments in Blue Beetle come whenever the film simply lets the family members be themselves, the worst part that the drama does not exists, there was tons of Espa√±ol musics. It does not larger cogs in a big budget, effects laden machine. This film is as generic as they come, we have seen it all before and done a lot better. The script could have easily been created by A. I. that watched a thousand hours of superhero films! Every detail of the adventure and backstory in Blue Beetle has been cobbled together from spare parts left over from Man of Steel, The Flash, every Batman film, every Spider-Man film (someone might as well just say ""with great power comes great responsibility"" here and just make it more obvious), Iron Man, Shazam, and Ant-Man.Blue Beetle is frustrating and forgettable because the potential for something better is evident, but it settles for the path most travelled instead. In my honest opinion, I don't think this film stands a chance at the box office, it reeks of writing by committee and corporate meddling. Blue Beetle isn't one of the worst films of the year, but it's absolutely one of the most disappointingly average ones.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","divinalondon","6 October 2023","The individual responsible for churning out this abomination should seriously contemplate a career change, one that involves absolutely no association with the film industry whatsoever. Let's delve into this cinematic catastrophe, shall we? Brace yourself for a litany of lamentation as I dissect every wretched aspect of this atrocity.First and foremost, the plot is an exercise in abject mediocrity. It's as if the screenwriter took a nap halfway through and decided to just roll with the most insipid and uninspired narrative elements possible. The result? A plot so devoid of creativity that even the most dedicated fans of mind-numbing tedium would struggle to find any redeeming qualities.Now, let's talk about the characters - or should I say, the vapid caricatures that grace the screen. These characters are not just your run-of-the-mill dull; they are remarkably, unbelievably, and profoundly stupid. Their actions and decisions defy logic and common sense to such an extent that you'll find yourself questioning the very fabric of reality.The dialogues, if you can even call them that, are about as generic as a cardboard box. It's as if the scriptwriters employed a random word generator to craft the lines, resulting in exchanges so devoid of wit, depth, or originality that you'll be pining for the days of Shakespearean prose.And then we arrive at the acting. Oh, the acting. If you could even call it that. The performances in this travesty of cinema are so wretchedly poor that you'd be forgiven for thinking you stumbled upon a community theater production gone horribly wrong. It's as if the cast was instructed to channel their inner wooden planks, with every emotion delivered in a painfully forced and unconvincing manner.The only semblance of redemption in this cinematic abyss lies in the special effects. I suppose if you're the type of viewer who derives satisfaction from pretty lights and flashy explosions, then congratulations, you've found your silver lining. But even the special effects can't salvage this sinking ship; they merely serve as a shiny distraction from the underlying ineptitude.To liken the acting in this film to that of a ""cheap TV series"" would be an insult to the multitude of talented actors who grace the small screen. No, this is a level of performance that can only be equated to the most bottom-tier, bargain-bin productions, where thespian skills seem to be optional.The entire film feels like a mind-numbing descent into the depths of idiocy. It's as if the creators took inspiration from the lowest quality, brainless cartoons and decided to replicate that asinine formula on the big screen. As the film trudges on, it only becomes increasingly moronic, pushing the boundaries of absurdity and leaving the audience in a state of bewilderment.At some point during this cinematic train wreck, I found myself teetering on the precipice of anger. Yes, anger. Anger at the audacity of subjecting viewers to this festival of imbecility. It's a genuine affront to the intelligence of anyone unfortunate enough to have wasted precious minutes of their life on this abomination.I had such high hopes for ""Blue Beetle,"" but what a colossal letdown it turned out to be. In comparison to this travesty, even the most maligned entries in the DC film universe shine like beacons of cinematic excellence. This film isn't just bad; it's a new benchmark for cinematic incompetence, a testament to the depths to which a movie can sink in its quest to be utterly dreadful.","3/10"

Boy oh boy, was I wrong, I seriously hope going forward that this is not the new baseline going forward. Blue Beetle felt possibly the closest thing I have seen to a slightly higher budget CW show but instead of evenly spreading its budget to everything equally they just spent most of it on the suit. I would easily rate this movie a star but the two extras are for the suit and Xolo, whom with a better script would definitely have been better. The jokes do not land whatsoever, in fact I swear I heard some of them done in other movies before, to call the story basic is too kind - it is literally the same story audiences have seen a hundred times, within the first 15 minutes you can practically predict where the entire plot is going to end up and somehow this movie makes it feel even more cheap. Not a great start to all of this, hope they keep the actor but do something completely different going forward.","3/10"
"Blue Beetle","catalyst11225","20 November 2023","I still had high hopes when people were complaining and screaming to put an end to superhero movies a couple of years ago. This genre seems to be the new trend just like zombie movies about a decade ago. Now, after so many disappointments, I believe this is it for me.. Blue bettle is all of the following: weak plot, boring, predictable, horrible acting, crappy writing, and much more... Another thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant screaming and chaos that is supposed to be representative of a Latino family perhaps? To me it was just a way to mask the lack of solid acting and a solid plot. I'll never understand when writers, directors don't even attempt to convince us to believe in what we're watching.. The movie isn't a comedy, at least not to me so grandmas kicking special military units ' butts isn't going to fly with me. I thought Black Adam was mediocre, this is just plain bad. Last point.. I don't understand why it's even pg13? Just because they felt the need to throw a few curse words around? Urgh..","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","williamlcant","26 December 2023","Not sure who approves these projects, but it feels like this movie was completely assembled 10-15 years ago and just released today. The script and animations are as bad as any of the CW shows, so it just feels like you're watching a 2hour episode of the Flash. The character development for the hero and antagonist are incredibly predictable - the family is going to lose the house, rich girl falls for witty street boy who just needs a chance, nothings more important than family, the list goes on and on. As someone who enjoys the character and original story, I appreciate the effort - but I'd love to see DC stop saturating their output of TV and films to focus on quality production.","3/10"
"Blue Beetle","sathervbc","29 September 2023","This movie was an absolute disappointing pile of crap. Hollyweird at its finest shoving PC garbage down our throats. The plot is so simular to all other super hero films. It drags allt, the comedy is just plain and simple BLAH. George Lopez is just not funny. If this is part of Gunn's new DC reboot, then his other reboots will probably fail. The worst start to a reboot group of films. My wife, who is a native Spanish speaker thought this film was really really bad. I hope to hell there isn't a sequel. I don't have a problem with the actor choices, but even the dialog and acting was really bad.","1/10"

Lack of flashbacks: 7This movie is a giant mess and doesn't understand what it is trying to be or tell.The hero has a sister who constantly whines about how South American people have in hard in this city and how other people, likely White rich people, have it all and take it all no matter how hard these Mexican immigrants work so she doesn't even want to get an education or a proper job as it won't matter in her eyes. Yet the movie shows exactly why she is working low-paid jobs with no job prospects and her brother is working his way up. She uses a private bathroom then instead of trying to sneak herself out brags about her business while strolling out the stall catching the house owner, the evil lady, staring at her and firing her on the spot for being this dull headed. Anyone would have fired her here. She clearly shows she can't even follow basic rules or act civilized. And this type of behavior is constant from her so this one event just illustrated how she acts regularly. She's a racist hateful and extremely lazy uneducated worker. Her brother meanwhile just got this low-skill job and basically in what seems to be their first day gets a giant opportunity for getting a much better job in the company after being fired because of his sister. So a lead character got to explain her worldview with no one budding in and yet if you look at what is actually on screen it's the complete opposite. Yet there is never anyone to dispute any of the claims because the only White person here is the evil lady. They could have made this into some thematic debate yet she is just pure evil with no depth whatsoever.There is also a plot about how the giant tech company didn't make the evil lady CEO and instead made her brother CEO even though she ran it. The movie calls it out as sexist and tells this small story several times over. Yet from the very first scene she is made out to be an evil maniac who doesn't mind killing innocent people to get her way. She's nasty and evil to the bone and extremely open about this threatening people to their face just for fun. Apparently she turned evil after her brother got her job and then took over the job later on. But this is a hard sell. She was a great CEO then by not getting to keep her job turned into an extremely coldhearted murderer? This is an experience millions of people have in real life where they don't get their fair share. You get turned down or lose your job for unfair reasons all the time. Maybe even once every 5 years if you work in a competitive industry. If all those people turned into psychopaths we would have a huge problem. A more logical explanation would be that she was always pure evil and just hid this as she was gifted power from a young age because of nepotism and didn't need to step on toes. People saw this and replaced her and she clawed her way back. Actually, this would be a BETTER story. Instead everything is sexist or racist here. She experienced sexism and she is apparently racist. There is nothing deeper here.We also have the love interest literally cause a main death. An act that would make her hated forever in any real setting. Yet here they don't even mention it. Because obviously she's part of the good guys so her actions are therefore positive like in all other superhero movies. The movie doesn't care about what actually happens. It just forces a storyline into events that don't support this storyline whatsoever. It's like the writers didn't understand their own story which seems extremely common in modern movies that are largely produced. This trope scene is here, that trope scene is here. Step by step. Except they don't really create a storyline combined. Producers just selected them ahead of making the movie and forced a progressive immigrant theme onto everything and the writers just had to follow suit. Yet the themes are utter nonsense just forced into the movie via dialogue. It removes all depth and clearly this is why all actors phones it in.Everything here is extreme cringe. The acting is horrible and all dialogue is extremely on the nose in a way where even kids would notice this. Which is extra offensive as this is made for Latin Americans and other DC movies weren't this childish and silly. So they investigated the main market for this movie and figured out they had to make all characters constantly say what they were doing as they figured viewers wouldn't get it otherwise. Superhero movie viewers are not the smartest group of people overall, but this is made for people who don't even understand basic movie stories and have never seen a superhero movie before. So are Latin Americans in USA this clueless about basic superhero stuff? They have never seen a single superhero movie before?It's also extremely irritating how the lead does nothing. Everyone just pushes him around, but he's not even kind or smart. He's not even a clear weakling trying to stay safe. He's just nothing. He doesn't make any decisions and doesn't react or change things. His sister is bullying him because she's hateful and bigoted yet while they share parents he's completely different. They could at least have made him try to hide or avoid danger or responsibility like with Spiderman. Or made him into a regular guy trying to keep his life normal like with Clark Kent. Just some motivation in some direction even if it's something negative.The story overall is also nonsense even if we ignore the extremely cringe moral stuff. In one scene they need to break into a building and randomly we learn that a family member has made an extremely advanced system to shut down any security system anywhere even though this is an extremely advanced building with a room full of security guards controlling the IT security. We never learn why he knew all this extremely advanced IT stuff as an old guy or why he acts like a poor clown living with his brother when he is actually a genius. In another scene regular characters pick up weapons and become superheroes right away. Zero training. This is what modern movies do wrong. They always want to have some young girl also be a superhero and then create superheroes out of whole families. Which could work in some cases if they received training first and could die. If they are just like the main character superhero then obviously it means nothing. In another scene the main character has something extremely wrong with his body and needs to seek help right away. Yet his family is afraid of cops as they are illegal aliens. So they forbid him to seek help and freak out when he does. Again, this makes zero sense. He's 22. Why would they let him suffer and potentially die just to remain hidden? Are they psychopaths? He's an American citizen who just got his diploma yet suddenly he's not allowed to talk to doctors or people who may help? What?The movie looks and feels like a long episode of a dirt cheap TV show. But unfortunately TV shows have way better writing today. So besides the CGI being cheap and acting clearly all one-takes with no depth it doesn't even live up to a B tier TV show. Though I must admit some of the superhero TV shows are quite terrible. This is not just bad, this is unwatchable. And I am truly shocked that reviewers didn't notice the horrible acting and pathetic writing. Just watch the first 5 minutes. It's extremely clear this is not a good movie so how did people miss this?","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","josjwj","26 November 2023","As stated above this exact film would have been completely passable if still flawed if it had been released between 2001 & 2009. Now it's just a tedious. First I'll discuss the film's virtues and flaws regardless of its era and the elaborate on how it's era culminates to make it a chore to sit through.This film is led by Jaime Reyes played by Xolo Mariduea who us Cobra Kai fans know as Miguel Diaz the star eagle fang student. Solo's performance is perfectly acceptable for what the movie requires of him. Jaime is a fresh college graduate with a seemingly unplayable amount of student loan debt a super relatable problem and with the exception of Peter Parker(kinda) a problem never explored in a superhero film. If the film had focused on Jaimie's struggles with his debt a more interesting superhero film could have been made, but it doesn't because after this is revealed we meet his parents who are...Jaimie's parents and that's it, his sister who's an exposition machine and the worst of them all uncle Rudy played by George Lopez, uncle Rudy is the most obnoxiously cliche comic relief character I've seen in a long time, and like all the others cliche unfunny comic relief characters he doesn't go anywhere he's with us for the rest of the runtime. Even if this film had come out in an era where we were not yet fatigued by the ""superhero hero"" formula I'd still hate uncle Rudy!There's also a love interest and and an Obadiah Stane esc Villian played by Susan Sarandon. Susan Sarandon feels like she doesn't know why she is playing this character and puts in effort accordingly. The love interest is pretty much in the same boat as Xolo: perfectly acceptable for what little she has to work with.I'll check spoilers just in case but you can't spoil this movie it's a superhero origin film if you've seen any superhero origin story you've seen this movie. If you expect surprises you will be disappointed.Like I said in the first paragraph if this film had been released the period between 2001-2009: yeah I'd hate uncle Rudy and the villain seems uninteresting but that would be a decent 2 hour sit. Now when superhero films almost feel like they're coming off an assembly line it's almost infuriating to sit through. I'm a comic book film fan and I don't want them to fail and disappear I just want them made with passion. I'd rather have fewer that are made with heart than many that are interchangeable.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","rodneydalecombs","19 December 2023","I got through the movie. However, most definitely the most boring, predictable, and least exciting DCEU movie out there. It had soooo much potential with the cast, visual effects, and great original story/background to use for Blue Beetle. However, it was a chore to keep my attention for more than 15-20 minutes at a time. The story is terrible. Action is far too limited. It's like a really bad, artificial vanilla taste after you take this movie in. I really tried to enjoy it but at the end just very unsatisfied and disappointed. Very huge miss with this one. Actors and visuals prevent an even lower score for me.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","a_sad_cow","18 October 2023","We've already had a fantastic Blue Beetle in the Young Justice series with so much character development and world development, neither of which were present in this film. What we did get as a lot of fancy CGI, lazy writing, and what should be an offensive quantity of stereotypes.One of the things that made Blue Beetle so interesting in Young Justice was both how overpowered/lethal the scarab was, and how fundamentally peaceful Jaime was. It's a fine line that this film thoroughly muddled at every opportunity. Cutting a bus in half that just so happens to result in no casualties before this dynamic is even set up? A ""systems check"" that needlessly endangers the host, just because it's fun to film? Magically rubber weapon to knock down soldiers at rocket speed? Mass effect weapons that happen to be completely non-lethal? A scarab that internalizes the importance of non-lethality just in time to stop Jaime from making a good kill?While there's nothing wrong with including cultural elements, it was blatantly obvious they were not only jam packing as many tropes as they could, but forcing them where they don't fit. For instance, it's perfectly reasonable to accidentally mispronounce ""Jaime"" when it's written, but does anyone ever repeat back ""Jamie"" when they're hearing the name for the first time? Does anyone in a suit ever get dismissed as a delivery driver for the color of their skin?How was Jaime becoming Blue Beetle something so crazy and foreign in one scene, and then cut to the lore of the previous Blue Beetle? Might we have introduced this backstory some other way than lazy dialogue walking through a room of old props?This movie is a complete waste of time and should not be watched by anyone for any reason. Feel free to reboot Blue Beetle immediately.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","rdamian1963","17 November 2023","Yawn. Is it over yet? This yet another of Warner Brothers DC Universe movies that just keeps dragging on and on. The movie is an origin movie that isn't quite an origin story. It tries to be overly fun. At times it works. Other times it just falls flat. The acting is reason le but the script is lacking. Action sequences range from decent to subpar. It has become the standard for both DCU and MCU movies to achieve at best mediocrity in recent years. As with other movies this brings nothing new to the table. It relies on its special effects rather than a great storyline and script. Unfortunately for DC you just keep missing the mark.","3/10"

"Blue Beetle","lordanidem","23 November 2023","This is a new low for the genre. This movie has zero original thought and they try to hide it in a near offensive level of Hispanic stereotypes.Not all Hispanics are poor, nor do we somehow resent white people if we are. I don't constantly sing and dancin. I don't have a crazy uncle with a truck named ""Taco"".Get it!!! Taco Truck!!! That hysterical, said nobody...Seriously the only stereotype missing is the 4ft crucifix on the wall. A joke perfectly pulled off by the late Matthey Perry in the movie Fool's Rush In.And unfortunately there is Race Baiting. Intentionally mispronouncing of Jamie's name. A baddie (Susan Sarandon) who intentionally calls her Hispanic worker by the wrong names. A reference to a grandmother being a guerilla rebel fighting white imperialists for no reason except to explain her being able to use a belt fed cannon like Jesse Ventura in Predator...Nothing but pieced together but of other superhero movies. Leaning heavily on Iron Man and Spiderman.I almost want to cheer the inclusion of O. M. A. C., an obscure comic that I used to read. Untill I saw that what was a living breathing character wast turned into yet another cybernetic soilder suit.Iron Man 3 anyone???Then the made the OMAC suit a inexcusable copy of Maximilian from The Black Hole.

"Blue Beetle","MrDHWong","14 September 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is a superhero film serving as the 14th installment in the DC Extended Universe. Starring Xolo Maridue√±a in the title role, it functions as a cookie-cutter superhero origin story that leaves little else to the imagination.After recently graduating from university, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridue√±a) returns to his hometown in Palmera City. While awaiting a job opportunity at Kord Tower, Jaime is handed a small box by Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), the niece of the company CEO Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). Jenny tells Jaime to guard the box with his life and ensure its contents don't fall into the wrong hands. Upon arriving back home, Jaime's family convince him to open the box where they soon discover it contains a mysterious alien Scarab. When Jaime touches the Scarab, it fuses with his body, giving him a durable exoskeleton and super powers that allow him to become the hero known as the ""Blue Beetle"".Ever since the character's first appearance in 1939, the superhero Blue Beetle has undergone not one but three different canon iterations. The most recent of which is Jaime Reyes, whom upon debuting in 2006, has gone on to become arguably the most recognisable version of the character. From appearing on the TV series ""Smallville"" to being playable in various DC video games, it seems that the Reyes incarnation of Blue Beetle is the one that resonates most prominently with both modern comic book fans and novices alike. In 2023, the character made his live action film debut in the DC Extended Universe's ""Blue Beetle"", a cut-and-paste origin story adventure that feels all too familiar.There's hardly anything this film does that hasn't already been done in almost every superhero movie before it. From the very beginning, it's hard not to have a feeling of deja vu when the set up is first introduced to us. We watch as a team of explorers uncover an otherworldly artefact in Antarctica, which is then immediately handed over to a big-shot CEO of a major company who plans to use it for sinister purposes. Afterwards, we see the protagonist inadvertently becoming involved with said artefact, and using it to fight back against the villainous CEO before it is too late. Does that sound familiar to anyone? If it does then that's because the superhero genre has reached a point where it is near impossible for an origin story to follow any other set pattern. As a result, the film feels dated right out of the box. There simply isn't much entertainment value to be had other than perhaps through the occasional jokes about the lead character's ethnic origins. Maybe it's just superhero fatigue finally setting in, but I found nothing else worth mentioning about the film's plot.With that in mind, the film at least does a nice enough job at investing the audience in its overarching theme of familial bonding, something which is heavily emphasised in Latin American culture. Though they do feel a bit generic at times, I did like the parts where Jaime fights to protect those he cares about. The best scenes were when Jaime is learning about what powers he has and noticing that his family members support him along the way. It is clear here that the Reyes family have each other's backs no matter what, which is especially evident given how often they are seen placed in the way of danger. Without giving away spoilers, I particularly liked one scene that made great use of the family dynamic when they are required to fight back against a large number of enemies. In most other films, the main character's family members are either relegated to the background or end up used as a cheap plot device to move the story along, but here they are all used quite nicely. Even Jaime's elderly grandmother has a highlight moment.In the lead role, Xolo Maridue√±a was the perfect choice to play the eponymous character, not merely due to his Latin heritage but also because of the physicality involved. Anybody who watched Maridue√±a on ""Cobra Kai"" will likely remember his ability to handle himself in combat, dishing out blow after blow against his adversaries. It's just a shame that Jaime Reyes is so generically written in this movie, like somebody took Peter Parker/Spider-Man and gave him a Latin American paint job. That's not to say I disliked him as a whole, the problem is that I couldn't see anything in him that hasn't been done before in every other young, inexperienced, down-to-earth superhero protagonist since the genre first began. Still, there's room for growth should the character ever appear in a future DC film project.As previously mentioned, the Reyes family are what I would consider to be the emotional backbone for this film. Jaime's grandmother, known simply as ""Nana"", certainly knew how to hold her own whenever things got tough and Adriana Barraza's performance helped make her seem like she could definitely manage it. Nana was my favourite of Jaime's relatives because she seemed like someone with not only the necessary life experience but also the toughness to go along with it. Coming a close second would be Jaime's sister Milagro, played by Belissa Escobedo. Milagro is the type of younger sibling most of us would dream of having, always there to back you up in a pinch and never giving up on you when things turn ugly. In spite of the rest of the film's issues, It's comforting to see a superhero film that places such a strong significance on family values.However, I think Susan Sarandon was wasted as the film's main antagonist Victoria Kord. Her character is so one-dimensional and uninteresting that virtually any other actor/actress could have played the role. Kord is nothing more than your run-of-the-mill greedy CEO villain - she's rich, she's powerful, and she wants to destroy the hero at all costs. That's about it. Though they do attempt to give her some sympathetic backstory, it is never properly expanded upon beyond the fact that her family life is the polar opposite to Jaime's. This could have been a great opportunity to have made her a more layered character but instead the filmmakers played it too safe and her end fate is about as predictable as they come.When taking into consideration the varied quality of the DC Extended Universe, I suppose you could do a whole lot worse than ""Blue Beetle"". It serves its purpose as an obligatory introduction to the character for the uninitiated and sets the stage for his potential return should the studio executives see fit. The film's saving grace is its wholesome view on the necessity of having a loving family, which itself is hardly an original concept (the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies have been doing this for years). With all that said, I can only really recommend this film to hardcore fans of DC, because there are so many other better movies out there that are a more valuable use of one's time.I rate it 6/10.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","jenkinscammy","24 November 2023","So much wasted potential in this movie.The first 45 minutes are incredibly slow and filled with disjointed plot/character development. The theme of ""family values"" is crowbarred into nearly every scene, but the script does a poor job connecting the audience to the characters.Susan Sarandon gives a wooden performance as a one-dimensional baddie. George Lopez falls flat as the zany tech-wizard uncle. Xolo Maridue√±a and
Bruna Marquezine are capable actors and fun to watch, but lack chemistry.Even in the thick of the action, pace is erratic. Bad Hollywood action cliches abound. Rather than overcome obstacles through strength of character, the good guys seem fated to win as teenage girls are able to fight professional mercenaries as equals.Overall, Blue Beetle comes across as a money grab. It copies elements of family superhero films (e.g., Antman) but fails to capture the heart. It takes itself too seriously at all the wrong times. It's just bad entertainment - I literally could not watch it all in one sitting because it was so painful to sit through.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","JapanMovies","20 September 2023","After watching Blue Beetle for two hours, I couldn't help but laugh at the comedic elements of the movie. Sure, it was based on a comic book series, but the way the story was told made it more of a family comedy than a typical superhero flick.One of the standout characters in the movie was Xolo Mariduena's crazy relative, George Lopez. He brought a hilarious energy to every scene he was in, and his quips and one-liners had me chuckling throughout the entire movie.But at the core of the movie was a message about the importance of family and standing up against evil corporations. The main character, Jaime Reyes (played by Mariduena), was a relatable teenager who stumbled upon an alien artifact that gave him superpowers. But instead of using his newfound abilities for personal gain, he chose to fight against the corrupt corporation that was trying to exploit the artifact for their own gain.Throughout the movie, Jaime's family provided a grounding force for him, reminding him of his roots and what truly mattered in life. It was refreshing to see a superhero movie that prioritized family and relationships over flashy action sequences.All in all, Blue Beetle was a pleasant surprise. It had all the elements of a fun superhero movie, but with a comedic twist and a heartwarming message about the importance of family. I can't wait to see what adventures Jaime and his family will go on in future installments..","2/10"

While DC is going through a thorough restructuring, Blue Beetle suffers from the former ownership which ignored good stories for maximizing revenue.Nonetheless, Xolo Maridue√±a is great as Blue Beetle, and we can't wait for him to show up in future DCU installments.The movie is a forgettable piece of film that will be good for getting a few laughs, and not caring about the story or fights, or stakes.

Nothing new, original or funny in the movie.There are way too many 'cartoon-hero' movies being released today and eventually they begin to repeat storylines and themes, as is the case here.

This film just made me so upset with its sheer incompetence, I felt the need to vent with a review.The writing is egregiously lazy with no care given to character development... why would they need to? Every character is a poorly constructed copy of marginally better written ones from other films, so the writers must have assumed the audience will know them immediately. The whole script is just cobbled together from films of the same genre that had better success. People performing impossible physics, irritating screaming throughout, illogical choices made by characters to shoe-horn in story points and actions, practically plagiarized dialogue, the list of dumb goes on and on. The whole shebang felt like it was written by high school students as homework.The acting can't really be blamed for this absolute failure, though it is rather tepid all round, with Sarandon of all people being the worst. No, the blame is on the director who, without vision, ends up selling out to producers, most of whom are only concerned about the safest way to make a buck.Effects? It's a weird sensation to see so much action and be completely bored by it.DC has had one real franchise success with Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy and the rest are on a sliding scale of mediocrity. The massive budget comic book genre is dead, not unlike the massive budget sword and sandal epics of the 50's and 60's. If we're lucky, as a result of this insultingly lacklustre rubbish, a new New Wave of cinema is just around the corner.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","diversecleaning","18 October 2023","This was quite possibly the worst Superhero movie I have ever seen. It could actually be one of the worst all time movies which I have ever seen, except I have seen Sisu, Black Christmas (2006), Assault on Wall Street, and Chop Shop.The dialogue of Blue Beetle was dreadful... absolutely horrendous.The dialogue in Marvle movies is bad, but they are still leagues better than the dialogue in Blue Beetle.Black Widow was actually hilarious while Blue Beetle was cringe worthy.The storyline was ridiculous and was a knock of of Venom (Carnage) and Antman, but with none of the heart, or comedic punchlines.I hate to say it, but Blue Beetle was a box office flop, partially due to it being a terrible movie and partially owning to the rest of the world having zero interest in an all Hispanic Superhero movie.The movie did not even screen in China, which is the only market which seems to still enjoy these silly superhero movies.Dark Superhero movies play well in the United States, while Fast and the Furious and The Avengers have done well in China (and primarily China)..Why would you make a silly Superhero movie which doesn't play well to the foreign/Chinese box office?These studios really should pay more attention to what does well domestically and or what plays well internationally.The Hispanic box office hasn't even clamored for an all Hispanic led film.I'm sure if Blue Beetle was a better film, it would have done better at the box office domestically and internationally, but it was a terrible film and thus did very poorly financially.It is a shame though because I do like Xolo Maridue√±a, but Blue Beetle might kill any career he may have had.","2/10"

With each passing film, I agree more and more with Martin Scorsece's critique of superhero movies.Sometimes it gets tired and this movie was one of the few that made me sleep a little in the cinema, I'm already tired of projects with the same scripts, by God, THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING NEW!!I simply summarize the film with: decent CGI and Cobra Kai's ""Miguel Diaz"" acts well, as does the beautiful Brazilian girl.Bruna Marquezine? I hope to be a more famous Brazilian name like Wagner Moura in the future....Rotten Tomatoes is completely mad with the reviews for this thing!!!

That was not the case with this. Most of the acting was over the top and annoying. The comic relief was cause for painful grimacing. I think DC should just stop making movies, because frankly, they suck at it. Only Aquaman & Wonder Woman had any depth and angst and protagonists that made me care. That's the crux of it all isn't it? Investing and caring about the characters. If you can't pull that off then why bother making the movies because they will just be hollow.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","chenp-54708","19 August 2023","It was okay.It's the typical superhero movie with some fun action moments and solid performances from the cast members. DC Comics has made some pretty good superhero movies in the past but also some pretty bad ones too. Blue Beetle was mainly okay. Throughout, there were some pretty good productions and the superhero/action moments were solid with some fun fight sequences and colorful effects. The direction was alright but there were a few moments that felt a little sloppy. The performances from the cast members were mostly good as Xolo Maridue√±a does a pretty good job performing his role as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle alongside Susan Sarandon, Adriana Barraza and George Lopez as well.For the story, it was fine. It didn't feel too special or as interesting as some of the other superhero stories. Throughout, the camerawork has some solid shot moments and while the humor was mostly meh, there were a few good humor moments. The characters were okay but they weren't fully investing to connect with. There are some dialogue moments that could improve and the uses of special effects and CGI were good. However, there are some not so great CGI aspects but it is definitely better than The Flash.If this movie had came out in the 1990s, I feel like it would have been an smashing hit. Overall, it's not the best DC Comics movie but it does have some good entertaining moments and it's an okay pop-corn piece of entertainment.","3/10"

(Sorry AQUAMAN,) It's not even on the same universe.Don't get me wrong the acting is good, but when George Lopez goes from ""Not knowing anything""
to ""All of a sudden he knows almost everything."" And the plot makes my head hurt. Seriously, I got headache from watching this.DC was making a universe of NEW superheroes and it was shaping up slowly. ""Black Adam"" was really interesting, watching the origin of an ""anti-hero"". The 2nd storyline in the DCU was with the long awaited ""Flash"" which had cameos by Henry Cavill & Gal Godot. Blue Beetle has to have his whole family to fly the Bug-mobile. I remember in the DC comic, it only needed only 1. They must have paid Susan Sarandon a lot for her role as the Ultra Villain. I even thought she was going to say: ""Blue Beetle, I've got you now..hee-hee-hee!I lost count how many times the Villains have shot Blue Beetle & watch it bounce off him, they shoot him anyway.Stupidest thing is all end of the movie even grandma is firing a super gun!

I don't they Mexican people could feel ""represented"" in here, unless they enjoy watching themselves the same way Hollyweird have always portrait them.The plot is as basic as it gets, acting is mediocre, FX boring and cheap.DC have literally no indentity whatsoever, throwing random flicks here and there, one worse the the previous one.Also, why Mexican's have to be Illegal Immigrants?Why ""Grandma"" has to be a ""revolutionary""?Why throw shade at Batman?Why do I have to root for this characters?Why are you trying so hard to kill the superhero genre with garbage like this?Do you enjoy losing money?","4/10"

The characters are very naive and boring and no character growth among any characters and worst of all, the ending was very predictable and idealist. The main character seems to be too gentle and didn't want to hurt anyone to a degree that it was upsetting for me to watch. The romance between 2 characters are also very forced. Blue beetle seem to have a lot of humour in the beginning that i initially enjoy but the movie itself rendered all efforts for comedy essentially useless.

"Blue Beetle","ppineault","18 November 2023","What a terrible film. I think it's a bit of a slap in the face that this film received a 6.1 rating. A weak plot, incredibly mundane script and George Lopez's role was an eye roller. (part of the reason I wanted to see the film is because his name was on the marquee; what a disappointment) and I'm not sure I will ever look at Susan Sarandon with the same regard ever again. (she must've been really hard up for a paycheque or something) I also gathered that it was meant to be 'Latino positive'; in my view, the insultingly bad writing made for the opposite result. The special effects are pretty good but that is the only redeeming quality about this movie.","8/10"

The star is a handsome young man, and he and the rest of the cast suit their roles well. Susan Sarandon makes a dandy villain. Go see it! What a fun night!

"Blue Beetle","ernestobladins","19 August 2023","I didn't have much expectations from this movie, with DC the bar is so low for me lately. The movie follows the standard origin story that we have seen so mantener times before:A protagonist who is trying to live as best as he can his ordinary and mediocre life, is suddenly in contact with a ""special thing created by evil people"" that accidentally gives him superhero powers that he didn't ask for.He struggles to control those powers, causing him to be in uncomfortable situations that cause him to wanna give up his powers and go back to his ordinary life.But when the evil people begin threatening everyone he loves in order to get the powers he has, he is forced to do everything he can to save them, and make sure that those ""evil people"" never get those powers that could be used to destroy the world.As you can see, this is not exactly what one w wouldn't call original stuff. Can it get more generic than this plot after 15 years of superhero movies?The protagonists in this movie doesn't seem o have any agency or his own, he is pretty much nothing without his suit which does all the cool stuff for him, and also he is nothing without his family who saves him so many times.The antagonists and their motivation is also super generic and so dated at this point:""Oh wow, another movie where the entire world is at stake if the wrong hands get the magical stuff that gave him powers... Man I really wonder if this time the world is going to end"". ""Who knows maybe this time it will"".This is not a movie i would recommend watching in the theatre, simply because it is not really a fresh story. It doesn't really add anything new to the genre.The jokes and humour is something that i felt coming every single time because the set ups for the jokes are so obvious, as we have seen them in countless of other marvel movies before.I don't know man. It's the kind of movie that only a kid who has never seen any superhero movie before might enjoy. If you've only watch two or three superhero movies you might think it's great. But for those who have been watching superhero movies for a while this is just more of the same thing.It's like watching a NSFW video on the internet for the hundred time.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","mason25","29 September 2023","CGI wasn't bad, that's about the only positive for the entire movie.The rest from the casting, to the music, to the plot, to everything else, was disgustingly terrible.Over the top stereotypes for basically every last character. With actors and comedians who had no right being cast in any type of role, looking mainly at George Lopez, he was terrible and not even mildly funny... so it's clear he drew on his massive repertoire of a career as a ""comedian"".The action was pretty ho hum, not a single power of the suit was explained in any way, let alone well.The OMAC suit wasn't a terrible premise, but it was shown terribly, along with fabrication of metal out of nowhere..... have we completely left any semblance of this taking place on an earth like planet???I finished it, but really should have taken the other reviews at face value.Overall this was aimed at folks who enjoyed power rangers or other really campy style shows for children.","6/10"

All the scenes look quite tacky and just overall little effort is put into it. The acting all around is weak and it makes it difficult to connect to the characters.As much as Marvel has struggled since endgame, DC has made some of Marvels recent films like Christopher Nolan pieces.This is one of those movies where you can hardly remember the plot even a couple of days later.James Gunn has a huge project ahead in cleaning up the franchise.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","masonfisk","29 August 2023","The next to last DCEU (the Aquaman release is still to come) release currently in theaters. Following the origins of one Jaime Reyes, Xolo Mariduena, as he returns from Gotham City law school to find his family is happy to see him but their own current financial & spiritual straits are up in the air as his dad, Damian Alcazar, is recovering from a heart attack & the family manse is about to be sold from out from under them by the prevalent evil mega-corporation Kord Industries in Palmera City but meeting nice w/the niece, Bruna Marquezine, of its owner, Oscar winner Susan Sarandon, promises Mariduena a job after he came to her defense at their home (he & his sister, Belissa Escobedo, were working as part of the cleaning staff got canned) but when he shows up at Kord HQ he instead gets handed a burger box w/a scarab which he takes home. Showing it off to his family & getting too close to it, causes the object to merge violently into Mariduena's body forming a Guyver like figure which communicates w/him via an internal AI (voiced by singer Becky G) which takes the lead in his use of the suit, since they haven't been fully integrated w/each other. Pissed since she wants to incorporate the tech into battle suits of her own, Sarandon sends out her henchman, Raoul Trujillo (who I remember from Scanners II) to take Mariduena down using any means to his disposal, even going after his family, which results in tragic consequences. Will Mariduena step up & save the day? Fun through & through w/a healthy foothold in the Latin world will make this story, which is very familiar, come alive which unfortunately due to Warner Bros. Ham-fisted handling of their disavowal of the previous DC output continues to paint audiences perceptions if they should venture out to cinemas to watch these things since their emotional investment can be spent elsewhere which is a shame since this film could've done w/Latin fans what Black Panther did for African American ones. Also starring Elpidia Carrillo as Mariduena's mom, Oscar nominee Adriana Barrazza as his grandmom, Harvey Guillen from What We Do in the Shadows as a techie & George Lopez as the crazy uncle of the family who steals every scene he's in.","2/10"

The story has nothing interesting going for it, the cast carried an embarrassing underwhelming performance and the characters were as bland and generic as any family superhero movie you can imagine.

"Blue Beetle","fazetrap-72267","19 August 2023","The movie is a perfect 6/10 star superhero flick. There's nothing new or interesting or anything creative about it. Heard it was originally a Max exclusive. To be honest, wouldn't be surprised if it got dumped there anyway. This is the most Marvel-like DC superhero flick you'll ever see in a while. It doesn't do much new, or even breaks any new ground in the superhero movie genre (not that there's any left to be broken anyway).I did like the family dynamics a little, but if anyone's seen Ms. Marvel of the MCU (that makes like, ten people including me), it will all seem a little too familiar, except this time they are Latino. Some jokes are drawn out a little too much, and just like Marvel, serious moments are diluted with dank jokes that nobody laughs at, except maybe the cast and crew themselves. The villain, was... as expected, forgettable. Makes sense why they didn't feature her prominently in any of the promo or trailers. But hey, when you're making brand-safe superhero movies for kids you gotta draw some lines, I guess.Overall, DC is just a scalding hot mess now, on an uncertain path both creatively and logically. I didn't even try to connect this movie in my head to any of the confusing mess of the DCEU and didn't even bother to use it as a foundation for James Gunn's Universe. If anyone wants, see for what it is and don't take it too seriously. If you don't, fine. The superhero film genre breathed its last on April 26, 2019 anyway.","2/10"

"Blue Beetle","ryanpersaud-59415","24 November 2023","Watching Blue Beetle, I couldn't help but feel that there was absolutely no way this story was going to be continued. Yes, that's because of the impending end of the moribund DCEU, but there's a flash-in-the-pan energy to this movie; the reality is, making a Blue Beetle movie is either an act of supreme confidence (ala Guardians of the Galaxy) or supreme desperation (it's already greenlit, we might as well finish it). I suspect it's the latter.Because Blue Beetle, whilst having some diehard fans, is decidedly D tier in the DC Universe. Personally, I've never really connected with the character, but to be honest, I liked what I saw here. Jaime Reyes (played by Xolo Mariudena) is a likeable, fun protagonist, the sort of old school Spiderman type that DC desperately needs. His family is fun, with George Lopez being the clear highlight, even if the film beats you over the head with the theme of FAMILY more than a Fast & Furious film. It's sweet, but a bit cheesy.The action scenes are surprisingly good (for the most part), with a lot of creative uses of the Blue Beetle's power set. They're easy to comprehend, well choreographed, and you really feel the impact of each hit and punch. Aside from one action scene in particular (outside of Jaime's house), they're well done and memorable.And, I do have to commend the final fight of this film. The film goes in a direction I genuinely didn't expect thematically, and it handles some truly weighty themes. Yes, I know this film is focused on the Mexican-American experience, ""familia,"" and is set in a gorgeous Miami/Los Angeles hybrid (Palmera City is without a doubt the best looking and most memorable city in the DCEU - the Batman's Gotham doesn't count, because that would obviously take the crown).The moment with Raoul Trujillo (he essentially plays the bruiser for Susan Sarandon's um...antagonist, I legitimately forgot her name) basically is revealed to have been a child soldier captured by the U. S. Army and turned into a super soldier is surprisingly powerful. It puts into context what this silly superhero movie is really about: criticizing the long history of U. S. imperialism in Latin America and the exploitative capitalism and white supremacy that entailed. Heavy stuff.However, I'd be lying if I said this film was anything more than a slightly-better-than-expected, yet mostly average superhero romp. The script - outside of some nice moments and funny lines - is pretty awful; it's predictable, basic, and sometimes feels written by an AI. Most of the characters are banal and unmemorable, particularly Jaime's love interest and Susan Sarandon's Victoria Kord. To say Sarandon was definitely miscast in this film would be an understatement. She has no screen presence, feels like she's running through the motions, and is completely forgettable.I also kind of wish the Blue Beetle lore was better explained and that the ""Scarab"" (the device that turns Jaime into the BB) had more of a personality. I think if this film ever got a sequel, they'd focus more on that, but generally...it's a missed opportunity.","3/10"

I actually have no idea - anyway.If you suspend your disbelief and take this with a grain of salt, this can be a lot of fun! There are quite a few super hero tropes and cliches thrown your way. But if you are a cynic, than no superhero movie actually will be able to do the trick for you. Yes beautiful girl, yes pretty boy ... of course they are meant for each other! Every one knows it - except those two. Well for most of the time at least.Also the convenient timing of it all - the villain who seems incapable of ... functioning. But again, all those things - seen before and ""flaws"" that can be detected in every other super hero franchise. Just go with the flow and accept this.

You either find him funny or extremely annoying ... hopefully the former! Otherwise almost the whole movie is ruined. Shame it tanked ... at the box office! Deserved more.","5/10"

This is a terribly cliched backstory that uses pedantic, tired generalizations about Mexican Americans, supposing that NONE can ever escape poverty, no matter how much they study or how hard they work. Beyond that horrendously offensive characterization, we have the tired story of the lovelorn, reluctant hero that is unwittingly overtaken by an alien virus to become the hero. Sounds a lot like Venom...Just not as funny and with much poorer acting. The plot is just bad. Susan Sarandon is only slightly believable as an evil mastermind. Xolo is stretched beyond his apparent acting ability. And George Lopez is just George, but with a horrible goatee. 2/3 of the theater walked out of this tragic excuse for a superhero movie. One can only hope that there is no sequel.","2/10"

And the parts about him constantly fighting it and trying to ""talk it out"" With the bad guy who is beating his face in... like what?They tried to make the movie funny but it didn't come off right. There was too much talking and not enough action. Too many main leads, it had me asking who was the main character again. It seemed everyone got the same amount of screen time. The love story had no chemistry it felt out of place. The movie quickly got boring. The lead character had nothing memorable about him. He just felt like an average guy. A Mary Sue.

The script was horrendous. I hope to never see George Lopez in another movie after this one; I absolutely hated his character. Just terrible. From the super-smart, smart-ass, stupid uncle to the sweet old grandma who led a revolution at the end, and the mother who's only purpose for being in the movie was to support her son for 5 seconds at the very end, everyone sucked. Xolo Mariduena was a good choice for Blue Beetle but he couldn't save this movie from the terrible writing and directing. He was the only actor I didn't loath by the end of the movie.Just awful. The story was incredibly predictable from the first 10 minutes. The directing was terrible. Important or heartfelt scenes fell flat, the jokes never landed, the action was boring. It felt like a knock-off version of Ironman, but not good. I am mad at myself for wasting my time with it.And the worst thing is the studio will try to blame the writers / actors strike for the bad box office. The writers are to blame for the script and story, so they deserve some of the blame. But the movie is going to flop because it is truly terrible.DC has some of the coolest superheroes, but they can't make a movie worth watching. Blue Beetle has so much potential, I wish it had been made by the early marvel studios.","4/10"

The script from start to finishis terrible and tries to imitate other Superhero Movies, The family of the ""Hero"" is stupid, loud and completely irresponsible, And we could already see it in the part where they not only pressed him to openthe box but also played with the alien object and threw it to each other. The worst character in the movie besides Jaime himself, Who only God knows why he was chosen as the host by the Beetle, Is hissister Milagro who has no sense of responsibility, Maturity or logic, And made all the possible mistakes. Not to mention the villain who is one of the worst villains I have ever seen, Although the pacifist""Hero"" who is afraid to hurt the villain, And constantly apologizes like a girl with cuckoos for fighting him, Is no less worse than him. And we haven't even talked about the dialogues and the unfunny jokesthroughout the film, Which I stopped dozens of times due to nervousness about the script .In short, This is a bad movie and a waste of more than two hours of time. Believe me, There are much more interesting and important things you can do with this wasted time instead of watching this badmovie, Which I have no idea how it got such a high rating relative to what it's really worth.","7/10"

There were some fine actors in this film, a few of them had decent performances, but it's like a script was written and entire characters, their sole purpose being comic relief, were written in. Blue Beetle's sister actively took away from the plot with every scene she was in. George ""Batman is a fascist"" (an actual line he said in this movie) Lopez wasn't far off.It's a real shame too.

Mix the butter and sugar together very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Fold in the flour, baking powder, chocolate and ¬º tsp salt as quickly as you can. Don't overwork the dough.2. leave the mixture overnight: either cover the bowl and chill, or roll the mixture into balls and chill.3. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment. Divide the mixture into balls, the craggier the balls, the rougher the cookies will look. If you want to give the dough more texture, tear the balls in half and squidge them lightly back together. Space out evenly on the baking sheets, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading.4. Bake the fresh cookies for 8-10 mins and the chilled ones for 10-12 mins, or until browned and a little crisp at the edges but still very soft in the middle - they will harden a little as they cool. Leave to cool on the tray for a few minutes before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Enjoy, at least cookies are enjoyable, unlike this movie.","3/10"

Susan really is killing it and they should base much more of the movie on her.Javiers (Xolo) family is as I mentioned before just like annoying stereotypical personalities on speed. Outside the family is Bruna (Jenny Kord) so unbelivable in any kind of position in the Kord company. She just does a terrible performance in this role.The bug suit is kind of cool in the beginning but you loose interest in that in like five minutes.

"Blue Beetle","thePopcornExplorer","20 November 2023","I guess my first question in retrospective is why did I even watch this, I promised myself since the Black Adam disaster I wouldn't see any more DC movies and I still saw this one, I guess since I became a huge fan of the Cobra Kai TV show I was curious to see Xolo on a different role but I will stick to my original promise.There's isn't much to add that wasn't already stated on most of the reviews, it's a basic movie, with the same standard formula of super hero film since the late 2000's, cringe, predictable and with poor dialogue, the acting even from big names like Susan Sarandon was vey off putting, for some reason there are a few dark scenes that don't quite match the overall soft and goofy tone of the film which also felt weird and overall it is a bad flick.I guess it was a good era for super hero fans but all evidence point to a decline of the genre, even Marvel has been having a horrible set of movies and TV shows with one or two exceptions, I feel that this won't happen because money always talks louder but I feel we should move on to the next thing, we ran out of new fresh ideas and are stuck with boring, pointless and superficial stories.I guess the only good thing about this film and the reason I am not rating it lower is some cool scenes of fighting with nice VFX and soundtrack and of course the Spanish-American representation, I am all up for popular flicks to have this diversity and I think Hollywood would do everyone more justice if the stories were actually good.","4/10"

As a Latino, it's genuinely heartwarming to see a superhero who shares a part of my cultural background. It's like finally getting an invite to the big league superhero table, and the guacamole is just right!The plot? A whirlwind of corporate espionage, family drama, and a hefty dose of alien tech. Jaime Reyes, fresh from Gotham Law (because where else do you study law in a superhero universe?), finds himself embroiled in a mess involving an ancient alien artifact and Kord Industries. The story has its moments, especially when it taps into the family struggles and the whole eviction subplot - it's like a telenovela with more spandex and less melodramatic gasping.Now, Becky G as the voice of Khaji-Da? Absolute casting gold. She brings a certain flair to the sentient Scarab, balancing between sassy and wise. It's like having a tiny, armored life coach attached to your spine, constantly giving you pep talks and occasionally morphing into a battle suit.But here's the rub - ""Blue Beetle"" flutters between being really engaging and feeling like a checklist of superhero tropes. The whole OMAC angle with Victoria Kord felt like I've seen it before in a dozen other hero flicks. Plus, the final battle? Predictable. I mean, come on, even my abuela guessed the twist with Carapax's tragic backstory. And the whole mid-credits scene with the ""Ted is alive"" spiel? It's like they're not even trying to surprise us anymore.In conclusion, ""Blue Beetle"" is like that new restaurant everyone's been hyping up - it's good, the ambiance is nice, and the guacamole (read: Latino representation) is on point. But at the end of the day, it's not the culinary revelation everyone promised. It's a solid 3.5 stars - a fun ride but not quite the gourmet experience of superhero cinema.

"Blue Beetle","ulbricht1","27 September 2023","The highly anticipated ""Blue Beetle"" arrived in theaters with the hope of revitalizing the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Regrettably, this superhero film fails to live up to expectations, making it difficult to see how it can contribute to the resurgence of DC on the big screen.""Blue Beetle"" introduces us to Jaime Reyes, a young teenager who stumbles upon an alien scarab that grants him incredible powers. While the premise is intriguing, the execution falls flat.The film's primary issue is its lackluster storytelling. The plot feels disjointed, and character development is minimal. As a result, viewers are given little reason to become emotionally invested in Jaime Reyes or his journey as the Blue Beetle. The potential depth and complexity that could have enriched this superhero origin story are disappointingly absent.The action sequences, while occasionally entertaining, are hindered by mediocre CGI and uninspired choreography. Additionally, the absence of memorable villains further diminishes the film's impact, leaving audiences yearning for a more compelling antagonist to challenge our hero.It's disheartening to witness DC struggling to find its place in the superhero film landscape, particularly when compared to the consistent success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ""Blue Beetle"" represented an opportunity to introduce an exciting new character to the DCEU, but it ultimately falls short.While the film is not devoid of merits, such as some decent performances from the cast, it is evident that ""Blue Beetle"" lacks the depth and vision necessary to elevate DC's cinematic universe. In a time when superhero movies continue to dominate the box office, this underwhelming entry does little to advance DC's standing. One can only hope that future DC films will learn from the shortcomings of ""Blue Beetle"" and deliver the compelling storytelling and character development that fans crave.","5/10"

Who knew that super heroes (I use the term very lightly) did a ""Take your family to work day"" tragic in every meaning of the word. Too many histrionics from all concerned, if squealing, screaming and shouting were super powers these guys would be the tops. Not sure who this is aimed at, someone who has never seen a film before maybe, it wouldn't encourage them to watch another.

Basically we have very high expectations and, as it happens, that leads often to disappointment.Imagine, if you will, that you could show this film in 2003 for instance. The outcome would have been very different, it would have been a smash hit, a record breaker, even with the imperfections that are so obvious to us today.Don't get me wrong, this film isn't rubbish... it's just a bit too predictable and the writing is a bit, umm, how do you say that in the USA? Ah yes, ""half-a*sed"".Pity!","4/10"

Cheesy and clearly forced expressions of villainous attempts.Know your audience before you make a movie. It's the parents taking their kids to see superhero movies, not the other way around. Movies are just making random gadgets to sell merchandise for kids.Honestly I could not finish the movie and I wouldn't even force my kids to watch it.

The story is unfortunately one that we have seen milion of times over and over again. Its like we already saw this movie, however, still it flows .However in my opinion it's major flaw is what the studio said is it's major selling point, that is the fact that it's the first major Latino superhero. However the latinos in this movie act as the most stereotypical way, loud , poor, the granny straight out of Coco, the taco eating , the crazy truck etc etc.","1/10"

His over the top Mexican stereotype was annoying every time he was on scene. Now like him as a stand up comedian but in this movie he was horrible. His over the top performance and utter disgusting stereotype was funny for all of 2 seconds before it annoyed the crap out of us.The plot of the movie is your regular superhero vs bad guy story. Rich bad family trying to monopolize an army to gain power. Only to be taken down by some family and a niece with the help of the scare of course. Now I've never heard of the blue beetle before so this world is all new to me, coming from fresh eyes.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","jamesgreenwall","17 December 2023","Blue Beetle, a movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, is a superhero movie staring Xolo Mariduena as Jamie Reyes, the Blue Beetle. The film focuses on Jamie and his life after he gets ""possessed"" by a blue scarab. However this movie has two main flaws that really make it a mid tier movie.The movie overall is honestly not horrible. It is a very middle ground movie, however it falls flat firstly, because it just follows the same plot lines and cliches of other super hero movies. The movie revolves around the theme of family and how it is the true power, and it lasts forever. This is cool and all, however it has just been used so many times. This movies theme feels almost like a copy and paste of Shazam, with just a rewrite.I'm not saying this movie isn't enjoyable though. The cinematography is very enticing. The suits, espically Blue Beetle's is very well done. The fighting scenes and the scenes in general were all around pretty good. It was very enjoyable, however the second flaw of the movie is that the acting is bad from almost the entire cast. The acting really just feels forced and cheesy and it isn't good. It falls flat espically from Mariduena. His character, Jessie is just so basic it hurts. It feels like too much of a classic hero troupe. Innocent, kind, loving, awkward. It's really just so cliche and it doesn't fall together well at all. Making it hard to watch at parts.However in conclusion the movie was entertaining and overall not horrible. Sure not great but it is a fun watch for families, probably with more adult kids, and overall is not a bad super hero movie, just middle ground and cliche.","3/10"

No teenage boy or young adult would say that (Or even people with a job!), that's the part where I knew I'm in for a rough time. Well that, and the part where he bit into the taco and went 'mmmm' without even chewing for flavor.Why was he 'chosen' again? Cause he white-knighted for the girl?A chopper with a weapon is trying to kill/capture your family, beetle boy got a clear shot to incapacitate them all but one look at his father having a heart attack made him stop what he is doing. He didn't think for a second that by stopping the threat targeting EVERYONE might be a better decision than to stop and get emotional and thereby get caught anyway? OMG stop I can't watch anymoreSo a few minutes later he would refuse to kill or at least permanently disable villains who would try and kill his family while at the same time his family members found it easy to step / impale soldiers with a huge bug leg.

"Blue Beetle","ddb614","19 August 2023","Honestly the movie was just meh. It's an ok watch. Not a great start to James Gunns universe. The script was not good and it felt like it wasn't even blue beetles movie. It felt like he was a side character in his own movie. The story felt really flat and once again another villain with out purpose of being bad. It's just a flat boring superhero movie we've been getting for the past 5 years. The movie should've been about the scarab and introduce the reach who made it. Instead it felt more of his family origin story becoming ""heros"" instead of blue beetles origin. What we saw of him becoming blue beetles origin felt rushed. The best part about this movie was xolo and the suit. He did a great job for his first big screen appearance and he has a bright future. His sister wasn't that good at acting and neither was the mom. The father was great and George Lopez was alright. The Grandma was just eh. They made the movie too funny and oftentimes it was too much and forced. And there was too much propaganda in this film. I'm Mexican and Puerto Rican and it was too much. I was annoyed when they said the government has no problem with locking up Mexicans. It was just too much. And half of the time something that came out of George Lopezs mouth it was something about the government being against Mexicans.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","engfelipetulio","27 November 2023","The film, although it didn't significantly impact my life, fulfills the role of entertainment well. During the exhibition, there were no moments of deep reflection that changed my perspective on life, but that is not necessarily a negative thing. It was a great option to relax on a Sunday night, fulfilling its mission of providing entertainment.The performances were well executed, although some characters were not fully explored, showing a certain rush in presenting certain plot points. However, this aspect did not detract from the entertainment experience.As a Brazilian, I highlight the performance of actress Bruna Marquezine. She didn't compromise the film in any way and fulfilled her role well, which wasn't a basic role of a girl being saved by the hero. She had her moment.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","ogboiehioma","19 August 2023","From start to finish, blue beetle fails to deliver the excitement and engagement that one would expect from a superhero film. Despite the promise of epic battles and thrilling heroics, the movie falls flat in almost every aspect.The plot feels disjointed and lacks a clear sense of direction. The filmmakers attempt to incorporate multiple storylines and subplots, resulting in a cluttered narrative that's difficult to follow. This confusion extends to the characters, who lack depth and development. Even the titular superhero feels one-dimensional, making it hard to empathize or connect with their struggles.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of blue beetle is its failure to capitalize on the potential for social commentary that the superhero genre often offers. The movie seems content to stick to tired clich√©s rather than explore meaningful themes or address relevant issues.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","jakesolomonmeyer","21 August 2023","The budget appears to be very small for this movie. For being a movie, it fails to reach the level of most Marvel TV shows.Plot is mediocre.

Imagine watching each scene and knowing there should have been another take. I'm not kidding, thats how see through the acting is unfortunately.CGI is mediocre. Imagine the POV lens of Blue Beetle having Nintendo 64 graphics. That's what it looks like.The reason why I am giving it a 5 is because although it was not great, it was not terrible.

Especially considering they were able to bin the entire Batgirl film. Blue Beetle should have been scrapped before release. It's a terrible film.There are so many plot holes, that compact over and over again it's exhausting to even unravel. Blue Beetle is such a terrible character in the comics and now onscreen. The OMAC angle is such a tried motif. Yet it's needed because how else can you find a villain strong enough to challenge what is essential and invincible, indestructible scarab armour.Truly it's like watching Halle Berry's Catwoman with poor Susanne Sarandon playing the same lame character Sharon Stone played in said film. The whole thing is nauseating.This should have been produced as an animation and even then it would have been at least a desperate filler for 10 year olds on a plane ride.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","kayraurn","20 January 2024","First things first, Puerto Rican director Angel Manuel Soto doesn't break any new ground in terms of exploring the superhero genre in Blue Beetle. He and screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer stick to the A-Z formula of a superhero origin story. We have a young, down-on-his-luck protagonist (sounds familiar?). Then, his life takes an unexpected turn when he finds himself unwittingly becoming a superhero. He's reluctant, confused and has to face a bigger problem compared to what he has experienced in the past.And yet, the familiarity of the story has the added advantage of being the first Latino-led superhero movie. The good news is, Angel Manuel Soto, doesn't confine it as a mere, surface-level novelty factor. He treats it with respect by delving deep into the Latino culture, particularly in the importance of family relations and values seen in the Reyes.The Reyes in Blue Beetle is an immigrant family struggling to make a living in the poor neighbourhood of Palmera City. When the movie first introduced the Reyes, they are already in a dire financial situation. They are about to lose their home after Kord Industries decided to raise the rent to an exorbitant level. The only glimmer of hope right now is their adult son, Jaime (Xolo Maridue√±a), a pre-law graduate who just returns home to reunite with his family. He finds out about the problem and his dad's (Dami√°n Alc√°zar) health condition. He's eager to ease the family burden by hoping to land a lucrative job, only to end up settling with menial work alongside his younger sister, Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) as a maintenance and cleaning crew.The family dynamics angle gives the otherwise formulaic superhero movie a much-needed heart and soul. It's hard not to root for the likeable, tight-knit family like the Reyes such as Jaime's wacky and eccentric Uncle Rudy (George Lopez in a scene-stealing supporting role) and his beloved Nana played by the equally hilarious Adriana Barraza.Jaime's journey from being a nobody to a superhero may have been the same old superhero-movie cliches. But at least his story resonates well, thanks to Xolo Maridue√±a's charismatic and sympathetic lead performance. He shares great chemistry with the rest of the supporting cast playing the Reyes family members and so does he and Bruna Marquezine together.The latter plays Jenny Kord, the daughter of the late Ted Kord who founded Kord Industries before her scheming aunt, Victoria (the long-missed Susan Sarandon, who's clearly having fun chewing the scenery) takes over the business. Marquezine nails Jenny's spunky personality while her magnetic charm helps a lot in elevating her performance.Bruna Marquezine (middle) plays Jenny Kord in ""Blue Beetle"" (2023)Back to the story, Victoria is the one who found the mechanised alien artefact in the form of a blue scarab. Her goal is to draw an unlimited superpower from the scarab to activate her military-based creation of high-tech supersoldiers. Upon discovering her motive, Jenny tries to stop her by stealing the scarab. She subsequently entrusted the scarab to Jaime, who has no idea the level of trouble he's getting himself into. The scarab somehow chose Jaime as its host, where it embedded itself into his spine and even have him automatically equipped in a full-body armoured suit. He is also granted various powers and superhuman strength, complete with an inner voice (Becky G) known as Khaji-Da controlling and telling him what to do.Despite this being Angel Manuel Soto's first major big-budget Hollywood production, he manages to make good use of its reported US$120 million budget (believe it or not, Blue Beetle was originally slated for straight-to-Max streaming). The CGI isn't the greatest but decent enough without looking patchy and inferior (here's looking at you, The Flash). The director also showcased his excellent flair for well-choreographed action set pieces as he successfully brings Blue Beetle's multiple superpowers to life. Whether it was his impressive physical agility or taking down the bad guys with different types of weapons (one of them includes the heavily-promoted Final Fantasy VII video game reference), it's hard not to get immersed by Blue Beetle's superhero abilities.Blue Beetle also benefits from Bobby Krlic's catchy, '80s-style synthesiser score and an equally cool soundtrack. The movie even has a field day with its pop-culture references from the 1995 classic telenovela Maria la del Barrio to the superhero parody series of El Chapul√≠n Colorado. Given the less-than-stellar results of Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash, it's nice to see a DC movie, albeit an unlikely one like Blue Beetle is back on track. Several shortcomings aside such as Raoul Max Trujillo's one-note performance as Victoria's main enforcer, Conrad Carapax and the tedious third act, Blue Beetle remains a surprisingly entertaining, funny and heartfelt little package of a summer-movie blockbuster.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","sgguru","19 November 2023","The sound effects were about 3 seconds out of sync. Punches swing, wait for it..... sound effects of the hit come eons later. And what language were the actors speaking, Japanese? Russian? Certainly, Spanish words are being spoken but don't even sync with lip movements. They did a better job with Raymond Burr's dubbing over Japanese Godzilla in the 1950's. Whole family acts like idiots chanting and jumping around trying to get Jaime (hero) to open the box with the Scarab in it. Pathetic acting all around. If any of these actors thought that they were doing justice to their Mexican heritage, sorry they failed. I'm surprised that Susan Sarandon was so desperate as to lower herself to (act?) in this atrocity. Don't waste 2 hours of your life, watching this, even on MAX.

I don't mind a Hispanic hero but the way they portrayed the entire Hispanic portion of the cast was to take every stereotype you can think of and max them out. I can't believe the actors were not offended and did not quit. That is just one of many horrible things about this movie. The writing, the not scary at all villian lady, the way the writers had the characters constantly act and do incredibly stupid things, etc. I would say this is campy but it doesn't come across as a good campy.Thankfully I didn't pay for it, watched it free on max.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 August 2023","'Blue Beetle (2023)' is... actually pretty good? It's a bit of a weird one in the sense that it's exactly what you'd expect and it's even pretty janky in places, but it's pretty fun when it gets going (even while committing the same mistakes a lot of its peers have been making for the past two decades) and its emotionality is surprisingly resonant at times. You've seen it all before, for sure: a generic and slightly intangible origin story that focuses on heavy-handed themes of family (it might as well be an entry in the 'Fast and Furious' franchise) and has its hero eventually take on a baddie that's basically just a palette swap of them. Yet, there's just something that makes it more enjoyable than most of the other entries in the DCEU, an intangible charm that you can't quite put your finger on no matter how hard you try. The cast are mostly charismatic (the good guys, at least; Susan Sarandon is sleepwalking here and the main henchman is really boring), the comedy sometimes makes you chuckle (mostly thanks to George Lopez), the action is fairly energetic, and the messaging - as ham-fisted and often forced as it is - often leads to some shockingly affecting moments that make you realise how invested in the characters you must actually be. It's actually the latter that tips this into the solidly 'good' category for me, as a lot of the affair is middling to decent at best. It's honestly fairly forgettable, too. Overall, though, it just works way more than it ought to; it's better than the sum of its parts. It's not something I'm desperate to watch again, but it's far better than 'Black Adam (2022)' and it's a bit of a shame that it sits in this odd limbo between the existing DCEU and James Gunn's upcoming DCU. It's not going to cure your superhero fatigue, but it should entertain you if you're not tired of this stuff just yet.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","giovanni-grabski","18 August 2023","It's just that the movie is very, very, very generic. If you don't mind that, it's okay, but I'm tired of almost every superhero movie being the same thing.Additionally, the portrayal of the villain in the movie leaves much to be desired.The character lacks depth and originality, coming across as a mere clich√© rather than a compelling antagonist. This contributes to the overall sense of the film being generic.The plot follows a familiar pattern that has been seen in numerous superhero movies before. The storyline unfolds predictably, with little deviation from the standard narrative formula. From the hero's origin story to the inevitable clash between good and evil, every beat seems to adhere to a formulaic structure. While the action sequences are visually impressive, they fail to truly innovate or stand out from what we've seen in similar films. Explosions, dramatic showdowns, and CGI effects are all present, yet they lack the creativity that could elevate them beyond the ordinary.In a landscape where superhero movies dominate the cinema, it's disheartening to find that the majority fall into the trap of sameness.

"Blue Beetle","alindsayal","25 August 2023","DC is in a bit of a flux right now as they are between the end of DCEU and the start of the new DCU, but we have Blue Beetle now and I saw it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man become combined with an alien scarab that gives him special powers, this causes him to be hunted down by nefarious enemies.Main Character
Xolo Mariduena has been a young actor mainly known for his really good work on Cobra Kai. He plays Jaime Reyes here and he is great in the role. He brings plenty of vibrance to the role of Jaime and he nails the emotional scenes too. This is just a really likeable main character and I thought he did a really good job of being a lead for a character that I am pretty sure the majority of mainstream viewers no very little about.Supporting Characters
This has a large group of supporting characters and some of them work, some of them don't. Bruna Marquenzie plays Jenny Kord and is a big ally to Jaime Reyes, she was good in the film and I liked the chemistry between the two of them. It was nothing special, but it worked in this film and I think she has a pretty decent future ahead of her.This story really focuses on family, the main one being the Reyes family and all of them do a fantastic job in really building that bond. George Lopez is probably my favourite as his uncle and he provided the most laughs in the film. But all of them were great in their roles.But the villains of this film fell flat for me. Susan Sarandon plays Victoria Kord and she is just really dull, she doesn't really add much to this role. It's not that she is terrible or anything like that it is just she is the most forgettable part of the film. They try to give the other villain Carapax some character but it is way too late to get the impact that I think people wanted.Story
The best thing I can say about the story is that it is pretty functional. It does a good job with the Reyes family and how their bond strengthens Jaime and his ability as Blue Beetle with this linked to Jenny and her family it works too. But this is a really generic story, it would have been way better if it came out 15 years ago but we have seen everything here before in other films. It tries something towards the end of the film to rise it up but it doesn't quite work and makes the film feel a bit cheesy and predictable.Script
The script is okay, there is some decent humour and drama in there that makes this an entertaining watch. But sometimes, the humour feels a bit forced, I mean it feels like some of the weaker MCU films with comedy that doesn't quite work. The drama also is a mixed bag with some of it not really working in the context that they want.Style
The film looks pretty good. I like the design of the Blue Beetle suit, especially with it being a mostly practical suit, the film has some real exuberant colour and feel to it which is really great to see. Though, as I kind of mentioned before, the pacing and structure of the film doesn't quite work and is quite generic with a few lacklustre action scenes.Overall
Overall, Blue Beetle is an above average film. This is an entertaining watch, especially for a new character on the big screen, but it plays it pretty safe and never does enough to push itself into a better film. If you are interested in this film then I would say give it a chance, just don't expect the next Dark Knight.Rating - 6/10.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","lockout-59506","29 October 2023","Blue beetle being a lesser known hero of the DCU, had a chance at being a good movie. Unfortunately it doesnt live up to the hype and in several cases in sinks to much lower levels than expected.Not sure if its because of the times or what but I have lived ina heavily populated mexican area in SoCal for the last 20 years and most mexicans dont have a bad taste for America. Many are greatful for the opportunities and the life they have been able to build since moving here. Yet this movie portrays a dislike for the country and I have to believe its jumping on the train of ""America bad to foriegners"" narrative. Its sad to see as I Know a great deal of people who are fron outside this country that have real love and respect for what this nation representsIf its not the several disses towards the nation its the obnoxious sister that really drags down this movie. I also dont understand why all the superhero movies make the main character a clueless genius. Almost ever superhero movie in recent memory stars with a completely clueless character who at the same time is a genius and also has this witty side to them so they always have some quick comrback leaning on the comedic side. Most of it wasn't funny as is with most superhero movies.I could have predicted how this movie would play out which means I could have watched it in my heard rather than buying a ticket to see it. I honestly just want the superhero films to stop at this point. The industry has been over saturated with these films and they all just appear to be carbon copies of each other.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","Cinema-reviewer321","21 September 2023","I know enough about the Blue Beetle character from the comics to understand his origin in the movie, like who the character Jaime Reyes is and what the scarab that is the Blue Beetle suit; being interested in that they made a movie on the character. The DC movie Blue Beetle (2023) was fun and entertaining to watch, though it can be by the numbers when it comes to main antagonists, the main character and the actor playing the main character is what makes the me worth watching. Plus, along with the rest of the cast the movie is funny and like the comics it is based on.Actor Xolo Maridue√±a as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle was great as the character; he was likable, funny, and you root for him either going up against the main villain or dealing with money problems/finding a job after graduating from a university. The rest of Jaime Reyes's family was funny, played by great actors, and I liked how Jaime Reyes and his family worked together to deal with any problem that gets in their way; one of the family members that were especially funny was George Lopez as Jaime Reyes's uncle Rudy Reyes. Working with Jaime Reyes to keep the scarab away from the villain is Jenny Kord played by Bruna Marquezine who is the daughter of Ted Kord (the second Blue Beetle); I also thought she did a decent job and worked well with Xolo Maridue√±a as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle.One of the antagonists is Victoria Kord played by Susan Sarandon who is good in the movie, but she is a standard villain who wants the scarab for some sort of super soldier army she is creating because she runs Ted Kord's company because she is his sister. The other antagonist that works with Victoria Kord is Carapax played by Raoul Max Trujillo who is this super soldier she tested on and uses him to fight Blue Beetle, this character does have a backstory of some kind that is revealed at one point, so you know how he got like his now. The villains could have been better, but around that the movie can be entertaining with its action scenes, references to the comics, and a main character you like following.The Blue Beetle scarab looked cool, and I love that the suit is an actual practical effects suit with added CGI that blends very well making it cool to watch in the action sequences that are well done. The action scenes were nicely shot, with it not having a lot of cuts but instead having nice long shots where you can see the actor doing the stunts. The movie has stuff from the comics that people will notice if they know the comics, and the family aspect to the movie was enjoyable to watch, along with this being the first Mexican superhero that does a respectable job representing the culture and how Jaime Reyes and his family interact in their own way which was cool to see in this DC movie.Blue Beetle (2023) was a fun DC movie that I would recommend watching even if you do not know much about the character and comic books he comes from; though the antagonists and the plot might seem like something we have seen before, but Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle played by Xolo Maridue√±a makes the movie worth watching because he is a likable character. The movie was funny, it had good performances from the actors, great action, nice cinematography, and great effects on the scarab and Blue Beetle suit when using the many weapons that it can create making it entertaining; I would give this a watch when you can.","3/10"

"Blue Beetle","alvarez_milan","26 August 2023","I liked Xolo as the Beetle. The actual Beetle parts were good. Not the usual soundtrack for DC movies, but a good one. I also liked the connection with the ""original"" beetle.Sadly the whole ""Latin humor"" was too much, and the ""familia"" stuff was distracting and exaggerated. As a Mexican, I understood all the references, and there were several moments I laughed at the jokes, but got to the point it was just plain ridiculous. Also, the whole thing of the ""abuela"" acting as a ""revolutionary"" it's very anachronistic and grotesque.I like the idea of a ""Hispanic"" hero in the DC Comics universe , but I hope they realize they over did it.Yes the Beetle character in the comics was funny, yes the funny gist worked with Shazam, but in this movie it just went too far. If this is how the Gunn universe is starting... I am not very excited about it.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","cherold","6 January 2024","It's hard to know where to begin with the problems of Blue Beetle, but I'll offer a few examples.* It's mainly a family sitcom for the first half hour. After a brief, unintriguing scene with Susan Sarandon we meet a nice family who joke and argue and face challenges and it just goes on and on.* The sitcom format adapts poorly to the actual events. This is most obvious in the first superhero transformation, which is a body-horror moment played as silly comedy. It's weirdly incongruent to combine someone going through an objectively terrifying moment as though it's a very special episode about getting your first zit.* The action is unacceptable. I mean, sometimes very mediocre superhero movies will still have one or two knock-out action sequences, but not this one.Some people say the public is beginning to weary of superhero movies, and movies like this will do nothing to change that.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","ezzy_ezzy","16 October 2023","I hate how when these type of movies attempt to include a new race of superhero, that they have to show that the family is funny, and its the american who is the villain, ya know to include the new viewers and show how diverse we are. I am all up for an hispanic hero, but to try and make humour of their family culture and turn the family into a charictature of stereotype. Why not just focus on the main character. We do not need to know that he is living in poverty, it is just so paint by numbers. I believe if this came out in the 90s it would of been a blockbuster. Nothing in this feels original. It is like Venom, but in neon pink and blue. More of the same. I do not want more of the same any more. The rest of the world does not want more of the same. So why do they serve us this? Ditch the stereotyping, the humour, tone it down.","10/10"
"Blue Beetle","mharpesr","18 November 2023","The is a remake of The Greatest American Hero. The hero is usable to grasp the power and control of the gift he has received. Consequently his family loses everything and the hero can't help them until the very end. The majority of the movie is the hero dolting about making grunting and groaning noises whining about his predicament. His sister is a self entitled fool that you feel like choking after the fiset 10 minutes. I was amazed at the poor direction and inconsistency. If your about 4 years old or there abouts, this movie is probably for you. But if your expecting something like Iron Man or Spider-Man you will be sadly disappointed.","8/10"

Starting from the corky colors going through the terrible script to the unbelievably bad acting.The plot is not original in any way. You can vaguely see what the creators were going for but they ended up with bits and pieces of scenes that look too familiar to another superhero film(s) accompanied with some of the worst CGI work of the year..
I was mostly annoyed throughout the whole film..
No idea who would find this film amusing!My rating is 3/10 for the good performance from Raoul Trujillo and some good camera movement work in a couple of scenes.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","eddie_baggins","27 September 2023","An up and coming director, a bright young star in his first major Hollywood leading role, a move from a direct to streaming release to the wide world of cinema and bought to life in a colourful 80's like sheen, everything appeared to be relatively promising for Blue Beetle to buck the recent DC cinematic trend of dire box office results and middling to poor critical responses but despite some oddly kind reviews, Angel Manuel Soto's newest entry into the comic box landscape is a mostly DOA prospect that loses its charm well before the credits appear.A well-liked if far from commonly popular character in the DC space, Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle isn't exactly the biggest name brand character they've unleashed on the movie going public and in many ways gave the struggling comic empire a chance to really go for it and deliver something unexpected on willing audiences but despite some early fun and a creative setting in the fictional location of Palmera City, Soto's films unique flavour and eclectic cast of characters can't sustain much momentum past the opening 30 - 40 minute mark as it falls into a rather pedestrian ride that offers very little in the way of memorable set pieces or story elements.In some ways sitting a little outside of the usual origin story box that has been opened countless times before in such comic book feature films, Blue Beetle doesn't waste much time early on introducing us to Xolo Maridue√±a recent college graduate Jaime Reyes and his full of life family (including a scene chewing George Lopez) and before we know it we are off to Kord Industries, overseen by Susan Sarandon's generic CEO baddie Victoria Kord, where who would've guessed it, Reye's unknowingly unlocks an alien power courtesy of a mysterious alien scarab that has chosen him as its earthly host, creating the superhero of Blue Beetle in the process.What follows on from here is all boorishly predictable as the films Latino flavour and exuberance is overshadowed by comic book movie 101 staples that feel like they are at loggerheads with what Blue Beetle was aiming to achieve by breathing fresh life into a stale genre through its use of a culture that has so far not played major roles in the superhero space of the last few decades.The whole affair feels like one of those experiences that was at war within itself to become the film it wanted to be and there are times where Soto's undoubted directional talent is on display, Maridue√±a's natural charisma shines through and the films 80's essences including The Haxan Cloak's score and Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography gets things feeling like we are heading somewhere really positive and unexpected but too much of Blue Beetle feels like nothing more than a rehashed product hiding under the guise of something more, leading to another missed opportunity for DC who now has a final shot under the leadership of James Gunn to get things right.Final Say -A feature that would've been better off sticking to its streaming release rather than being pushed to the cinema where it has crashed and burned at the box office, Blue Beetle may be hard to hate with its heart in the right place but it's nothing more than another stale and magic free affair DC was hoping it could disguise.2 gun toting grandmas out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","10/10"

Nobody in the theater laughed at the corny jokes and I couldn't care less about any of the cringe and annoying characters.

"Blue Beetle","KenKenReviews","19 August 2023","The highlight of this film is its heart. To do that they made the whole family central to the movie which then made Jaime not feel so much like a main character despite having the suit. There were some big characters that happen to over shadow him. Nana Reyes was hilarious and the MVP alongside Rudy Reyes. So, it added and took away from the film, if that makes sense. I got a bit teary eyed I can admit. The mix of English and Spanish really drove the authenticity of the emotional scenes. They were centred around grief, loss and pain. They were few and they were impactful. Throwing some throw backs in to compliment the past Blue Beetles was pretty cool too.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","The-Sarkologist","15 December 2023","Well, this happens to be another one of those superhero films in a world that seems to be awash with superhero films. In fact, it seems to have landed up in the transition between the old DCEU and the new DCU. Yeah, there seems to be a lot of these multi-film universes. The problem that I find with a lot of these superhero films that that you need to have an origin story, and then have a vague example of a plot as well. The other thing is that they seem to be trying to build up a catalogue of non-white/non-male superheros. In this instance we have a Mexican superhero.One of the good things about this film is that it gives us an insight into the world of the latin-American minority in the US. Like, we have the kid who comes back from college yet the only job he can get is cleaning the house of the main antagonist. There is also the idea that the world of the immigrant (particularly the illegal-immigrant) and the world of the the successful white people. Then there is also the idea that one health issue can bankrupt a family, and being caught up in an unpredictable rental market.However, while there are some interesting aspects to the film, it is really just fairly typical of your average superhero film. Like, we have the artifact that turns the user into a superhero, and that the artifact will basically choose who they wish to give the abilities to. Mind you, there is also the corporate boss that wants the artifact to basically control the world, or at least make themselves really really rich.Well, okay, there were some good things about this film, and there is also that foreshadowing at the beginning of the film about the poor boy being lifted out of poverty through the support of a wealthy patron. As is typical with this type of film, there is also a romantic development between the superhero. Mind you, there is also the suggestion that there was an older Blue Beetle who seemed to be another one of those ultra-rich individuals who decided to become a superhero.Yeah, as I said, it wasn't a bad film, and I did like the concept of exploring the struggles of the immigrants in modern America, but not even that but how harsh and unforgiving life the United States can be. However, we also have this ironic thing that they happen to be rescued from poverty by an angel which, sadly, doesn't happen all that often. As I said, yeah, as a film it wasn't bad, and I enjoyed it, but there wasn't much depth to it beyond that.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","GomezAddams666","20 August 2023","In the midst of the DC inside turmoil and the SAG-AFTRA, WGA strikes, Angel Manuel Soto had to promote the movie he directed without any of its actors, and after the great disappointment that The Flash was, Warner Brothers Discovery needed a good movie to lift themselves up, and they succeeded admirably.Xolo Maridue√±a is perhaps better known as Miguel Diaz on Netflix's Cobra Kai, but he also excels at brining Jaime Reyes to life. Maridue√±a is a very charming and talented actor, who has proven he could lead an entire movie. His boy-ish naivete helps him melt into Jaime, a recent College Graduate that needs to find a job to support his family.This job hunt leads Jaime into the Kord family war, but more specifically to Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine).Jenny wants to prevent her aunt Victoria Kord from harnessing alien power in order to create indestructible and unbeatable mercenaries. That alien technology has been in their family for decades, and it is one that Jenny's father, Ted Kord studied most of his life until his disappearance.The Scarab is a sentient being that once it chooses its host, it provides them with an exoskeleton that can withstand many attacks ad create whatever weapon the host can imagine.But of course, what comic book movie would be complete without a villain? And this film has two.The first one being Ignacio Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo), a Guatemalan soldier recruited as a child to fight communist in the area, and who also became the first test subject of the OMAC, which is a suit powered by the Scarab, and its name means One-Man Army Corps. Producing this in mass to the United States Government would be a great win for Kord Industries and its CEO, Victoria Kord.Carapax however is not a one-note villain. We can see that he lost his mother due to civil unrest in Guatemala, and as mentioned before he was recruited as a child by the United States into becoming a weapon to fight communism. He is a tragic villain, one that you can feel sympathy for.But the undisputable villain here is Victoria Kord. Played by the ever-amazing Susan Sarandon, Victoria is a woman with a vision.Victoria and her father created Kord industries from the ground, they created a company that would manufacture weapons of mass destruction, and she would even go into countries affected by them to report on the success of their terrible merchandise.But when her father passed away, he left the company to Victoria's brother, Ted Kord, which infuriated Victoria into a corporate takeover once Ted disappeared out of thin air, and having the Scarab in her hands would not only mean her father was wrong, but she would also stop at nothing to harness its powers, even if it means killing children or entire families ""for the greater good"".Under less-capabale hands a character like Victoria Kord could have easily be cartoonish in a James Bond villan-esque kind of way, but Sarandon is amazingly scary in the role, which she does not allow to go into camp territory.Blue Beetle has a great supporting cast in the Reyes family, with actors such as George Lopez, Dami√°n Alc√°zar, Adriana Barraza, Elipidia Carrillo and Belissa Escobedo as Jaime's sister, Milagro.Not only do I bring it up because they are amazing actors, but also because their presence makes the movie that much better.This film is about a reluctant Latino hero who gets his strength from the love of his family, it is an emotional roller coaster from beginning to end, and as I mentioned at the beginning Xolo Mardue√±a is amazing on every scene he's in.The director of Blue Beetle, Angel Manuel Soto has given DC fans the hero we need in these times of uncertainty. This was perhaps the absolute best comic book movie I have seen in years.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","martinpersson97","24 November 2023","The DCU is, of course, rather hit and miss, and in many ways somewhat of a worse ripoff of the Marvel films.This one, however, is definitely a standout and one of the better. Which is not to say it is an incredible film, of course. It does suffer from some of the similar issues of the other films, but overall it is a pretty good and fun action adventure.The effects are pretty good, though at the same time somewhat obvious CGI in some scenes - and it features some pretty neat cinematography, cutting and editing.The actors all do a good job at conveying it. The villain, in typical fashion, remains somewhat underdeveloped, but this is of course not the first time that has happened.Overall, I would say this is a recommended DC film, in the same vein of The Flash or Wonder Woman. It works as a pretty good adventure overall, if one of the last of the old DCU.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","SAMTHEBESTEST","17 August 2023","Blue Beetle (2023) :
Movie Review -Blue Beetle Review: DC Studios latest superhero drama, Blue Beetle, marks √Ångel Manuel Soto's debut in the superhero genre. DC has been looking to turn the tide for a while and has had a few impressive successes recently, especially with Joker and The Batman. Blue Beetle is fresh stuff, alright, but does it really matter if superhero theories are old? A new suite and powers are enough? I guess Not. It's not just DC; Marvel too is suffering from an insufficiency of new conflicts and thrills. It's just that earlier we used to get one or two superhero movies a year; now we get a lot of them, and that too after watching so much stuff already. Blue Beetle is funny with Mexican humour-that's new! The suit, theme, and powers are also quite new. Though the film lacks newness in storytelling. We all know how one gets power and tries to use it while tackling dangers, doing romance, and saving family. Blue Beetle is that mixture again, with some tech talk we have been seeing from Iron Man, Wayne, and Hulk for years. Nevertheless, it's a promising start for a new superhero, if that's what you're looking for.The film begins with Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridue√±a) returning home after graduation, and he learns that his family is gonna lose the house in Palmera City. He is fired from a job by Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) while trying to save Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine) amidst an argument. Jenny might have a job for him, and he visits Kord's office to meet her. Jenny gives him a Scarab to protect, which is childishly opened by his family. Jaime is now chosen to become a symbiotic host to the Scarab, an ancient alien biotechnological relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armour, turning him into the superhero ""Blue Beetle"". Victoria and her bodyguard robot, Conrad (Raoul Max Trujillo) are after the code of Blue Beetle, which jointly puts Jaime's family in danger. Jaime and Kha-Ji must work together to protect the family and the code, but will it be enough?Coming as a fresh film, Blue Beetle has no load of expectations. So even if it's underwhelming at parts, it still doesn't bother you much. It can't be the same when you watch The Batman or Superman movies because they are hugely popular superheroes and their films come with certain baggage. The screenplay of Blue Beetle is the main concern, as it deals with new ideas in old ways. It's 2023, and we are still being fed two decades-old conflicts. Why? The building collapses, but the Hero wouldn't be hurt, or even the heroine, even if there is large destruction right around her. One of the family members must get hurt so that the Hero can get angry and unleash his powers. In no time, the hero and heroine would come close to kissing each other, and someone would enter the room. Don't you dare ask when they fell in love. It's just there. Don't tell me you haven't been familiar with all these things, because if you are not, Blue Beetle is going to feed all of them for the first time. But if you have tasted them before, then this might get you away from the table in no time.The handsome Xolo Maridue√±a will be the girls favourite soon, at least as a crush. He has that personality and kindness in his natural role as Jaime Reyes. But as Blue Beetle, he is still immature. That's what the course of his character demands, by the way. Raoul Max Trujillo has been pretty impressive as the antagonist here. He might have only a few scenes to show his face and act, but he is damn good there. The female baddie played by Susan Sarandon didn't look evil at all, but you know why. It's just that female touch that makes things difficult for her. Jaime's love interest, Bruna Marquezine, is cute but nothing that can be remembered or even discussed. Surprisingly, all the family members of Jaime seem to have a blast. Dami√°n Alc√°zar, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, and Belissa Escobedo have rocked more as a unit than as individuals. Harvey Guill√©n's Sanchez goes unnoticed until before the last lines, when he speaks in Mexican.Talking about the visual effects, Blue Beetle is your old laser show put together with high-tech weapons. Some of the destruction scenes look grand on the big screen without any 3D effects. The cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski is fine, whereas Craig Alpert's edit keeps the crispness intact. Technically, it's a well-made film, no doubt, considering the $120 million budget. The studio took good care of the production design, as nothing really looked outdated or ugly here. However, Blue Beetle needed a little brainstorming on the paper, which is clearly missing. Of course, you don't expect a typical superhero entertainer to be a smart and intelligent film, but what's wrong with being a bit more clever? √Ångel Manuel Soto's storytelling is well-versed in your regular superhero flicks that you have been enjoying over the years. He makes you a simple popcorn entertainer when the world is getting more advanced with multiverses and emotionally powerful tales. Could he have done better? Yes, I guess so. Blue Beetle isn't a bad film at all, but it isn't great enough to be recommended. It's just a matter of your expectations, whether you want to go for it desperately or not. But yes, it can be viewed once for a fresh attempt in the money-spinning genre.RATING - 5/10*","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","DarkVulcan29","11 September 2023","After the movie The Flash, I had very little hope for any future movie based on DC comics. But I wanted to give Blue Beetle the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad I did.Jaime (Cobra Kai's Xolo Mariduena) a college graduate tries to help his family that are struggling, by taking a job for a rich company, but ends up getting attached to a alien device titled the Scarab, and becomes the superhero Blue Beetle. Will Jaime embrace the hero he was destined to be?Better DC movie than The Flash. But I must say Blue Beetle has a lot of heart to it, not just making Blue Beetle the main focus, but making the other characters shine as well. Even scene stealers like George Lopez and Susan Sarandon. The effects are really good, and has awesome superhero battles. I hope to see more Blue Beetle films in the future.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","hengtheslinger","22 August 2023","The 3 stars that I gave are entirely for the Blue Beetle suit and power concept. Plotwise, it's so so so terrible, cliche, and cringey. I could predict almost everything, this movie seems like a copy of Shang-Chi, even the jokes üôÑ.The main character is so dumb, stupid, and cringey, he could've used the power to his advantage, but even with power, he still looks like powerless dude who needs constant helps from ordinary people, when others kill his family ruthlessly, he still couldn't muster up courage to kill the enemy, he's a stupid and cringey coward.The side characters are also cliche and cringey. He just has that one family member who constantly looka for troubles.The villains are right up super cringey. Nothing is new except for power concept (it's actually nothing surprising but looks kinda cool), the writing is just down right bad. The shooting itself is also SMH, as always, DC movies are always shot without lights, and it's hard to watch for some parts(especially the part they fight in the air).It could be a somewhat acceptable movie if it was released over 10 years ago, but I doubt the writer could make it good, after all, he still copied from other movies now.","4/10"

While it was better than I expected, they could have made it great, and set it apart from every other superhero story. The family dynamic was good, but there's a lot of corny jokes, just like every coming of age superhero movie. They could have made it more serious and dramatic. They should have explored the suits abilities more. They could have made a better villain. They could have tried something other than the same old ""going up against someone with similar powers but they are evil/brainwashed"" trope. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, but it's definitely not going to change any minds about the genre.","1/10"

There is so much time wasting scenes in this movie it gets extremely boring. The character are either screaming, whining or making unfunny jokes. The 'hero' is pretty pathetic and whiny the whole way through. Gets superhero powers and starts whining and complaining that his life is changed forever. Get a grip! Anyone in that situation would be pretty happy with that situation. Also whoever cast the 'villain' lady needs to be fired. About as threatening as Blue Beetles granny. Was surprised they didn't have a boss battle with the two granny's at the end.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","neil-476","24 August 2023","Newly-graduated Jaime Reyes returns to his family, living in a poor section of a city where the wealthy are gradually encroaching. He gets a menial job with his sister Milagro at a hotel, which he promptly loses, fired by Victoria Kord, CEO of Kord Industries. Jaaime was sticking up for Jenny Kord, daughter of missing previous CEO Ted Kord, and she subsequently slips him a mysterious item which Victoria wants back, and she is prepared to get it.As a superhero origin story, this is perhaps fairly routine, albeit perfectly functional and a decent enough story in its own right - someone trying to cope with new tech which is beyond their experience is a well-worn trope, but with plenty of scope for humour, for instance. But Jaime's family add a lot of texture and heart to this movie. They are nicely and strongly characterised, and there are some great and emotional moments featuring them. They are not strictly necessary to the plot, arguably, but they strongarm their way in and demand a place.If I have a criticism of this film, it is that there is a lot of dialogue in subtitled Spanish. I have no problem with this, and it's a good thing that a big-budget super-hero movie is built around a heavily Hispanic character/cast, but I know there is a not insignificant chunk of audience who dislike reading subtitles. So, on the one hand maybe this is restricting the film's audience. On the other, Everything Everywhere All At Once, right?","2/10"

The story I liked and I hoped that it would be good but DC can't figure out how to make a good movie for anyone other than a 12 year old audience.DC needs to go to Marvel's office and take serious notes, stop turning good stories into awful movies.

"Blue Beetle","fredschaefer-406-623204","20 August 2023","What was once known as the DCEU (the DC Comics Extended Universe) is rapidly coming to an end, and for most fans it is definitely with a whimper. Its fate was sealed earlier this year when Warner Brothers announced that director James Gunn had been hired to reboot the entire DC superhero line starting with a new Superman film due to be released in 2025. The remaining projects were pretty much up the creek as far as fans were concerned, as they essentially represented a dead end universe. One of the those films was the big screen debut of the Jamie Reyes's incarnation of the Blue Beetle, a super hero whose roots go back a long way to Charlton comics, and whose suit has been worn by more than one hero.So, separating BLUE BEETLE from all the bad vibes surrounding it, is the film any good? For me, it is a qualified ""yes,"" starting with the basic plot, which is a pretty rote by the numbers superhero origin story. A piece of alien tech in the form of a scarab, which, naturally is coveted by a weapons manufacturing corporation, bonds with a recent college graduate named Jamie Reyes, forming a symbiotic relationship and giving him a suit of armor that bestows Jamie with some pretty awesome, though ill defined, powers. He's basically a Green Lantern, except he's Blue, and he's not part of any corp. The first third of the film sets up the circumstances of how the alien tech falls into the hero's hands; the middle section has him transform into the Blue Beetle and go through a learning curve with his powers; the finale has Jamie captured by the evil Kord Industries, who wants what he took from them back, but the challenge is overcome with the help of Jamie's family and new girlfriend. Any comic book fan will recognize the plot turns and character beats from any number of classic origin stories, be they DC or Marvel.What gives BLUE BEETLE some juice and sets it apart from some other recent DCEU and MCU films is that it really has a lot heart, and was clearly made by people who liked and respected the character, and was true to the core of what made him popular. Director Angel Manuel Soto and screen writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer have given the story a very distinct Latin flavor, and infused it with a POV from that culture, which gives it a certain energy which makes it stand apart. The main supporting cast consists of Jamie's loyal and loving extended family, which consists of his parents, sister, grand-mother, and a wacky uncle who has no filter. At times it feels as if the family scenes are right out of a sitcom, especially when George Lopez's Uncle Rudy says anything. And one might be forgiven for thinking that the loud and boisterous Latin family has become a real trope. Still, it's a different track for a super hero film and it works, and tropes are not necessarily bad when they are used with sincerity. Jamie's scenes with his family really are the best part of the film. It's diversity without it feeling like box-checking marketing. Another thing I liked was the absence of the kind of snarky humor that has invaded a lot of films over in the MCU (best example being THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER), this film has plenty of humor, and though not all of it works, it's not annoying, and not a deal breaker.Which leaves a lot that is average at best, starting with the CGI, of which there is a lot of in this film, along with big helping of comic book logic-like when Uncle Rudy is just able to sit down and hack into one of Kord Industries computers just because he has ""skills."" The Big Bad of the film is Victoria Kord, played by Susan Sarandon, and she is not very good playing the kind of one dimensional CEO villain (another trope) that has been a part of popular culture for decades, especially since the Great Recession. Sarandon is given some very unsubtle and clunky dialogue designed to show just how rapaciously villainous she is, though Raoul Max Trujillo as her main enforcer, Carapax, manages to project some Danny Trejo in his prime menace. There are the usual shallow jabs at capitalism and colonialism that are worked into every comic book film these days. And there are a few moments that made my eyes roll, as when the grand-mother, played by Adriana Barraza, wields a machine gun as if she was Jesse Ventura in PREDATOR. The scene where Xolo Mariduena's Jamie transforms feels like it was lifted right out of VENOM, and when we are shown how his armor works from his POV, it resembles similar scenes from IRON MAN.I do wonder if the character of Blue Beetle would have been better if introduced in something like a YOUNG JUSTICE film, though there is little chance that a project like that would be green lighted as Warner Brothers these days. I do agree with those who have suggested that BLUE BEETLE probably would have been a blockbuster if it had been made a decade ago before its type of superhero story had been run into the ground. James Gunn has said the character will be part of his DCU going forward and that is certainly possible as Superman, Batman, and The Flash are mentioned in passing, thus firmly establishing that Jamie Reyes exists in a DC Universe, maybe one that is yet to be defined. I definitely think the film benefited by not having any other DC heroes make fan service cameos-there is a mid-credits scene, but it concerns a plot thread that is firmly set inside the Blue Beetle story canon.All in all, I think BLUE BEETLE has a tighter story than THE FLASH, a much firmer grip on its title hero than BLACK ADAM, and it has to be way better than SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, which I didn't bother to see. If it the better DC super hero film of the last few years, than that is only because the bar has been set low. Still, Xolo Mariduena's Jamie Reyes, and his alter ego, deserves another shot no matter what the final fate of this film may be.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","viviancym90","20 August 2023","Never written any review but I just had to for this one. I felt asleep halfway through the movie in cinema. First of all, actors are poorly casted especially blue beetle himself, from start to end his acting cringed me to the bone. Everyone else speaks like train, even when those scenes where you're supposed to have deeper emotions, to empathise with the characters' stories and feelings...but all of them speak without much emotions and pauses like they never process some feelings first before they speak/act. I wanted to see actions from protagonist but this film decided to go with family troop kind of avengers fighting they way out instead. This feels like a combination of spider man and hulk, but the plot is below average IMO. Was expecting a better performance from Susan Sarandon well at least she's the only one I know from the entire movie but her villain evil side wasn't played out well. Don't waste your time unless you just need to watch a movie to kill time.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","ruano-mike","23 September 2023","This is essentially a kids movie with a big budget and the same old message: poor people are victims, rich white people are villains, and family makes you strong. The story could have easily been from any straight to DVD kids superhero movie you'd find in at a truck stop. It's so bad that you end up not caring about the characters or what's happening because your not a 5yo child who is mesmerized by the bright colors and fight scenes. I'm not sure if that was what the movie was meant to be or if the marketing was off but it misses the mark when compared to other DC superhero movies. For those that rated a 10 I would recommend ""Shark boy and lava girl"" that seems like something you'd enjoy.","10/10"

"Blue Beetle","parksiet","30 August 2023","Blue Beetle is the superhero movie the genre needs right now. In a sea of tired, CGI-filled cameo-fests that are only focused on building out their multiverses than telling a good story... Blue Beetle is a refreshing reminder of why we fell in love with comic book films in the first place. Yes, it is a blend of Iron Man (the suit & powers), Spider-Man (the character), and Ms Marvel (the family dynamic)... but it just works so well. It's a little too silly and cringe at times with a somewhat cliche story, but it's just so charming and has so much heart you can't help but enjoy it! A huge surprise for me - turned out to be one of the better DC films!","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","carlos-pires","29 September 2023","The most ridiculous super-hero ever. Full of clich√©s, but a fun watch with great pacing and a great ending.For starters, this is apparently a super-hero for Mexicans (Hispanics, eventually? Sorry: I can't never get my head around American race wars). It's only natural that global conglomerates finally start to act locally (remember the ""think global, act local"" motto from the 1990's?...) However, everything in the story was either started or developed by Americans (Ted Kord - the good brother, and Susan Sarandon's character - the bad sister)... which means that although it LOOKS made for Mexicans, it kind'a has a ""colonialist"" after-taste.Anyway, if I was a Mexican I would feel deeply insulted by the depiction of this caricature of a Mexican family, as it's wrong in so many ways (from the multiple instances of embarrassing public behavior of the whole family to the depiction of the grandma in the brink of an orgasm while shooting people with what looks like a Nintendo version of a Gatling gun).Anyway, let's get into specifics.First of all, the whole saga starts off with the all-too-common unwitting-and-unwilling hero who is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Fine... But there is a little twist in it: his fat sister with eyeglasses (a double clich√©) is the stupid one who actually starts everything. She's the one responsible for effing up her brother's homecoming with bad news (when explicitly told by everyone else in the family NOT to do it), then goes on to get herself and her brother fired because she wanted to take a dump in the boss's toilet (?!), then she acts like a child and manages to unleash this alien drone that goes up her brother's behind and gets the whole story in motion... then later she's the one responsible for their dad's fatal heart attack! Somehow, nobody cares that this stupid chick just screws everything up.On the other end of the racial+social spectrum, the rich girl is always saying ""Sorry! Sorry!"" even though she didn't do anything wrong and explicitly told the dude to not mess with the effing scarab in the first place...
Is this the current zeitgeist? Are we, as viewers, supposed to think that it is OK to be a dimwit who ruins everything if you are a girl? A poor girl? A fat girl? A girl with glasses? All of the above? Are we supposed to think that anyone who is born into poverty should be excused of everything, from being fired to getting their dad an heart attack (or getting their brother sodomized by an alien drone)? Are we supposed to think that anyone who is born into wealth must be constantly apologizing even to the stupid idiots who screw up everything by ignoring every warning?All this is deeply disturbing if you think about it. I rather not, but I'm still aware of it and I can't avoid mentioning it. But let's move on...More clich√©s:
1. Nowadays we use tons of software applications that have several deployments per day without the need for a ""reboot"", but still... highly evolved alien technology beyond human comprehension always has to ""reboot"" at some plot point. And it has to take several minutes, so that the bad guys get a fighting chance.2. ""Good"" is always blue, ""bad"" is always red. Hollywood is like paint by numbers.3. The bad guy looks exactly like a Gundam robot or something out of Power Rangers. I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of copyright lawsuits are coming up their way.4. The good guy is such a sucker that he always refuses to shoot to kill, even after seeing his family under live gunfire, and his dad dying. I guess this is supposed to be a ""family movie"", so lethal action is dialed down to a minimum. (although this gets an exception near the end of the movie, which is completely out of character and blatantly just for the sake of that specific plot point...)
5. The ""sentient alien technology"" has a sexy female voice.Bottom line: this is a highly flawed movie, with some disturbing undertones you should be aware of, but it is actually very entertaining due to very good craftsmanship from everyone involved. Particularly, the production design, direction, editing and acting are very good, and the pacing is perfect. Plus, you get a (predictable but) gratifying ending.Regardless of the above criticism, if you're into superhero movies then you surely got to see this one.","8/10"
"Blue Beetle","Rich-Lee-Bailey","27 September 2023","I was extremely looking forward to this film having seen the trailers but like most films, the trailers had more action than the actual film.DC has a lot of great characters but warners brothers really don't know how to monopolise and bring life to these characters.Firstly, this aunt has looked years for this beetle but after finding it, it's in a room with one geek guy without a guard in sight to protect it.The uncle whose given no back story suddenly has this heavy tech equipment without any explanation as to why he has it, or what it was for; not even some simple explanation like he's a paranoid physicist, uses this tech to disable a high tech company that's been around for years and should have state of the art security tenfold to what this random uncle can do.This same uncle then goes on to fly some beetle ship that he's never been in.This grandma who looks more fragile than a McDonald's chip is able to carry a gun the same size as her and knows how to instantly use it, just because she was rebel back in the day.The kid in the beetle suit gets told he has to live with this amazing body armour that will protect him his whole life and he turns around and gets all sad about that, I mean come on! When Peter Parker realise he could shoot webs, he was ecstatic!!Warner brothers should just give their rights away to someone who will actually respect DC. Even a guy in a comic shop could create something better than this...Such a shame.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","johannes2000-1","25 November 2023","Sure, I had a fine time with this entertaining movie, but in the end it did leave a slight feeling of disappointment and missed opportunities. On the positive side: the story is reasonably involving, the pace is high (when after a slow start the action kicks in), and the CGI is absolutely great. There's lots of humor, and Xolo Maridue√±a is a sympathetic and good-looking main character Jaime. On the other hand the story is far from original: it's more or less a blueprint of Spiderman's beginnings, with an unsuspecting average teen who gets in a weird way infected, thus becoming to his own amazement a super hero with all kinds of superpowers that he has to learn to control, while at the same time chasing a heinous villain that of course threatens the world. So nothing new there.As said, Jaime is sympathetic, but for the rest his persona is totally blank and nondescript, lacking every inch of character. His family is endearing, but with all their hilarious actions they're made into some kind of slapstick, on the brink of getting tiresome. The romance between innocent clueless Jaime and Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), a worldwise heiress of a business imperium, is totally unrealistic. Susan Sarandon is a fine actress, but for a supervillain she's just too much a nicely dressed old lady, lacking all the exuberant evilness that you expect of a DC villain.In hindsight it all impressed me as a superhero-light, tailored for kids, a bit like a live-action version of a Cartoon Network movie. Nothing wrong with that, and amusing enough, but don't expect anything more or deeper.","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","michelleg-98783","28 August 2023","Reading through these reviews I can tell they're completely missing the point of this movie.. Is this another superhero movie where the main character gets super powers through an alien artifact? Yes. But it goes BEYOND that. All superhero movies value romance and somewhat family but Blue Beetle does it justice when they talk about family.Being Mexican-American myself and growing up in white America this story touched my heart. I saw myself and my family in these characters and our struggles being put up on the big screen. Many people fail to realize that the Mexican community lived for the American dream. Our parents, and grandparents picked up everything they had on their shoulders and left their homes behind in order to find a better life for themselves and their children. Nowadays, the world is fastly changing under our feet and as the rich become richer, we get pushed out as the movie shows.This story is important for representation to our community. It's filled with comedic monologues and objects our community values. We as a Latino community value family over everything, especially living in the U. S. as long as we got family, we can always figure it out. I loved how they tackled the romance, it's not overly pushed in your face, it's gentle and natural how it grows throughout the film.Lastly, the cast was outstanding their dynamic was well put together. Their chemistry was amazing everyone represented an important role and performed great.As my title says this is a win for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans living in the U. S. Its a great film when you better understand who this movie was made for. This is an amazing movie for the whole family, give it a chance!!","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","confirmeddeath","23 September 2023","When you go to a restaurant, there are options.Each option is unique because they know that if all the options are barely different then you'll simply get tired of their food and go somewhere else...These superhero movies by DC and Marvel is the same garbage over and over again. This was a waste of my time.Kid gets superpower and he goes ""Oh no, how do I get rid of this inconvenience, all I wanted was to get a job and work for the rest of my life so I could pay off my debts""
Then after all of that comes the ""Oh no, I'm not a killer"" So now we have to watch a fight between this loser hero beating the same guy 50 times just for the sake of ""action"" because ""action"" supposedly sells...You see, when your family is at risk, there is absolutely nothing you wouldn't do to protect them, but these bs scripts ... I don't know, they are made for imbeciles. Their ""No killing"" bs leads to more people dying, but that's ok because the ""Hero"" is ""innocent"".Aren't people getting tired of this same crap soup over and over again?","2/10"
"Blue Beetle","clarkkent19381123","19 August 2023","Over the years DC has dropped the ball on so many flimsy and I don't know if that is because WB gets involved or if there are too many hands in the pot but FINALLY they got one right. Blue bettle is superbly done. Amazing visuals and the cast has so much chemistry. Xolo does an outstanding job in the lead role and you would think the kid has been in dozens of movies. The poly is straight forward and easy enough to follow or at least connect the dots. The light hoarded comedy glades back to other films but so many jokes stand on it own so there is no comparison. This is the flim DC got right since Aquaman. This is the film James Gunn should center around. A simply amazing movie even if you are not familiar with Blue Bettle you can still walk in and pick up the story and character but for the hardcore fans there are plenty of throwback references to catch throughout the film. Overall the rating should be a lot higher as this is a great family movie.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","louis-loh","30 October 2023","100% cringeworthy material. I'm not saying Marvel is perfect or even great, but the things they do well (arguably not consistently so) are character development and dialogue. BB just kicks the bar down to a new low - the humour is witless and crass, the characters behave like cartoons, the plot is uninspiring and predictable, the character development is non-existent, the racial/matriarchal/patriarchal tropes are, well, just really painful, contrived, over-the-top tropes, and there's really nothing human about this film at all.Love at first sight clich√©? Check.Dead father meeting you at the gates of hell clich√©? Check.Tortured appropriate of Creation of Adam? Check.Spends less than 5 minutes mourning over the death of your father, then rides in a spaceship with the person responsible for it, with a smile on your face? CHECK.This film is a gigantic waste of time. A well deserved bomb at the box office.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","trinaboice","1 September 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
An alien scarab beetle chooses Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the recent college graduate with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle.The film was directed by Angel Manuel Soto, and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.THINGS I LIKED:
I first noticed Xolo Mariduena in the Netflix TV show Cobra Kai where he does a fantastic job. He's excellent in this role and has a very bright future. I'm so happy for him and for his success. His character features a scrappy, na√Øve element to the Superhero genre, much like Spider-Man has done for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Other cast members include Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon, comedian George Lopez, Harvey Guillen, Belissa Escobedo, Adriana Barraza, Damian Alcazar, Becky G, Elpidia Carillo, Bruna Marquezine, and Raoul Max Trujillo. They all do a great job by clearly defining distinct characters. The grandma character is awesome and hilarious.DC Studios CEO James Gunn ultimately decided that the Blue Beetle character would be disconnected from the DC Universe. That being said, we see the name ""Lexcorp"" on a tower from the Superman movies. We also see Jaime wearing a Gotham Law hoodie from the Batman movies.Final Fantasy video game fans will get a kick out of the scene when Jaime creates the Buster Sword as his weapon of choice.We're introduced to Mexican culture. The Latino population will love seeing one of their own featured as a superhero! One of the Hispanic characters dies, something that the DC studio pushed for in order to make it more emotional. Angel Manuel Soto didn't want to do that but later saw it as an opportunity to share how the Mexican culture views death.Family is at the heart of this movie. It's what gives the film both a soul and humor.Humor has been one of the magical elements to the success of Marvel movies and where DC movies have failed, for the most part. This movie taps into the natural humor of a Mexican family and gives it all of the charm DC needed to level up to Marvel.The town of Palmera City is fictitious, much like Gotham City.Fun fact #1: Roberto Gomez, son of the original Chapulin actor Roberto Gomez Bolanos voices a radio transmission in this movie.The film has a lot of entertaining Easter eggs to look for. For example, in Spanish, we hear someone announce on the TV that ""Bruce Wayne Bought Twitter."" Ha ha I remember seeing ""Sabado Gigante"" on TV when I sailed through the channels. In one scene in this movie, we see it playing on the TV in the background.This is the 14th movie in the DC Extended Universe.One element that I really loved was when the Blue Beetle is able to truly understand a bad guy's unique perspective. Hurt people hurt. If only we all took the time to understand, rather than judge and react without the full story.Keep watching during the rolling credits for another scene.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Because of Xolo Mariduena's work in Cobra Kai, we know that he has some serious karate skills, yet they were, sadly, underutilized in this movie. His physicality and skills could have been a real highlight. He's not much of a superhero throughout most of the movie, but just bumbles his way through fights and, most of the time, gets beat up or tries to run away.So much CGI.So much screaming.The villain isn't very compelling.It's extremely cliched with wooden dialogue.Very predictable.Sometimes, the Blue Beetle suit's robot capabilities work but other times it's silent and doesn't seem to help. I didn't understand the inconsistencies.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
A lot of Spanish is spoken with subtitles.There is a surprising amount of profanity in English and Spanish.Superhero fighting
Lots of destruction
Talk of a parent who died in the past
Someone in the family dies a sad, unexpected death.Some blood splatters.We see a flashback of a child kidnapping.Bug farts.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","postmeiska","4 January 2024","So this is what the new leadership of everything 'Warner Brothers' thinks the DC Universe should be about? The king of reality TV sure knows his audience. This stereotyped, dumbed down, regurgitated storyline is as predictable as sunrise and sunset. There are tons of reviews that accurately point out the issues with this mess of a movie. The problem is that there are about 60% of people that think this movie is perfectly fine. These are people who do not want to be challenged by a decent plot or care about anything more than blowing things up. Unfortunately more and more content is being created to satisfy their tastes. It's simply cheaper to produce. The appetite for mindless television and movies is at an all time high.","3/10"

But Blue Beetle is just straight up boring. There is zero character development, no purpose to the characters and the MC's family just won't shut up.The movie puts a lot of emphasis on family and love, which is all dandy, but it really doesn't work when the family is just outright annoying.Plot wise it's just as disappointing. Sure it's a superhero movie, but did the writers really believe that the audience would buy the fact that a loser uncle in the family just so happens to be able to operate a high tech flying aircraft just because? There are too many plot holes that are too illogical to ignore and I do no recommend you find out.Overall an extremely disappointing end to the current DC UNIVERSE.

But i have to say at least it was something different.Wow what do they have to offer, the next Superman movie better be all out.Blue Beetle had a great chance to become good but was limited by the writers imagination and creativity.Which is become a DC flaw lately.

It's one big, contrived, snooze fest as it rehashes the same old, boring, teenage comic book super hero origin story.Jaime's story arc mainly consists of him being lectured by his family members. Susan Sarandon phones in her performance as the villain, and the story as a whole lacks any depth or character development. CGI/VFX look fine, but the action sequences are very uninspired.

"Blue Beetle","baileygianninimoviebuff","26 November 2023","Blue Beetle is a superhero movie that only works for audiences who are kids and teenagers. Older audiences who grew up with the older superhero movies that were made in the early 2000s won't like this one. This film contains a cast that has awful acting, and the idea isn't original at all. What they did was take a number of superheroes and they blended them together. Spiderman, Ironman, DeadPool and Batman are the main superheroes that the filmmakers blended together to create Blue Beetle. DC is struggling to create new original supheroes. The superhero genre isn't doing as bad as other genres are doing, like the horror genre, but for creating brand new superheros the idea needs to be original and the superhero shouldn't be so identical to other superheroes that superhero fans can see that they're replicating and copying ideas that have already been done. Even George Lopez's acting wasn't the best at all. George Lopez has done a lot of amazing movies and tv shows. I certainly hope he doesn't return for a sequel if one ever gets made. The whole movie fell apart very quickly and I didn't enjoy Blue Beetle one bit. It was lousy and it's a complete rip off of the superheroes that I had mentioned above. This is just a movie that is better off without a sequel. I am not giving this movie a bad rating based off of any political stuff, I just wanted to get that out of the way. I'm giving Blue Beetle a bad rating because it's unoriginal and it lacks complete creativity. Blue Beetle ranks at the top of my list for the worst Superhero movie ever made, period. Blue Beetle is extremely disappointing in every single way. I watched it because a friend recommended it to me. I don't know what other superhero fans saw, but what I saw was a desperate attempt to rake in money from the superhero fans. It didn't do that well at the box office and it definitely shows. The trailer made the movie look better than what the real movie actually is. To me the trailer looked okay, but the real movie is just pure trash and this is what I call an attention seeking film.Rating: 1/2 star out of 5.","1/10"

"Blue Beetle","ghopper-35896","21 November 2023","This is probably the worst DC movie in all of its history. Started out OK for let's say the first 10 or 15 minutes after which I should've probably shot myself in the face instead of watching this freaking movie. It was just a bunch of Spanish stereotypes, and nothing else. The story was horrible, the action horrible, the character development was horrible, everything in this movie was horrible. I do not know why DC cannot seem to tell a decent story unless it's the Joker or Batman. This may have been worse than Shazam, but they're both pretty close. I would not waste your time or effort in watching any part of this movie.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","gehete-40949","31 October 2023","One of the many grave sins of hollywood is the marginalization of class struggle. The bud of the joke are most of the time the favorite opressed individuals, immigrants, different religious backgrounds, niche artisans with low income etc. Dc like Disney or Marvel, with executives that are as close to working class struggle as the sun is to the moon love to think of themselves as educators and illuminators when forcing such narratives down the writers and directors throats. So we as the consumer are supposed to get inspired by the very unlikely success stories again shoved down our eyes. It is cheap, it is disingenous and always backwards in any human capacity. So this movie is not different in that sense only with the slight off premise of the social climber becoming a super hero. Stop mass producing backwards narratives please.","5/10"
"Blue Beetle","DJRayC","19 November 2023","I watched this even though I hate George Lopez. He is a one trick pony who's horseshoes have worn out. Whoever thought he should be in a movie again should get their head examined. This movie puts Latino's to shame. Maybe if George would not have been in it I might give it more stars. If you can't tell..I hate George Lopez...oh did I say that already... Can't say it enough. I don't think the DCU will ever catch up to Marvel, especially with crap like this. To quote a popular line from another movie ""At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.""","6/10"

"Blue Beetle","silvius84","23 August 2023","Definitely see this in theaters! Xolo IS the Blue Beetle!Greatly enjoyed this movie. It had so much heart. It had family love. It had the action. Ok, some parts were corny.... But it didn't bother me. I love a FUN superhero movie. But this has heart. I cried, a few times. Some of sorrow some of joy. But in the end, I laughs and smiled.I thought it was well made and a fun film. Xolo does a great job in the titular role, I was worried because his character in Cobra Kai is kinda whiney, a little annoying; but not Jaime (his character in Blue Beetle) as he is older and I'd say more mature than his CK character. I definitely suggest seeing this in theatres!!!","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","dorMancyx","21 August 2023","A very traditional origin movie, in other words nothing original -- it's basically a big pot stew of the Shazam family, uncle Ben, Shuri, and Fast&Furious. The entire exposition is filled with scripted dialogues, stiff performances, and cliche development, to the point where the film kinda invites you to nap the first 30 minutes. However, I do appreciate Blue Beetle for respecting the 2 crucial components of any superhero movie: suit up and first flight, as both segments are visibly budgeted. Another thing worthy of compliment are the action sequences, which are well-choreographed, of considerable lengths, although all heavily CGIed. Everything else, including but not limiting to romance, backstories, comedy, antagonists, are just plainly average. Better luck next year DC, hopefully James Gunn will get things back on track soon.","4/10"
"Blue Beetle","jp_91","23 August 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is a typical superhero movie but better than many others, this time with a script based on Jaime Reyes, a Mexican superhero. The performances are good, highlighting Elpidia Carrillo, Adriana Barraza and Susan Sarandon, the latter as a villain. The cinematography is well done, the music composed for the film goes unnoticed and the special effects manage to be good in some scenes while failing to look real in others. The songs used were not really well chosen, there were only two really good Mexican songs, the rest are based on the stereotype of rural Mexico. An entertaining superhero movie without being a masterpiece.","3/10"
"Blue Beetle","isaacsundaralingam","24 August 2023","There's nothing about Blue Beetle that makes it stand out in any positive way against the numerous other superhero movies around. It's like a movie made to be forgotten. Literally everything about Blue Beetle feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to make a superhero movie based on every other superhero movie ever made.And what on earth is this new trend of creating unbearably annoying over the top characters we're supposed to be rooting for? It's supposed to be endearing to watch a bunch of people act like they're all developmentally disabled because... family? Especially the main character's sister; who ends up being a patience tester in how annoying she was throughout, and the worst part about it is knowing that it's not actually supposed to annoy us, but to make us empathize with what a cool sister she is. Like, no, please, stop. There wasn't a single likeable character in that entire family (except maybe the dad, who at best was just around)... the sister, the mom, the uncle and the grandma... Oh man, the grandma. I would hate life if that was my family.Even with all that, it would be a little unfair to call it a bad movie. It's somewhere between below-average to average depending on how annoyed I am I guess. And no, there's nothing new here for you to have to check out, but if you still feel like you want to, you're not going to be disappointed either.","7/10"
"Blue Beetle","olcare","27 August 2023","This year's new installment of the increasingly numerous average superhero movies was this one. There's nothing original; the character's origin is once again poorly and haphazardly narrated with childish jokes, and in many aspects, it's quite mediocre.I won't go into detail about missing this scene or that scene. Overall, the movie is just flat; a few scenes can bring a smile, and one scene was purely emotional, but other than that, I felt like I was watching a movie I've seen every year.Speaking about the characters in general, if I come to Carapax, his origin is enjoyable, but in trying to adapt the villain to the present day, they've turned the character into an ordinary one that has lost its appeal. Nana Reyes is the worst character in the movie; I've never seen such a forced character that's not funny at all. They've written absurd scenes, claiming she's a grandmother who can do everything; I couldn't make any sense of it. Xolo Mariduena fits the role, in my opinion, but no one around him shines in the film.I found DCU's initial character introduction to be mediocre as well. The quality of this film is truly mediocre; while watching, I felt like they were treating us a bit foolishly. The fact that the government doesn't get involved in any events, and the police or any higher authority doesn't intervene, made me feel incredibly foolish. Yes, maybe Kord could be a big corporation in the film, but it wasn't realistic at all.These companies really need a more realistic scenario and a visionary perspective. At the same time, they need directors who genuinely read the comics, understand the characters, and have knowledge of them...Addition: After seeing its budget, I felt like a fool; approving such a mediocre project for this much money is truly questionable for the future of the studio, in my opinion.","6/10"
"Blue Beetle","Chris_L","22 September 2023","So many superhero movies have been made over the last couple of years that it gets harder and harder to find something new, something fresh - or even something close to the better movies of this genre of the last 15 years.Blue Beetle does not impress in that regard but it is just another forgetable albeit nice enough movie. It could have been more but apart from the fact that the story is simply too predictable they decided to try to be funny but often fail, portrayed the family in a very stereotypical and over the top way and often in these situations it is a bit cringeworthy.The movie is likeable as are its heroes and we made it through but it is unlikely I would watch it again.","3/10"

"Blue Beetle","ttalje","27 August 2023","To summarize the movie in one sentence: an action movie with a linear cliche story line, mediocre acting, below average CGI and made mostly to appeal to younger teenage audiences.Now, if you go in expecting the above then the movie rating would be 6 and if you are going in expecting a super hero movie in the likes of Marvel then you will rate this 1.What annoyed me the most is the exaggerated fiction and story line. This felt at a lot of times like watching cartoons where just drawing the scene makes it possible to do in real.Another annoying factor is most of the movie is in Spanish so it requires extra effort to follow through with the dialogue.Here is the rating of:Storyline: 2/5. Very cliche, linear and expected outcome. Moreover, the editing should have been done better as you notice there are many gaps between the scenes in the movie.CGI: 2/5. You would expect really good CGI in an action super hero movie but this isn't the case here. That's not coming as a surprise from DC comics and they could learn a thing or two from Marvel. Even when special effects were used on the helmet of ""blue beetle"" when it was half broken in the fighting scene, the helmet looked so cheap just like a toy for kids and reminded me of the old kids shows we used to see in the 90s on tv.Acting: 3/5. The reason why I put 3 is due to the good acting of the supporting cast mainly George Lopez and Adriana Barazza. The main actor Xolo delivers an underwhelming performance and lacks the ability to connect with the audience. My biggest disappointment was the horrible writing made for the lovely and amazing legendary actress Susan Sarandon, she deserves roles that are much better than this and movies on a different league. I hope she doesn't take such similar roles in the future.","3/10"
"Blue Beetle","deepakdst","27 August 2023","I don't quite follow the thinking of makers nowadays. What do yo really wanna achieve?? Do they only aim to make money?? Maybe then these movies do make sense cause I don't find anything new or rememberable in them.If you really wanna earn respect and attention then you absolutely need a lot more than just an ordinary family friendly good for nothing story. A guy somehow accidentally get superpowers and for next 2 hours same lame family drama, jokes and totally useless character development. And then what? Is there anything that I should remember? Is there anything that I should connect with?I think they really need to try something new and unique cause standalone movie are good for nothing if they are not impactful and remarkable.Otherwise try to focus on interconnected movies, that would be much better unless you just only want to make money and nothing else.","5/10"

So predictable and cringey, very dull movie, I feel sorry for Susan Sarandon. Trying to copy Marvel by merging Iron Man, Spider-man, War Machine etc. And by copying end credits scenes. I mean cmon, if you're not striving to be original, why do you do it? The story was dull, too inclusive (another outsider getting its powers from an alien source and is now a superhero who at first harms others and himself. The script was lousy, with lousy dad jokes and forced comedy. Leave the superhero filmmaking to the pros at Marvel.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","martimusross","30 September 2023","Blue BeetleThis was a great action movie, the whole thing rested on Xolo Maridue√±a, who played Jaime Reyes, he was so endearing, charming and charismatic that you couldn't help but cheer for our accidental hero. He really has got an incredible natural acting talent and would be perfect as a detective hunting down serial killers in Manhattan.The movie rested too heavily on caricatures of Mexicans, the Rey family were economic migrants to Texas, some legal some not, constantly griping about the haves and the have nots, however, it was clear, like so many they were starting again from the very bottom and very fact that Jamie had a degree in law shows the possibilities for social mobility in America.The whole cast was great but all the evil people were all ""white and entitled"", seemingly having to prove there were and good intentions, this was so obviously a political statement that I felt insulted, and maybe a little alienated and offended.I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10 for a great origin story.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","yankeemarlon","20 August 2023","Definitely feels recycled at certain parts and the plot is very predictable. Susan Sarandon doesn't work as the main villain for me, and there are some cringy moments (specifically with the Grandmother). However, it is a fun time with great action, decent humor, and a lot of heart. The visual effects look good for the most part, Xolo's performance is a highlight, and the Latino representation is a breath of fresh air. I consider this a W for DC given their recent movies.Overall, it won't show you anything you haven't seen before, but it's an enjoyable film and worth your time if you're into these types of movies.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","moviemanmo973","26 August 2023","This is a very generic superhero movie. The plot is so basic, predictable and audiences have seen this story many times before. None of the characters stand out. The acting wasn't very convincing from a majority of the cast. The dialogue is poorly written. The chemistry between the main character and the love interest isn't fully developed and is very rushed. The humor in the movie feels forced many times. Personally I didn't care for the family dynamic in this film although it was a major part of the story.Blue Beetle is well designed and has a cool looking costume. His powers are interesting and the special affects were good. The fights were just okay. So much more could have been done with this film and this character.","1/10"
"Blue Beetle","vanvance","22 September 2023","It's 2023, and the superhero movie is no longer new or a rare novelty. In truth, there have been so many over the last decade plus, that the typical formulas have all been seen dozens of times.For fans of the source material, this version of the Blue Beetle is particularly galling. Rather than the 1939 original (yes, that old), or the better known and written second version, Ted Kord (who does at least get some references in the film), we get a third, dull-as-dishwater incarnation, Jaimie Reyes.Jamie is young, well-meaning, and as bland as possible, but he is also American Mexican, and THAT is the theme and focus of the movie. Being Mexican, while being in a kick-ass Mexican family, and referencing Mexican pop culture (songs and TV shows).For those who believe a movie should focus on race above all else, Blue Beetle is a triumph. Alas, dissenting viewers ares likely to be bored, and grow disinterested as this limp film hits you with cliche then CGI, then more cliche, then more CGI etc... for 2+ hours.Blue Beetle isn't true to it's source material, and manages to be predictable above all else. It's truly a wasted opportunity.","9/10"

If you have two hours of your life that you do not have any other means of filling it with, this movie will do just that and that alone.It felt like they just took bits and pieces from Batman, Superman, Ironman, Spiderman, StreetFighter, The Matrix and any other movie/idea and tried combining into one!No story really, horrible CGI, mediocre acting, granny on a Gatlin gun, uncle that apparently is a mad genius and of course the Ole PC comes in every chance it can.Hollywood needs to remember that sometimes less is more. I love to watch movies to escape every day life but dang, that's getting really hard now a days.The one and only good thing that I think come from the movie is the importance of family.So I recommend a good movie from the 1980's- the early 2000's for entertainment!","2/10"

At no point does the movie manage to grab you/excite you with its drama or action scenes, and that's a pretty big flaw. I don't usually like superhero movies and this one could have been the exception, but DC failed to deliver.What is worthwhile is the soundtrack, and the idea of the superhero was very good, a pity that it was wasted in this way.","1/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","neil-476","30 March 2023","The Table, the international crminal brotherhood which has condemned John Wick empowers The Marquis to deal with him (and the Manager of the New York Continentale Hotel). But maybe, just maybe, there is a way out.As expected, the IMDB is full of people saluting this as ""Best John Wick yet,"" ""A masterpiece,"" ""Best action movie ever,"" etc. My view differs. But I must start by giving credit where it is due. Production design, cinematography, action choreography and direction are all first rate, and they deserved a much better film that this is. And this film deserved a much better script than this.The story is fine, quite good even, but it is buried under industrial quantities of action which defies belief. Everbody's resistance to trauma and the complete absence of police are just the big two, but let's not forget the endless succession of pairs of heavies coming out of nowhere and only stopping when Wick has no gun.And even the scriot deserved a better actor than Keanu Reeves. To be fair, the character in the first film has been reduced to a mere cardboard cutout here, but Reeves (who I genuinely like as a performer) doesn't even play cardboard well here.This is beautifully crafted drivel. 7 for craft, 3 for Reeves' central performance, averages to 5.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","siderite","23 May 2023","Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","BA_Harrison","25 March 2023","The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacr√©-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea).","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","namob-43673","23 May 2023","These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.","3/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","fciocca","24 March 2023","I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","4/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","24 March 2023","In this fourth installment of 8711's successful franchise, Keanu Reeves wearily drags himself from setpiece to setpiece, saying little, surviving the most ridiculous setups and finally achieves nothing.The acting and writing of JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 are indeed the worst aspects of this film, and the exaggerated runtime of almost three hours doesn't help.Try to remember John Wick's motivation to do all the things he does. What exactly is he actually doing, escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation, Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier, thus making at least the last two installments redundant.There's plenty of action here, sure, but it has been getting more and more unrealistic, and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye, especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting, yes, even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character, just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear, but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people, and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves, this is your jam.

The photography is beautiful and they have a dog as a hero. The rest is worthless. Save the money and the time.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","MovieIQTest","29 March 2023","From the very beginning to the end, nothing but endless kills, fighting, close combats, bloods squirts or splashes, KR after four chapters, he looked older, slower and tiresome. The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring, katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games.When John Wick fought for his life in the Japanese hotel against so many clueless foes and the Zatoishi-like blind swordsman played by Donny Yen with a Botox injected face, we all decided to quit at the same time.Hey, it's time to wrap it up, guys, no sense to continue to Chapter 5!","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","lovemichaeljordan","22 March 2023","Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","FeastMode","24 March 2023","Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.(5 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 3/23/2023, UltraScreen 3/28/2023, SuperScreen 4/10/2023, re-issue IMAX 5/2/2023, 9/22/2023)","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","markvanwasbeek","23 March 2023","By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","kskmah","26 April 2023","Who needs a 2hr and 40 min action movie? No one. Yes the action was good, but repeats so many times that it becomes so boring. How can hundreds of assassins not kill one man? Answer, not possible, only in this movie and series. How many times could the dog man have killed Wick? Many. So no other assassin could? Why would the table head get Caine to kill Wick when he knows he won't. You can challenge the head to a duel as a rule, but they only assigned a head for the first time ever in this movie? WTF? And then the head can select a replacement? And he selects a blind man. All Wick had to do was to stand on the side or drop down and he wouldn't get shot. I think everyone knew Wick didn't shoot in the last round, except for the stupid head bad guy. This is not an action movie, it's a fantasy.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","tresm87","16 March 2023","Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","rupali-38827","5 April 2023","No idea how the ratings are as high as they are. If you thought the first one was enjoyable but the 3rd one was bull, read on.Just as the body count in the 3rd was ridiculous, this is even more absurd. Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits, raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny. He's the best hitman on the world, how do we kill him? I know, we'll send a blind man!! Pathetic. And he can dodge bullets and he knows where everyone is. You could say it looked choreographed.Now, about the DJ! They may have well cut the scenes directly from the Warriors. Better film, done better and that isn't a great film. For those of you who have never heard of the Warriors, go watch it. For those of you that have, skip this nonsense.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","cadillac20","17 March 2023","Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","vengeance20","25 March 2023","Ok, so I got back from seeing this entry yesterday night. I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think ""dafuq!?""The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes
John Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes
John Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes
John Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutesNotice how the films got long & long with each entry...!Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing & overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare & when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long & annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad & anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I've lost hope in this franchise! Let's hope John Wick 5 (if ever) redeems this kak entry!4/10 & that's generous considering!","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","tkdlifemagazine","17 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsg√•rd. Skarsg√•rd makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close
Hiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited, having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Phil_H","3 June 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 is almost three hours of Keanu Reeves engaged in a gunfight, bookended with meaningless dialog-in-place-of-plot, and a lot of people being thrown down stairs. Of all the ""Wick"" movies, this is clearly the weakest one yet. Was anything added to the overall Wick-universe narrative? No. Did we see a whole lot of inconsequential people die? Yes. Did Keanu Reeves say ""yeah"" a lot? Yes.Look, I was hoping for SO much more than this. A meaningful ending to the series (which it isn't, because apparently this made so much money they are working on a fifth film), but what we got here was something in very much need of more script doctoring and less ""bang-bang.""With a little more work, this could have been an average movie. Don't talk to me about stunts or cinematography or the choreography of the actors in-play, wow me with a plot that makes sense and moves the story forward--John Wick 4 does not move the story forward. It just says ""let's shoot a bunch of people, okay?"" And that's what it does... for 3 hours.In the end I was of the following opinion once the credits rolled: ...and?...We all deserved better than this. John Wick did, too.","1/10"

Even liked the third one even though the ending blew baby chunks. All the 10s and 9s scores are so damn fake it's hilarious. IMDB is a joke. Someone needs to start a real movie database and weed out the fake high scores, it's as ridiculous as John Wick 4. He walks away from every major injury or collision or building fall. Then he passes away from flesh wounds. What nonsense. The whole plot is nonsense. The fights scene are so boring. I got up to make a sandwich twice. Just the typical 100 judo throws and same shots to head. Numerous coup de grace's. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this nonsense.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","jtindahouse","23 March 2023","In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released, the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsg√•rd. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.This film was a blast from start to finish. 9/10.","1/10"

Fight, fight fight, bite, bite, bite, it's John Wick, the silliest action movie franchise in history...and it runs 2h49m so there's a lot of extra fighting and biting.Serial killer John Wick is at it again, folks. They should have a graphic in the top right corner of the screen counting how many people he kills in every movie. If watching this doesn't make your brain hurt, you may need to get yours fixed.Everyone talks about the well-choreographed fight scenes, but they have zero link with reality that there can be no tension felt by viewers. Of course, John Wick will walk away from his battles, no matter how stupidly absurd the odds.There can be zero tension in an action movie when there is this much carnage going on. If the hero always comes through, no matter how daunting the odds are against him, why bother watching? Just fast-forward to the end, or stand up and walk out of the theater.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","007Waffles","23 June 2023","The first John Wick was the best, after that they all went down hill. There's no point to these movies.John Wick 4 is three hours of mind-numbing repetition. Keanu reading the script: ""Punch, roll, headshot, repeat. Dude, I think I got it.""
I'm not even sure what John Wick was trying to accomplish. These movies could have gone on for 100 years and nothing would have changed.And evidently everyone is now bullet proof and has infinite ammo. John took out 250 guys with his 9mm pistol. He's also invincible. He can fall several stories and not even break a bone, get run over a dozen times, and roll down a million stairs.I would have enjoyed this movie more if at the end he took off flying because he was really Neo in a simulator and all of this took place in the Matrix, which would explain Laurence Fishburn.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","imseeg","24 March 2023","The bad: it lasts too long. A whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes. Some of the fighting scenes stretch out over 5 to 15 minutes of CONTINEOUS fighting. But after having watched over 2 hours of fighting already, I definitely began to long for it to end.The good: the fighting scenes are pretty good though. I was wondering if they could still come up with some new and interesting fighting choreography and they succeeded at that quite well. There are even quite a few comical fighting stunts included. Nice!All in all not a bad sequel. If it werent for the much TOO long duration I would rate this nr 4 sequel better / higher as the nr 3 edition.Nothing beats the original first edition of John Wick though, because THAT first edition was not only contineous action but also cared about the CHARACTERS. Unfortunately all the sequels were more and more focussed on solely the figthing scenes, which kinda bored me in the end.Nr 4 is highly overrated. I suspect because of artificial ""managing"" of the Imdb ratings. This movie is never worthy of 8 stars (ridiculous). 6 stars at best. But because I got bored at the end I will only rate it 5 stars...","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","furnacefuneral","23 March 2023","Indiana jones, terminator, predator, Jurassic park, the matrix, Jason bourne, etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point. This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER. And the shotgun fight in Paris with the ""dragons breath"" is the best action sequence I've probably ever seen in my life.","3/10"

But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like ""City Of Lost Children"" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from ""No Time To Die"" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists. All Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","minunimion","27 May 2023","I don't get why this movie has a high score, it doesn't deserve it. It's horrible, it doesn't make any sense, just killing people, but how can it be possible that those people after being shot many times, were able to fight as nothing happened to them? And the plot? Trying to kill John Wick in any way possible, period.The worst thing is that they used some scenes from the movie The Warriors (1979), they didn't try to change anything, a black woman with nice big lips, talking on the radio, guiding the gangs with the purpose to chase and kill The Warriors. Same with John Wick, but of course with a modern technology. Shame on you! Didn't you have any better idea? You just copied an old movie that was much better than this one, and that soundtrack was great!What a disappointment! It remembers somehow Kill Bill, but that movie was very good, this one is almost unacceptable!I enjoyed the other movies about John Wick, they were very well done, and had a good plot. This time it seems like they didn't know what to write.Not even the ending was good, is he really dead? We can't be sure, and probably there will be a John Wick 5, because something is missing. Anyway the fight against the thugs, before the last duel, was really bad... just a videogame.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","UniqueParticle","24 March 2023","May or may not count as a spoiler but John Wick pilled up more of a body count than Jason Vorhees sure different genre yet both great killing machines! Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers, the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise!

"John Wick: Chapter 4","radhrh","28 March 2023","Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Then there's the blatant plagerism of Walter Hill's, The Warriors which demonstrates just how little new the franchise has to offer. Time to call it a day.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","codytheway","27 March 2023","Listen, this movie was far from as good as the others and had very little realism to it compared to the others. Numerous times John falls from like 4 stories up and gets up and walks it off. He also gets hit by cars numerous times and simply just walks it off. He also falls down 222 steps and gets up and walks it off. Where is the realism here?Also, the acting was incredibly bad. Like really really bad. Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins? And lastly, why did John go through allllll of that crap just to die at the end? To protect Winston? The dude who shot him off roof?Overall, there was only a couple of good parts to the movie. Nothing that the other 3 movies hadn't done before.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","mklarsen-51895","22 March 2023","We all walk into John Wick 4 with expectations of what we will see, standards we refuse to lower and excitement already creeping in. From the first second it engages you, no hesitation, no quarter. And it's only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn't a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren't wrong. Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is ""lesser"" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :DI know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not, I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.Don't leave until after the credits are done. Trust me, it's not finished.","6/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","navendu_krishnan","26 March 2023","Unpopular Opinion - John Wick 4 is a below average movie.I loved all 3 John wick movies, but this one is more likely a conclusion of John wick series, So the fight scenes are boring and repetitive. Previous movies had different types of action and stunt choreographies. This one has long same fights , might be in different locations.As far Keanu goes, his close up shots or his face doesnt appear in the movie atleast for a half time. John wick past movies had few dialogues but it had an impact, 4 has same few dialogues but it was very plain and flat.Ending is Spoiler - John Wick Dies (or not) shown in a way that if there is a possibility of a sequel , there can be.May stunts shots and its accuracy is totally gone, we can clearly see that where the gun is aimed and it just went like a paper plane. Even with the so-called Coat Armour, some pistol shots were directly aimed at Head / Leg which was again repelled with the armor which is in the shoulder.The sad thing is this is the same with Balayya movies, but when it directed and taken in Hollywood people go crazy!An average movie 6/10.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Bibiliography","28 May 2023","This is laughably bad. My second hand embarrassment threw up its hands and died of shame.I adore Keanu but my god he failed at even the most basic fight choreography; although the fault is shared equally with the script writers, the editing team, and the director who all decided we needed almost 3 hours of whatever this was.If anyone believes that a half bent over John Wick could kill 100s of super trained assassins all by himself, then have I got a bridge to sell you in Laos.Look, KR is like a 100 yrs old and should have long retired from doing any film that requires hand-to-hand combat.Note to Keanu's agent: get this man into a zombie/apocalypse movie, ffs.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Tactrix","22 May 2023","So I like the John Wick series as much as the next guy but this is just lazy. There are a couple of things that we need to address here.First the story has gotten very VERY stale. Like to the point of where if you removed the story, it wouldn't have mattered, at all.Second as where in the first movie there was some pretty damn good choreography, in this installment I literally watched MULTIPLE scenes of guys standing around waiting for 1 guy to go down so they could pretend to jump in. And no, this wasn't like a behind the scenes take.And the final insult is the actual fighting itself, there are just times when for no reason the person he's fighting just sits there, they aren't knocked out, they aren't dead, they're just waiting for him to get his gun, load some bullets, go for a coffee, and then shoot them. It actually pains me to watch this garbage be pawned off as a top tier movie.This is when you guys should stop this series, lets be honest you should have stopped it at the last movie, but ok, you had to give it a proper ending. News flash, this isn't it.","9/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","johnyoungphotos","23 June 2023","This movie was just silly nonsense and reminded me of a bad video game. People were holding their suits up like they were batman to shield themselves from bullets a few feet away and the fight scenes seemed awkward and slow like they were practising them before the actual shoot. To be honest I only gave this.one star as I like. Keanu Reeves and enjoyed the other John Wick movies especially the first one.This is not a good movie and when John Wick was pushed off a ledge about 40 feet up and bounced off a concrete ledge before face planting a concrete floor and just got back up while all the time dancers around him paid no attention to what happened I knew it was time to turn it off.I have no idea where the good reviews come from but do yourself a favour and go watch something else.... anything else.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","untilnow99","25 June 2023","Does Bill Skarsg√•rd know how to wear a suit or does that man know how to wear a suit? I'm giving the costume designer for John Wick 4 a nice fat ""10"". But the rest of the movie?Everything bad that can be said about this movie has been said already, by other reviewers. Still, I can't resist adding a few gripes of my own. Forgive me for repeating what other's have already written, but I feel like it's the only way I can get rid of this very bad taste in my mouth.Keanu I love you with a passion, but you're too old and creaky to come off as someone who is impervious to cars slamming into you at 45mph. The scene where you fall 75+ feet onto a car and walk away like nothing happened? Hahahahaha. Stop it, you're killing me.And you, with your gray beard, rolling down 222 stone steps ----- ALL the way down the steps, and then AGAIN part way, even though there are multiple breaks in the stairs where (kudos to stunt work!) anyone else would have eventually come to a halt in their rolling? ---- pure comedy.The fight scenes where the guys WAIT for you to make your move, over and over and OVER again. Beyond painful to watch. The audience can practically see the cartoon balloon over your head reading, ""Okay. Now this is where I insert my left leg in between this dude's legs and I heave myself over, so we twist and, as he falls, he very helpfully throws himself to the side and then he waits for me to shoot him in the head.""The fight scene choreographers should all die of shame. Is this the best they could do? Time after time the bad guy pulls back and you can almost hear him saying to himself, ""Wait for it. This is where Keanu comes at me, jumps on my chest and then shoots and stabs me. Ready set go!""Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Lance Riddick, Ian McShane, Larry Fishburne = Great performances. Keanu? Some of the worst of the worst of your acting effort, sad to say. Really BAD.One last thing: Ian McShane's upper teeth really bothered me. As in mesmerized by their fakeness and fit type bother me. Can't unsee that.Of course Baba Yaga isn't dead. Pfft. But I sure hope this franchise is. Enough is enough.","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","17 March 2023","That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.","2/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Zeus-pro","17 March 2023","John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Andrew_Wiper","24 March 2023","Quite possibly the best action movie of the decade. It's only 2023. This one is currently number one.

Keanu is a bad ass ok. He moves a little slow in the beginning but by the time the second half comes along he moves like a martial arts madman. That being said.. the nunchucks he incorporates into his character in that first half is brilliant. The set pieces in this are absolutely fantastic. The music is perfectly incorporated as well. There were a few nods to some classic flicks too. Movie buffs will catch them.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Holt344","26 March 2023","My expectations for John Wick: Chapter 4 was high, these films have become some of my favorite action films of all time, and I can say this without giving it a second thought how it met those expectations. The thugs and easy obstacles are nothing new, except for how they too have ballistic suits like our protagonist. But this Chapter begins with a recovered Baba Yaga who's out for blood. Actors and returning characters along with Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Ian McShane as Winston Scott, and Lance Reddick (in one of his final roles) as Charon. New roles which I loved was Donnie Yen as Caine: a blind High Table assassin and an old friend of John Wick.Bill Skarsg√•rd as the Marquis Vincent de Gramont: a powerful member of the High Table whose position is challenged by John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most, I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that. Brilliant choreography for each character, good guys like bad guys. With Hiroyuki Sanada being as brilliant as ever! Also showing off Donnie Yen's retired blind assassin. It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special, you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris, it has the biggest importance to the story, it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsg√•rd holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though, maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else, and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie, both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter, it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take, except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above, letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades, his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film, small like big, all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, I don't have any problem with it, it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood, it's about what happens on the screen, blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length, Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long, full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story, only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim, yes, but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was, but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends, to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point, Chad uses the film's length for just that, to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!This might be the best film of the four, both action and drama, also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft, making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it, when I saw it at the cinema, a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside, John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix, John ""Baba Yaga"" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for. This was an incredible film, one of the best I've seen in awhile.","1/10"

There's no real story line, just fight scenes after fight scenes. The suits are like the protective shields from Dune. Each fight scene is boring as there's no real investment in the characters.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","movie-reviews-uk","26 March 2023","Let's be honest if, by now, you choose to see a ""John Wick"" movie then you know what's coming. Several hours of hyperkinetic, over the top violence with a pounding soundtrack and moody lighting. On this front ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" delivers and then some.There isn't a plot that I can recall but once again our favourite assassin is wrestling with the unseen High Table and the price on his head is increasing faster than post-Covid inflation. So every goon in a suit is out to collect and John has to wade through a tsunami of bodies in order to, well, keep killing people.Clearly there's no logic here as John has no identifiable motive anymore or even an end-goal in mind. Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets shot in the head at close range.So is it a great film? Well yes because ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" plays it straight down the line and sticks religiously to its aesthetic. There are no in-jokes here, in fact there are more grunts than dialog, and the film absolutely believes in itself. On that front it's a right belter.","1/10"

I normally like action movies, and don't mind the hole plots, the exaggerations ++ as long as you get involved with the characters and it's funny. This had little humor, and it was so over exaggerated the the point I just wanted everyone to die (even John, and he should have died 1,5 hours earlier). I was so mad when he fell down the stairs for the 20th time, I just wanted the movie to end.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","willz187","28 March 2023","I really liked the first 3. And really hated this one. I thought the action sequences were stupid like one that reminded me of the scene in Hot Rod where Andy Samberg goes flying down and a hill and doesn't stop for miles. Apparently this is one of John Wick's new superpowers, to be able to survive long falls. The Scout character is extra stupid and unnecessary. I don't understand his motivation. There's too many characters here that are supposed to be important. I just found everything confusing and redundant. There may have been one or two scenes that I liked but I can't even think which they are. Keannu is too slow now to pull these fight scenes off. Donnie reprises his role from Star Wars Rogue One. I just think it's a messy movie.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","thom59","26 May 2023","There are many deaths in this filmic free-for-all. And assassins. Donnie Yen plays a blind martial arts expert, a role he knows all too well since he played an identical character in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. And that really sets up the debate around whether plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, or just a dumb, lazy rip off. There are references aplenty from the sci-fi/kung fu genres, including some of Keanu's own efforts. He knows kung fu-and shows us. It's kung fu'd up the wazoo. I imagine the director, a stunt man himself, simply Scotch taped together one fight scene after the next. FOR THREE HOURS! Three writers are credited with crafting 380 words of dialogue for Mr. Reeves. Okay, I read that Stahelski and Reeves stripped out roughly half the dialogue written for his character in the initial script. Accordingly, I would have stripped the writers of their entire salary. The first instalment featuring this legendary hit-man was just that, a smash hit. However, much like the Matrix sequels John Wick: Chapter 4 just gets on my wick.Incidentally, the movie tagline is Baba Yaga. More appropriate would be jibber-jabber.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","quickdraw88","26 May 2023","A dramatic step down in quality from previous entries in the series.The main drawcard being the action sequences and gunplay. Sadly in chapter 4 they lack any stakes and become boring and repetitive almost instantly. Bullets have no effect or simply pass through people, stuntmen routinely stumble while waiting for their queue to attck then die, basics like taking cover take a back seat to flashy unnecessary spin that some one thought ""looked cool"". Many sequences just look like a bad dress rehearsal they decided to keep.Unnecessary characters that add nothing to the already non existent plot. Streets or famous landmarks are completely empty or filled with bystanders that appear to be in a different dimension, oblivious to the insane acts of violence occurring next to them until it suits the plot or they vanish into thin air from one shot to the next. Not a single police car or officer called out the entire movie. In possibly the most unrealistic scene, an entire subway train in Osaka is empty. This is a movie that holds the same level of quality and planning you'd expect from a bunch of 7 year old boys playing bang bang in their back yard. ""My suit is bullet proof"" you hear them yell as you chuckle and sigh, ""ah kids.."" You really really need to switch off your brain to enjoy this 3hr slog, or just laugh at how poorly planned and executed the entire idea is.I can understand people wanted this to be good and rated it highly because these types of movies are indeed in short supply these days and I also want to see more quality adult action movies made. But lets be honest, even with a high budget this is just plain old fashioned below average shlock. ""Wrap it up"" someone said, too bad there's no bow on this one.","3/10"

Title: ""John Wick 4: Explosive Action with a Repetitive Plot""Word Count: 709""John Wick 4"" is the highly anticipated sequel to the action-packed franchise that has captivated audiences with its adrenaline-fueled sequences. While the film delivers on its promise of spectacular action scenes, it falls short in terms of originality and narrative depth. Despite its flaws, ""John Wick 4"" manages to entertain fans of the series, but fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors.Undeniably, the movie showcases some truly impressive action sequences. From intense gunfights to jaw-dropping stunts, the film's choreography and execution are impeccable. The fight scenes are meticulously crafted, and Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication to his role as the lethal assassin John Wick. The combination of Reeves' physicality and the expertly designed action sequences creates a thrilling cinematic experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.However, the film's biggest flaw lies in its repetitiveness. While the previous installments of the franchise offered a fresh take on the action genre, ""John Wick 4"" feels like a rehash of familiar territory. The plot fails to bring anything new to the table, resulting in a sense of predictability that diminishes the overall impact of the film. The narrative lacks the complexity and depth that fans have come to expect from the series, leaving much to be desired.One of the disappointments of ""John Wick 4"" is the lack of a compelling story. The film relies heavily on the established formula of John Wick facing insurmountable odds and battling countless adversaries. The absence of a coherent and engaging plot prevents the movie from reaching its full potential. While the franchise has never been known for its intricate storytelling, this installment takes it to a new level by prioritizing action over substance.Another aspect that hampers the film's impact is the portrayal of the High Table. In previous movies, the enigmatic organization added an element of intrigue and mystery to the narrative. However, in ""John Wick 4,"" the High Table becomes a monotonous antagonist whose only purpose seems to be providing John Wick with repeated chances for redemption. This narrative choice not only diminishes the stakes but also makes the world feel less grounded and realistic.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","hjvergara","24 March 2023","""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is one of the most captivating, exciting, eye-popping, hyperkinetic, and beautiful action films ever made. Director Chad Stahelski has done the unthinkable; he has outdone himself in this fourth entry by taking a two hour and forty-nine-minute runtime (the longest in the series) and making it feel an hour shorter. This is a combat magnum opus, a relentless sensory experience, gorgeously hyperviolent, and easily the best in the series.Baba Yaga is, once again, fighting to defeat the High Table while also facing a devilish and powerful new adversary (a disquieting and deviously memorable performance by Bill Skarsg√§rd as Marquis) in death-defying, blood-spurting, neon-blasting, stunts-to-spare, well-groomed, high-fashion style. Yes, the plot is rather simple, straightforward, and lacking in in-depth character background, but that hasn't been the strength of any of the Wick films anyway.The masterful elements at play in ""Chapter 4"" begin with its colorful, even extravagant, and likeable supporting characters including Laurence Fishburne as the crafty Bowery, Clancy Brown as the cryptic Harbinger, Donnie Yen - electrifying as the blind, yet intuitive Caine - and most terrifically, Shamier Anderson as Tracker - a shady spy-like character that gives an indelible performance that ranges from brutal toughness to vulnerable subjugation.Add heart-pounding sound effects and a pulsating musical score, striking nighttime, dark and gritty noir-inspired cinematography, and masterful fighting choreography that frames Wick in different cities with sumptuous vistas across the globe (the locales are outstanding from Sacr√© Coeur, to Arc de Triomphe, to the Louvre, to the Eiffel Tower in France to the opening scene in Aqaba, Jordan plus Berlin and Tokyo) and you end up with what feels like the most edgy, revolutionary, and most James Bond-esque entry yet.The elaborate and visceral set designs are ""Chapter 4's"" crowning achievement; lavish and rich with detail, they put Wick in elegant and high-tech rooms, ornate buildings, rousing nightclubs, and most memorably, a long flight of stairs and heavily trafficked streets where gut-wrenching, head-popping fighting sequences ensue. It's a WICKedly wild ride from beginning to end that left me breathless, gasping, and exclaiming ""wow!"" in wonderment.","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","TristanSilya","17 April 2023","I can see why people love it and I can see why people hate it. People want different things out of a movie and John Wick 4 delivers exceptionally well in certain areas while being mediocre in others.A quick summary is I had a fking great time watching it at some points and a little bored during others. The action scenes are fantastic. It's a TON of fun and really cool to watch. A little towards the middle of the film it did feel a bit slow and dragged out. Cutting out 15 mins would be perfect.Held up by good action and decent laughs is the weak story. I absolutely LOVE the idea of the underground black market, the continentals, and the high table. I wish we got to see more of that world. I wanted more backstory, more exposure, more display of how they ran behind the scenes. Hopefully I'll get to see that in the Ballerina and Continental.The other thing I think hindered the movie was that the idea of the high table got watered down. They started off as some serious group that mean business that you don't want to mess with. In John Wick 4 I felt like they were kind of a joke and not really as big as mean as people made them out to be. John Wick was just so broken in the 4th chapter. I know it's the whole appeal of John Wick but it does take away from the story and suspense when, even with suspension of disbelief, is just pure absolute absurdity. But that's also why I love it!I swear John Wick can take more hits than some Avengers. He's like a tank with the body of Wolverine.But regardless of what you're looking for you have to give it to the crew for how much work and dedication they put in to this movie. The quality really shows here. It's just really fun and exciting to watch. I rate it higher than the other John Wick films even though it's not my favorite just because in 9 out of 10 ways it's bigger and better.But I love the other John Wick films because we got more backstory, more Continental, and more focus on story.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","nederlandhiker-22571","25 May 2023","By far the worst of the four unless you are a brainless action junkie looking for a fix.It didn't take much writing for this one, everyone wants to kill John and John kills everyone, the end.The first three chapters at least had a break where a storyline appeared and there was some dialogue between the actors that added to the story in between fight scenes. The fourth one seemed to be no more than a poorly written attempt at cashing in on the first three. Profit seemed to be the motivating factor.?On the upside, the action scenes were good, though like drinking, it may have been better served if done in moderation, with a little time left over for a story.","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","FilmFanatic2023","19 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 is the latest installment in the popular action franchise starring Keanu Reeves as the titular assassin. Directed by Chad Stahelski, who helmed all the previous films, this sequel continues the story of John Wick's quest for freedom from The High Table, a mysterious organization that rules over the underworld. Along the way, he faces new enemies and allies, as well as old friends and foes.The movie is a feast for action fans, as it showcases some of the most impressive and inventive fight scenes ever put on screen. From gunfights to knife fights, from car chases to horse chases, from Paris to Tokyo, John Wick: Chapter 4 never lets up on the adrenaline and excitement. Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication and skill as an action star, performing most of his own stunts and delivering his trademark deadpan humor.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg√•rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.The movie is not without its flaws, however. At nearly three hours long, it feels bloated and overstuffed at times. Some scenes drag on for too long or feel unnecessary. Some plot points are confusing or underdeveloped. Some characters are underused or wasted. The movie also relies heavily on fan service and references to previous films, which may alienate newcomers or casual viewers.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","saru2020","25 June 2023","If I've understood correctly, this film doesn't really have any plot at all at least for those who're familiar with the john wick world.This film relies heavily on the actions and nothing else, just action.We all know that John Wick is going to win in the end and hence the movie doesn't really surprise us at all but if there would've been some turns & twists then maybe this film would've gotten a chance to talk about but relying just on the action part is not at all good for any kinda movie, not even for a John Wick movie is the essence that this film brings upon us.Overall, if you don't want to miss out on one from the franchise, then it's your fate.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","FlashCallahan","25 March 2023","John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table, and earning his battered body, a much deserved freedom.But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe, and forces that turn old friends into foes......First of all, any film that features Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins is a must for any action film aficionado. But to have them in a John Wick film isn't just a dream come true, it's a work of sheer genius. I've had my expectations high for several films this year, such as Pants Man, Cocaine Bore, and Scream VI, which have all let me down.So I tried to lower my expectations for this, but I couldn't. Because this franchise has just been getter bigger and better with each instalment. And does it meet expectations?Too bloody right it does, it's a masterpiece in set pieces and going above and beyond in pleasing the fans.There are five huge set pieces that are wonderfully staged, and they are brutal and unflinching, and usurp anything from the previous three movies.The first is at Shimazus Continental, and although it goes on for a while, it's breathtaking, reminiscent of the shootout at the end of Parrabellum, but with Yen making good use of an everyday household item, and the icing on the cake for this sequence, Wick using nunchucks. That's all you need to know. Wick using nunchucks.The second features again, Yen, but now we have Scott Adkins thrown in. And for good measure, he's wearing a fat suit. Again, beautifully staged, with Wick suffering badly this time at the hands of Adkins, with a beautiful diegetic piece from Le Castlevania, keeping the tradition of the franchise. If you though a pencil was a good weapon, wait until you see what is used here.Thirdly, and arguably the best, we have a shoot out around the Arc De Triumphe. A ballet of cars and bullets that had me on the edge of my seat. It's so seamless and expertly made, I doubt you'll find a better cinematic action scene this decade. It's that beautiful.Fourthly, we have a wonderful over head long take with Wick taking out bad guys from room to room, using the most unique gun of the series. It's literally a blast.And the most bone crunching and funniest sequence is on the steps leading to the church. It puts The Exorcist to shame.All this clocking in at nearly three hours, and I didn't once find the film bloated or lagging. As for Reeves, he's a movie star. Some of his acting is pretty questionable in the film, but the man has screen presence, and by his performance, he's dedicated to the cause of Wick.What let the side down a little was Skarssgards pantomime portrayal of the villain. He's far too camp to be in the least but threatening, and the 'help' Wick received from the tracker was a little too convenient at times.But minor quibble aside, this is a masterpiece of action, it's balls to the wall from the moment you see the Thunder Road PC logo, right until the fade of the last scene.This is everything you've expected and more. If you are a fan of the action genre, see this, you've deserved it.Look out for a Wilhelm scream, and a stinger.'Chefs Kiss'","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","masonsaul","25 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action masterpiece, an emotionally investing, unashamedly pretentious and extremely satisfying final chapter that continues to celebrate stunt work as the art form it absolutely is and deliver franchise high spectacle that really does put the majority of other action films to shame.Keanu Reeves is even more agile than ever and continues to really impress in the action despite being 4 films in. Once again though, it's not just the action he excels at with the sense of finality this time around adding a sombre and contemplative nature to his performance that is beautiful.The supporting cast is insanely stacked, a definite new record for this franchise. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne play to their familiar strengths and really dial them up. Then there's the newcomers, starting with Shamier Anderson who has a really interesting angle to his character that's a lot of fun.Rina Sawayama makes a terrific screen debut and has great chemistry with Hiroyuki Sanada who can do no wrong and his reunion with Reeves is a joy to see. Bill Skarsg√•rd is another memorable villain for this franchise as a character who dresses like a gentleman but acts like the complete opposite.Scott Adkins plays against type in hilarious fashion and then there's Donnie Yen. Obviously he's perfect in the action scenes and just so cool but on top that he's one of the best characters because his conflict with John isn't as black and white as previous antagonists, making it all the more interesting.Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, the action scenes are still super clean and impeccably choreographed. There's a nightclub scene that actually improves over the original, a fight in oncoming traffic that's jaw droppingly good and a one take that is one of the best of all time.The film also offers an excellent reminder that Stahelski is an amazing visual stylist as well. With Dan Laustsen's cinematography he creates a beautifully film that makes each location visually unique and the lighting in particular is just stunning throughout.The pacing is so good, gaining momentum early on and never letting up. The music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard is once again incredible, bringing back all the greatest hits without solely relying on them and actually creating the most unique score of the four with plenty of new pieces.","3/10"

I was looking forward to it because I like Keanu Reeves and Scott Adkins, but the fight scenes are atrocious, they are so slow and out of sync, multiple times I noticed actors waiting to be hit, and in the background you can clearly see the actors missing each other, in one scene the Chinese woman was fighting with two bad guys and as one of the went to hit her, he clearly stops to give her time, which is so amateur, it's embarrassing. I remember the other three films, and I must say the first one was the best.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","darryl-johnson","24 March 2023","Ridiculous, ultra violent and nearly 3 hours long 'John Wick: 4' is pure escapism at its finest. No one goes to see a 'John Wick' movie for anything remotely close to realistic fights or gun battles- it's about the body count, hand to hand combat and just how far the director will take things as John absorbs so much abuse yet hardly comes away with a scratch!I usually avoid movies like this however will admit it took my mind off the daily crap of life. This one is much better than the last one- Halle Berry's character was more annoying to me than a female killing machine complement to Keanu Reeves' character.There are scenes in Paris, New York and Berlin - topnotch cinematography that surpasses the other films. And the fight scenes are well scripted- kudos to the work Reaves and the stunt people put in to make them outrageously entertaining!Is this the last film in the series?Maybe... However if this brings in a ton of money rest assured there will be another one.","7/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","scootm16","30 March 2023","As of now, this is the best movie of 2023; that being said, it still has it's issues. I'll start by saying the action sequences (all 9,000 of them) are breathtakingly choreographed. John Wick's trademarked 'GunFu' is on full display in Chapter 4 (for better or worse). This chapter easily has the highest body count out of the series, but you can't rely on bodies and bullets as your main focal point, especially if it's supposedly the last chapter (I highly doubt it is). Wick is weighed down by plot armor so thick it deflects literally everything, including the viewer's belief that Mr. Wick will ever be in any danger. Hit by 10 cars? Tis but a scratch!My main issue with Chapter 4 is that the plot is very thin and it's stretched out over 3 hours. This chapter is very 'Beginning. Middle. End'. The beginning and end are 5 minutes a piece, while the middle is two and a half hours of John effortlessly walking through goons (which is great, until it's not). I love me some Wick slaughtering goons, but when 95% of the movie is gun fire, you begin to forget what the plot even is, what the movie's even about, which is not good. This movie could've easily been cut down to 2 hours if they edited the fight scenes to a reasonable time, so I hope you don't like plot with your action.Another gripe I had is the fact that John Wick had like maybe 10 lines of dialogue? The guy barely spoke a word throughout the entirety of the movie, and when he did speak, 99% of the time it was him going ""Yeah..."" (which is great, until it's not). Maybe use Keanu/Wick as a vehicle for the plot instead of having him be a mute protagonist of an FPS video game? He's the title character for God sake! In Chapters 1 and 2, Wick showed a lot of emotion and vulnerability through dialogue and acting (at least more than this chapter) to express himself, but in this he is pretty much the Doomslayer. Also, is it just me or was Keanu's acting extra bad in this one? The line delivery sometimes was just... oof, even for Keanu standards.My favorite part of the movie is a top-down one-take scene near the end where Wick is blasting through goons with incendiary ammo.Overall, the movie is a good time and if you're a Wick fan, then you won't be disappointed. I'd say this is a step up from Chapter 3, but not as good as 1 and 2.7.2/10.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","subxerogravity","24 March 2023","Far better than I was expecting. Not that I thought it was going to be a bad movie in the slightest, but I was not expecting to be so bedazzled by it. John Wick has stepped up to the plate and hit that man meal out of the park every single time. Keanu Reeves and filmmaker Chad Stahelski have done everything in their power to keep the action constant.The odd part about that is that this movie did not have the best action sequences out of all the movies, but it did have the most in depth story. That itself is odd considering that John Wick movies are not about story. That is why this whole thing started over the fact that the son of some crime boss killed the dog his late wife gave him. It's a humorous plot that commits to the Franchise's statie of action film plots, but this movie decides to take itself a little more serious than all the others, really focusing on how far Wick has gone down the rabbit hole snice the first film. Surprising but not bad.Then you have the action, done by some of the best in the world. John Wick 4 feels like one of those episodes of the Mandalorian that's not about the Mandalorian at all. Afterall when you have Donnie Yen in the movie you want to make sure he's doing as many cool action sequences as possible, which means that there were a few times in this movie in which John disappears to allow others to shine. Great as far as the action.Also great, Scott Adkins in a fat suit.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","claudio_carvalho","13 June 2023","Since I joined IMDb in 2003, my reviews are composed by a summary without spoiler, opinion and the Brazilian title. ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is one of those movies where it is not possible to write a summary since there is no storyline, only stupid fights and shootings all the time, along almost three hours. There is also a tour in France and Germany, and nice scenarios simulating Japan. One of the most stupid scenes is when people continue to dance, despite the shootings and fights at the same place. John Wick is probably from Krypton, since he is gunshot, hit by at least five cars and jumps off buildings on the street and nothing happens to him. The dog ""Nuts"" is responsible for the best scene in this forgettable movie. Funny also to see is the Metascore and the IMDb ratings for this film. The sheeple believe in them. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""John Wick 4: Baba Yaga""","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","pandapipsi","30 May 2023","I'll keep it short and simple. This movie franchise is literally Tugg Speedmans Scorcher with Tuggs trailers in the beginning of tropic thunder perfectly desicribing the plot of these 4 movies. Bad guy kills 100000 assassins and survives. Now he has to kill 100000 more guys to get to the bottom of this whole thing. Then some new villains try to get him and he must kill 100000 more guys. Then in 2023, he's BACK to kill more guys. And let's not fool ourselves, there will be a 5th movie because why not. People keep drooling all over themselves because ""action"". This movie currently sits at a 8.0 on imdb, 0.2 below a classic action flick like Die Hard. That is actually ridiculous.At this point these movies are getting so silly I'm actually embarrassed to go watch another. I brought my girlfriend to the premiere of this movie and felt like a idiot the whole drive back because these movies have rid themselves of ANY meaningful dialogue, the script is actually objectively trash and the acting just isn't there. I was EMBARRASSED on the drive home from cinema. If this was any other movie it would get trashed, but because the first one was a pretty good revenge flick and because Reeves is so lovable this franchise gets a pass. I don't get how people parade this movie like some kind of awesome masterpiece when it's so obvious what a cash grab this is just riding on the back of the first movie. Do better.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","eoinpgeary","23 March 2023","John Wick Chapter 4 comes with a bang! John wants to clear his name and be done with the table but the route of getting there this time is much harder a task than we have seen before.There are so many highlights of the movie, the action was all superb ! I already after first watch have a favourite which is hard to pick as there are some AMAZING sequences in the movie. I won't say the location because I want to give nothing away but I will say in Paris with a lot of traffic !This movie delves into the characters way more than before, we get really good time with the side characters, usually a movie like this would give them 10-15 minutes screen time and kill them while this isn't the case, in the time sense. We get motive, we get their struggle and really good interactions with John. My favourite side characters were Nobody, Shimazu, and Caine.John takes some hits, serious fall damage but these are the movies not real life hahaha. It's a spectacle on a grand scale.Very small nitpicks, the fights are all superb but I would like some more intimate fights for eg JW1, when they entered his house it felt more threatening, and that's it hahaha it's personal preference as a nitpick which is pretty darn good.JW4 is definitely the best of the sequels and up there with the first in my opinion! 8.5/10.","10/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","JohnDeSando","24 March 2023","""You'll run out of bullets before they run out of heads."" Winston (Ian McShane with ascot)For John Wick: Chapter IV, the heads keep rolling, mostly decommissioned by the titular assassin's preternaturally accurate gun, and partly because it seems everyone now wears a bulletproof jacket often used as a shield. Hence the efficiency and necessity of one or two shots to the cranium. And very little blood, which I don't miss at all, given that, like sex, I don't need more than a glance to get it.As with most cinema, even impossibly successful runs like this thriller juggernaut, it's about storytelling even when it's about beautifully-choreographed fight sequences that mix martial arts with high-end weaponry that includes a ""dragon's breath shotgun""! The story is as old as movies themselves: global corporate hoodlums, The Table, are after assassin John Wick, a wicked former employee. The rep is the smarmy Marguis (Bill Skarsgard), decked out in three-piece suits, the brighter the better, and cravats louder than Winston's (thank you costume designer Paco Delgado).Wait till you see the wild-ass fight on a lengthy set of Parisian stairs or sit across from Killa (Scott Adkins, a martial arts expert), an almost sumo-sized card dealer. His silver teeth take us back to a memorable menace in the James Bond canon.It's all very stylish, no doubt because of returning director Chad Stahelski's penchant for colorful neo-noir and writers Shay Hatten and Michael Finch's ability to take the fantasy into new/old motifs such as a duel that Clint Eastwood would approve. They also supply lines like ""Second chances are the refuge of men who fail"" in a film where memorable dialogue is not what the audience expected.Who would expect set pieces such as combat in the Louvre and around the Arc de Triumph? Or better, who has a budget to afford those glories? Well, the producer of one of the most lucrative crime thriller series in cinema history that takes us to Germany, Japan, and France with ease.I can't predict if Keanu Reeves will return, he with a fortune now probably greater than Croesus' (I hear Reeves is generous with his wealth), because one of the great lines from John's Japanese friend, Shimazu ( Hiroyuki Sanada), in this murderous ballet is ""Have you given any thought to how this ends?""I have, and I hope it returns if it has more of the absurd style and beautiful ballet peppered with dialogue as sharp as the swords that dispatch very sharp baddies. John Wick: Chapter IV is as good as the best action films we will see all summer, and that bountiful crop has yet to start. Stay tuned.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","PlotThicc","24 March 2023","JW4 is exceptional!! If you're gunna see anything this wkd, see John Wick Chapter 4.It's a nonstop, adrenaline-fueled rollercoaster ride full of tension, action and suspense. And you don't have to be up to speed with the other JW films, necessarily. The 2nd Act is dedicated to JW enthusiasts, but it's not too difficult to follow.There's also an unrecognizable moviestar in hair & makeup (and a fat suit) that I clocked (I won't spoil it--yet). He is hilarious in the role -- very much like Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) in ""Tropic Thunder.""The 3rd Act of JW4 is worth the price of admission. This is, by far, the best movie of the year (so far) and the last hour is one of the best finales of any action film in recent memory.Shoutout to the production crew. This film doesn't work without the crew. The stunt coordinators, the sound mixers/designers, safety staff, grips, hair & makeup, choreographers, costumers and the animal trainers.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","mahdinaimi","2 April 2023","I normally don't write reviews but this movie just pushed the boundaries of absurdity so far that I just can't say nothing!We get it, John Wick never dies, OK!But at least put a tiny bit of reason into the movie!! He jumps out of the window from the third floor, lands on car, THE CAR'S ROOF GETS SMASHED!!!, but he just stands up and continues fighting???And some scenes are so ridiculous that the whole cinema was laughing. Like the scene near the ending where he is literally just rolling himself down the staircase for no reason! You can literally see him push his arms to the ground to roll one more stair flight down!Even if you don't think about what you're watching, the action scenes get boring too quickly! Repetitive style of fighting, same movements from Chapter 1, and then covering themselves from bullets with just a sleeve (???) And then penetrating that sleeve with a knife!I felt like Keanu Reeves was just telling me ""Give me your money and don't think about what I'm showing you, cuz I like the money!""Seriously! The movie had nothing new to show! Same old story... same old fighting... literally nothing new! We get it, you make good fortune out of this!

"John Wick: Chapter 4","MrDHWong","23 March 2023","""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is the fourth film in the ""John Wick"" franchise. Once again directed by Chad Stahleski and starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, it stands out as not only the best film in the series but also as one of the very best action films made in recent decades.Shortly after the events of the third film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is in the planning stages of taking down the powerful High Table once and for all. After executing the Elder (George Georgiou), a man ranked above the High Table, John travels to Osaka to seek refuge in their local Continental Hotel. While there, John learns from the manager that his old blind friend Caine (Donnie Yen) and a bounty hunter known only as ""Mr. Nobody"" (Shamier Anderson) have each been ordered to assassinate him by a High Table member named Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd). As he fights off various other assassins, John eventually meets up with New York's Continental manager Winston Scott (Ian McShane), who may hold the key to disbanding the High Table permanently.Almost a decade since its debut, the ""John Wick"" series has cemented itself as one of the most popular action film franchises to ever grace movie theatres. The films are known for their highly stylised action scenes, memorable supporting characters, and intriguing world building elements that always make audiences come back for more. At the centre of it all is of course Keanu Reeves, who has helped the titular character become one of the most recognisable action heroes of all time. Now four films in, you would expect the series to show signs of losing some steam but ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" proves all doubters wrong with an exhilarating action-packed experience that leaves other similar films in the dust.Now that he's ""excommunicado"", the stakes are at an all time high as we see John facing off against even more dangerous adversaries than before. Anybody who's watched these films since the beginning will know that John's worldwide infamy makes it increasingly difficult for him to find allies willing to assist, especially considering how the bounty on his head keeps rising with every powerful enemy he makes. Because of that, there's more tension this time around than in previous entries, allowing less room for error at the risk of sudden death. Most of the time, John relies solely on his own wit and ingenuity to take out his enemies, whether it's with his simple handgun or with any part of the surrounding environment. John is a resourceful assassin, not blinding shooting at any moving target but instead calculating the right time and technique to take out a particular foe, no matter how minor. It is this trait that separates a character like John Wick from the rest of the typical action heroes, as contemplating his next move is what has made him so interesting to watch over the past four films.Something else I've admired about ""John Wick"" series is the attention-to-detail that goes into virtually every scene. Regardless of where things are taking place, there's so much visual beauty and creativity on display in each shot. This film is certainly no exception as it contains some truly breathtaking cinematography that places the audience right at the forefront of the action. If these scenes don't rejuvenate you, then you probably have no pulse. From the brightly coloured neon lights of Osaka to the raving nightlife of Berlin, every location oozes so much personality that they almost become characters in their own right. It is in these places that some of the best choreographed, best edited, and best filmed fight scenes in recent memory are able to firmly establish this fourth entry as one of the most exciting action films to ever be released in theatres. Yet despite all the frenetic shoot-outs and hand-to-hand combat, they are all handled with such careful precision that it is still easy to follow everything happening without losing focus of who is fighting who. And to top it all off, at no point is shaky cam ever used during the action scenes, which makes these already entertaining segments even better.For someone approaching his 60s, Keanu Reeves shows absolutely no signs of slowing down in the iconic lead role. Every shot that he fires, every punch that he throws, and every sword that he swings proves that Reeves can still hold his own alongside any younger cast members. There were even times where I couldn't help but notice some of the other supporting cast struggling to keep up with Reeves, which helped make him stand out quite considerably. Although the character of John Wick has never really had a huge amount of depth behind him, he definitely has a level of intrigue, something I think Reeves is able to play into perfectly. He is man of few words, whose widespread notoriety and respect from other assassins combined with his compassion for the defenseless makes him an endearing hero for the audience to cheer for. After all, it's easy to care about somebody who has risked everything to avenge the death of his dog.Additionally, I don't think the film would have worked half as well without John's two worthy opponents - Donnie Yen as Caine and Shamier Anderson as Mr. Nobody. Yen's depiction of Caine draws comparisons to that of Marvel's Daredevil, in that he is blind but a highly skilled martial artist relying on his other senses to defeat enemies. Caine's proficiency in combat is so unparalleled that each time I saw him fight I kept forgetting about his blindness since his reflexes are so unusually fast. However, what I liked most was the mutual respect between him and John, being that they were once close friends in the past. On the other hand, Mr. Nobody is completely different as he has no personal connection to John. He is only doing this job for the money but along the way he learns that John is a force to be reckoned with. It is interesting to watch how Mr. Nobody learns more about John as the film progresses, and Anderson successfully brings out all the necessary layers of curiosity surrounding his character.Even after four movies, the ""John Wick"" series is still as impactful as it was when it first started, with each film being better than the last. What began as a relatively straightforward story of a man seeking revenge against those who killed his dog is now a multi-layered, action-packed, and beautifully shot set of films that exists within its own meticulously crafted world. This fourth film has not only helped redefine the series as a whole but also what action movies are capable of in general. Personally, I would love to see another ""John Wick"" film but according to director Chad Stahleski, this will be the last one for a while with the spin-off film ""Ballerina"" and miniseries ""The Continental"" coming soon to fill the void in the meantime. Either way, it looks like this series is here to stay.I rate it a solid 9/10.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","A7medSalah","24 March 2023","As thrilling and relentless as any action movie before it, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an adrenaline injection with Oscar worthy stunt work, assured direction and Keanu Reeves as magnetic as ever. The best Chapter yet...John Wick: Chapter 4 feels like a film where Director Chad Stahelski understood that he finally had the freedom and the budget to do, literally, anything he wanted on the screen-and might never again-so by God, he was going to do it.With characters able to dodge bullets left, right and centre, the film is a homage to the classic martial-arts genre with a sprinkling of old Hollywood Westerns where protagonists never seem to run out of ammunition or ways to stay alive.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg√•rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.","10/10"

Then you've come to the right place in Hollywood. Hollywood is for the mob what was once the arena in ancient Rome, but the light version. The rabble, ignorant, feasting on big screens where violence is shown as necessary, tough and sexy. John Wick is like American porn: do you like chocolate? Then we'll drown you in it. The film has a total lack of drama, a total lack of imagination and, even worse, a total lack of humour. After the umpteenth headshot I look bored at my lukewarm popcorn. Kenau Reeves, the Internet's darling of good deeds, plays a depressed killer in a black suit who does nothing but kill people. A feast to watch for the poor in spirit.

Who are they?) and then kills The Elder who's just sitting there, with very little fanfare in the middle of nowhere, no protection or even servants, I was immediately underwhelmed. This is supposed to be like a big deal, yet it felt meaningless.After that, it's just a bunch of barely credible fight scenes, over and over and over and over... All with convenient bulletproof clothing, and apparently none of these trained killers and thousands of bullets can hit the man's head. The cream of the crop is at the Arc de Triomphe, where he gets hit by four cars no less and just walks it off each time. Or where he jumps 4-5 stories high and slams his body basically head first on a parked car, and just walks that off too. Or when he falls down 222 stairs and walks THAT off.In the end, this is all just a cheap video game, where your character goes from set piece to set piece and has to shoot his way out; but in God mode.This thing is getting great reviews all over.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","benjaminskylerhill","23 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 joins Mad Max: Fury Road in being the fourth film in an action franchise that is also hands-down the best film in its franchise.The pacing issues present in the last two movies are nowhere to be seen here; remarkable, given the behemoth 169-minute runtime. It absolutely earns that runtime with action sequences that never once feel repetitive and a plot that is always moving.Every single gloriously carnage-filled set piece introduces unique geography, weaponry, and style to the mix so that every scene is more shocking and thrilling than the last. I can't remember the last time I was so consistently entertained for nearly three straight hours.This time around there are also several new characters introduced, and they're all given much more personality and narrative purpose than anything we've seen before in these films. For the first time in four movies, I actually got invested in the story on multiple levels rather than just being thoroughly entertained by the action.But it must also be acknowledged that this movie is absolutely insane, and is not meant to be taken seriously. John Wick is an invincible man, frequently surviving things no man can possibly survive. If implausibility bothers you, this will be your nightmare.The story does try to dive deeper into the theme of ""actions have consequences, and nobody is immune to consequences"" that was touched upon in the previous movies. I commend them for trying, but it's still done in a far too surface-level way to be impactful. The writers really glossed over some pretty heavy plot points whose consequences should have been explored in greater detail, and because of this, I didn't feel anything I think they wanted me to feel when the film ended.But this is a minor complaint for a movie like this. Chapter 4 is the display of a master action filmmaker who continues to dare to go bigger and bolder, and I can't wait to see what kind of spectacle he presents us with next.","1/10"

Watching a stunt man stumble around for five seconds until Keanu was ready for him took me right out of it.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","talking_about_movies","26 July 2023","I liked this movie much more than I thought I would. Long story short, no JW sequel has reached even close to what I felt during the 1st movie. While it's the same for this movie as well, I'm still surprised because I liked it more than both 2 and 3.First of all, let me get the problems out of the way. I still have the same problems as I did with most of the JW sequels. John Wick is able to fight 100 people in groups, and they don't attack simultaneously even when they can. An enemy waits till John Wick has finished fighting the other guy, and then makes his entrance. They wait till they are in close combat and then take out their gun, only to be disarmed by Wick. Seeing things like these again and again just takes away all the tension from the action scenes. And there isn't really much of a plot, nor is there much of a script. The more this series is continuing, the less I'm caring about the characters.But you know what, that's enough for flaws. I still had a lot of fun watching this movie. I absolutely adored the way Chad Stahelski filmed the action scenes. There's a long action scene in a certain house, and we get to see a view from above, making the length of the scene even cooler. The action set pieces, not scenes, but the set pieces are awesome. Seriously, so cool. There's an action scene that takes place on the road around a roundabout - easily my favourite scene in the movie and one of the best action scenes I've seen in recent times. And this is a 3-hour movie, so it has like 2.5 hours worth of action. The entire movie is just full of action. And I had a lot of fun seeing many different, innovative action set pieces along with the way Stahelski directed them. There are a few interesting new characters as well, that actually stole the show from John.Overall this movie had some very innovative action scenes, some charismatic new characters and I had plenty of fun watching it. But it's still in the same bucket as the rest of the sequels, even if it's better than them.","2/10"

Then, as the body count exceeded what I thought to be roughly 15 thousand souls, I started to feel like I was missing out on life. The feeling grew exponentially, with every batch of 5 thousand casualties.When John Wick began his ascent to the top of Sacr√© Coeur, where he faced a hundred new villains (probably the planet's last surviving human male specimens), I considered leaving. But it was Mr. Nobody yelling his ""balls"" cormmand (whereupon his dog jumps at a man's crotch, and then urinates over his dead body) that achieved the feat.On my way home, I reminisced about the good old days, when an action-loaded, far-fetched but highly entertaining movie could be squeezed into 87 minutes (e.g. Commando, 1985; btw. 51% of the running time of John Wick: Chapter 4).Anyway, ChatGPT informs me that ""There is no clear evidence to suggest that watching stupid films or any other form of entertainment can significantly lower a person's IQ,"" so it's not all bad.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","AnotherRandomReviewer","11 October 2023","I loved the first John Wick movie and while the second one had problems, I like how they expanded the lore of the assassin's guild he was part of. Then in John Wick 3 the lore, story and characters all started to be massively overshadowed by the action. And then we get John Wick 4, the video game.Or should I say John Wick the super hero movie because he might as well be one because he is so unkillable. Anyways, every scene has a perfunctory bit of acting just to set the stage for massively overlong and frankly ridiculous action scenes. John Wick is supposed to be good at fighting but no person is so good that they can take down masses of near-peer skilled enemies. By the end of the movie I was looking at the clock when the action scenes were happening.And don't get me started on the massively stupid trope of the blind assassin that is in this movie. Just stop it already. The guy hunting Wick does things over and over again that are simply impossible. It was just ridiculous that we are supposed to believe he would last more than a few seconds against a skilled, assassin trained opponent.Overall, the movie is a steep disappointment. It was stylishly filmed and is a treat visually, the acting is not bad, and the fights are good to a point but then they go on and on and on so you lose interest.This should be the last John Wick film. And for anyone who is thinking about watching the series for the first time, just stop after the first. That's all you need. The rest is downhill.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","nscoby93","24 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 as with the past three films continues to develop its world, its characters, goes bigger with the amazing action set pieces, and amazing fight chrography.One of my biggest concerns going into this film was its run time as I have felt the John Wick movies do not garner a two plus hour film so if they want to do a movie that's damn near three hours then the story needed to deliver...And I am very happy to say they delivered with great storytelling.The film did not start as fast as I anticipated it would but instead opened up establishing new characters and its story. In fact John was barely in the first half hour of the movie which I was surprised by but it was a very welcome change of pace.The action sequences are bigger and better than we have ever seen before, they've always managed to top themselves movie to movie and Chapter 4 is no different.But the absolute standout action sequence for me is in this abandoned French home in the third act of the film. It was fantastically choreographed, and the camera work was phenomenal and truly unique. Whatever the camera crew is making its not enough.Some certain issues for me, where as I didn't feel the run time for the most part I did begin to feel fatigue during an action sequence in the third act. It felt prolonged to me and I just wanted to move forward with things. But the movie never felt to have dragged and was entertaining and engaging through its entire run time.Lastly I would like to say some words about the recently passed Lance Riddick. While his character Charon was small, his impact was anything but small. The John Wick world, and The Continental Hotel will not be the same without it's courteous and always professional concierge, he will be missed! As Winston said...""He was a friend""If this is the final Chapter in the John Wick storyline then I am very pleased with its conclusion but as I mentioned there's plenty of opportunity for more in this world.IMDb: 9/10

"John Wick: Chapter 4","artera-27398","24 June 2023","With all due respect to the people who liked this movie, the first one was a good movie, lsa 2 and 3 passable, but this one has been insufferable, long, tedious, boring, when you see a movie and you're looking forward to it ending , to find out what ghostly ending they invent, shows that it is not a good movie.When I go to see an action movie, I look for an action movie, ""bourne"", ""revenge"", etc, if I want to go see a science fiction one, I like that there are spaceships, and if I want to see a superhero one, That's what I want to see, this movie is so unrealistic that it doesn't connect with the viewer at any time, at least not with me.Whoever liked it, I'm glad you like this type of cinema, but I don't like ""Fast & Furious"" style ghosts, so in my opinion, it's not that I left the cinema disappointed, I left pissed off for having lost almost three hours.","6/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Xstal","27 March 2023","If stunning fight scenes are your thing you'll be in awe, as the battles start quite soon and lead to more, hand to hand, with guns and swords, not much dialogue, no time for words, as the blood is spilt, the casualties do soar. The geography begins in New York City, not too later in Osaka things get gritty, Berlin really bares its teeth, as several more become deceased, and in Paris things get wild, and somewhat tricky.Nothing you haven't seen before but perhaps not on this scale, as The High Table appoint a Marquis to remove John Wick and all he represents, employing traditional tactics and approaches not unbecoming of a film of this nature.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","j-sporrer","25 March 2023","The story was ok but could have been better flushed out. Fight scenes are great but they were way too long and so unrealistic. Not nearly as good as the other 3 movies. If they would have given us a little more background on some of the new characters it would have made more sense and given them more depth. In previous movies John would use his Krav Magra skills to take down or slow down someone then a double tap to the head would usually be sufficient. Those fight scenes were outstanding and believable. Almost all of fights in this movie ridiculous. People were shot and stabbed several times and looked like they weren't hurt. How many times did John get hit by a car and just walked away? How many times do you have to hit someone in the face with nunchucks before they go down. I used to think John was special. The Baba Yaga. But in this version he is made to look almost invincible. Really, did they have to get so far away from reality this time. I left somewhat disappointed. Was I watching a movie or a video game?","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","nathan-102-340277","3 April 2023","My son and I love the John Wick movies but both agreed this was really bad. There were a few creative aspects to the fight scenes, cinematography and effects, but in terms of the writing the whole movie was just one long incessant fight scene repeated what felt like hundreds of times without any story to break it up or make any of it matter at all to the viewer. In action movies it's obviously about the action and not much is needed to make the story 'matter' but my goodness at least have the basics of an actual story that makes the action compelling in some basic way. There were a number of excellent actors in this movie but sadly the writing made it so that even they couldn't contribute anything to the story. Went in excited but I seriously wanted to walk out about half way through when I realized it was just going to be non-stop fight scenes and nothing else for 3 whole hours. It was truly mind-numbing.","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","gettodamoofies","8 August 2023","FILM: 8.5/10.Stepping back into the world of John Wick feels like catching up with an old friend after some eight years and change. John Wick: Chapter 4 breathes new life into the franchise, evolving from the simplicity of its origins to a dazzling globetrotting spectacle. The once straightforward narrative has given way to a complex web of characters and a runtime that'll test your bladder's limits.Gone are the simple days of the first film. In their place, we're treated to a symphony of the most elaborate action sequences the series has seen. John's departure in the third installment would suggest consequences, but he's back, more formidable than ever, training to unleash hell on his adversaries. The film begins dramatically, setting the tone for the adrenaline rush to come.Bill Skarsg√•rd's Marquis Vincent de Gramont enters the fray, and the story moves to Osaka, introducing the captivating performances of Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen. Their martial arts skills and character depth elevate the film, with Yen's smart action blending seamlessly with well-placed humor, while Sanada exudes his signature honor.From the Osaka battle, the action ramps up, treating us to a visual feast of various combat styles. The film takes us on a global journey as John strives to reclaim his standing, encountering memorable characters along the way. Scott Adkins in prosthetics and a change of scenery to France further diversify the action-packed narrative.As the film barrels towards its climax, it finds a welcome respite in an old-school type of action, offering a satisfying balance between the serious tone of the first film and the ludicrousness of the third. Chad Stahelski and his team manage to strike this delicate balance, leaving us enthralled by brilliant choreography.While the endless fight scenes might feel repetitive on repeat viewings, the film's end credits tantalizingly hint at the possibility of more to come. Personally, I'd be content with leaving it here, but the allure of financial success may bring the franchise back to the screen before long. In the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers a heart-pounding ride that manages to honor its roots while pushing the boundaries of its action-packed universe.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 10/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.","7/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","judealexharnett","6 January 2024","I have to say that I feel really let down by this movie. The first three films in this series were brilliant and I had high hopes for this one but I can say that It met them. First off the opening half an hour in this film may be one of my favourites ever. All the samurai and stuff against The high table agents was just so cool.Unfortunately I believe the movie went down from there. For the most part it was the same as the last movie. John wick is excommunicado and being hunted down but has a couple allies and even more enemies. The dialogue in this movie is extremely short but if say its pretty well done. However this movie being so narratively weak and nearly 3 hours long is not a good thing in my opinion. Even with all the action scenes i felt the movie crawling along for a large portion of the film.Im gonna be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of the ending either. Now I do understand the fact that John came to terms with the fact that he needed to embrace death and all of that but it just felt so underwhelmed due to how much fighting and murdering he went through in the past 3 movies to not die. Also like this dude has been shot, stabbed, hit with several cars and fell at least 50 feet and landed on his back, yet 3 bullet wounds kill him? A bit silly if you ask me. 8/10.","1/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","nashezzubair","7 January 2024","When you start watching a John Wick movie, you expect it to be a non stop action ride. Thats true for this 4th chapter in the most John Wick way possible and we wouldn't have it any other way.Keanu Reeves' silent assassin John Wick is always a treat to watch. People do complain about his lack of dialogue but in this setting it works to his advantage as the action tells most of the story. John Wick is a force of nature, something everybody fears to be the other side of his gun. And in this movie, its maximum carnage from him.Can't believe that 4 movies in and the director Chad Stahelski and his stunt choreography team haven't let us get bored of the action yet. Its surprisingly refreshing in every movie and each builds on top of the previous one, raising the bar higher. The story's tightly knit too, so you feel like the fight scenes organically come out of it and never feel forced.An amazingly entertaining watch, as expected from the John Wick movies.","7/10"

I've seen a lot of films and I think this is the best action film I've seen. Definitely the best action film saga. I had to wait in the theater for a long time because I was just so blown away by how well made this film was.The lighting has evolved with each movie and it was absolutely stunning. And that goes along with the cinematography. Just absolutely beautiful shots. And of course the choreography was incredibly well orchestrated. AND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE STUNTS. There seriously needs to be an Oscar for choreography and stunt work.This one is for Lance Reddick. We all love him and will miss him dearly. Bravo.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","TxMike","7 August 2023","This movie opens with a scene of John Wick riding a horse in a desert somewhere in an Arab country, he is shooting at several men riding horses ahead of him. After killing all of them he meets a man on a rug in the desert, after a few minutes kills him execution style. All in the first 6 minutes, and we have no idea why.As the movie progresses we see additional execution style killings. My biggest question at that point was ""Why does a really nice guy in real life, Keanu Reeves, so willingly play a character that has no regard for the lives of others?"" Is it just for the big payday?The way IMDb sorts user reviews here, the ""featured"" reviews are stacked by ""helpful"", which really means ""do you agree with the review?"" Almost all of them rate this movie rather low, typically ""3"" or ""4"", yet the overall rating is 7.8 at this writing. That is a disconnect.I suppose all those who consider this to be a superior movie also just enjoy seeing a supposedly ""good guy"" kill lots of supposedly ""bad guys"", in a ""judge, jury, and executioner"" type of role. Well this sort of movie is not for me. I don't enjoy that. While the production values are high the movie itself is not that good.I watched it at home on DVD from my public library. About the first John Wick, which I watched in 2015, I wrote in part ""... this kind of movie glorifies point-blank execution killing justified because the guys being killed work for a Russian mafia in New York. But it still cheapens life and we simply have too much of that in our movies.""So nothing has changed. I didn't see Wick 2 and Wick 3 and now I have no desire to.","6/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","adhipar","27 March 2023","This movie has the same plot as before: John Wick against the rest of the assassin world with longer running time. What is good with a longer duration is the characters can be well developed, and I really like that Donnie Yen, Shamir Anderson, Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins have enough time to show their acting. Especially Donnie and Scott. Hiroyuki/Henry Sanada has seriously acted on several movies so he's natural.Another benefit with longer duration is of course more actions! However, I'm a bit dissapointed about this, because it doesn't mean that to make it longer, those henchmen should be too hard too kill as if they were zombies which you need to punch, kick, throw, shot on the knee, leg, abdomen, chest and finally their head to finally died. For those troops with full body armor (in Continental hotel set) this is still logical. But for those thugs in Paris who were not use a bulletproof suits, this become silly. I don't understand why John Wick didnt try to break their neck or shot their heads to quickly eliminate them.Not only those thugs are zombies, John Wick should also a zombie since he fell from 2nd/3rd floor several times, get stabbed, punched kicked, hit by car also several time, fall down and roll over on hundreds of steps and still can get up and seems fine.And I totally loss it when there's a shooting duel, with one of the participant is blind!. I really want the movie to be finished asap.However, as I said, the character development is nice and the gun-fu which are shot from above from room to room is also memorable. I quite enjoyed them. 7/10.","7/10"

That sliver in New York.Its concierge is still Lance Reddick as ""Charon"".The wonderful actor and voice actor who died recently at age 60, which makes his appearance even sadder.The villain of this instalment is one of modern cinemas finest, Bill Skarsgard as ""Marquis"".If you loved him as ""Pennywise"" in ""IT"" just wait to see if the balloons all float down here too in Wickland.Hiroyuki Sanada is a fine actor who heads up the Osaka Hotel in Japan as ""Shimazu"" where some of the best action takes place.Plus of course Lawrence Fishburne as the ""Bowery King"" and tailor to Johnathon...especially the 42 regular Kevlar suit.Donnie Yen is back as ""Caine"".Proving even a blind man can tell when he's walking in the Sun or shooting bad guys using door bells.Shamier Anderson is ""The Tracker"" or ""Mr Nobody"" who with the help of his faithful killer dog takes care of business as a gun for hire.Clancy Brown with his marvellous bass/baritone voice is ""The Harbinger"" of mostly bad news.One unbelievable death defying fight scene after another plays out during the longest ""John Wick"" chapter ever at 2hrs 49 minutes...especially considering this movie was designed to be seen on IMAX screens where times should be much shorter.Watch out for: The Arc de Triomphe car chase battle scene and the 200 plus stairs fight.The sound engineering is first class with a great soundtrack.You simply have to throw logic out the door to fully comprehend what's happening on the big screen and just enjoy the ride.It's a thriller and possibly one of the best in this saga that started in 2014.Maybe ""John Wicks"" farewell tour is finally coming to an end.Keanu at 59 is still being excellent to his mates and proving deadly to his enemies, but even Wick can't kill everyone.","6/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","MisterJxroen","23 March 2023","I was fortunate enough to view 'John Wick: Chapter 4' in a double-bill (Chapter 3 prior to 4) avant-premiere screening at the theater with my family. I've always been a great admirer of the practical action sequences portrayed in the 'John Wick' films.Undoubtedly, 'John Wick Chapter 1' remains my favorite, followed closely by Chapter 3. It definitely has something to do with the fact that the type of action and gun-fu felt so new back then. That is also the one main thing this fourth film suffers from in my opinion: innovativeness. Though this issue only really exists throughout the first half of the film.The Paris sequences & pretty much all action sequences featuring Donnie Yen (as 'Caine') serve as a breathe of fresh air in this film. Some new weapons and technology such as the bow & arrow, the nunchucks and some fancy incendiary bullets make certain action scenes a joy to watch. Though the other sequences are certainly cool, I can't help but feel like I've seen it quite a few times already.The cinematography was definitely at it's highest point in this fourth film. The movie was absolutely gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and ultramodern, almost in a science fiction-y way. The way action sequences are shot have always been amazing; from long takes to overhead shots, back to running between cars on the Champs-Elysees and dueling like it's the wild west. It's a lot of bloody fun! I'm slightly saddened by the fact so much action was shot in dark and distractingly lit environments, but overall the practicality of it all was still there.I enjoyed the music more in the prior movies, though I haven't separately listened to the OST yet so I know what to do. Sound design, costumes and world building is another massive win for me. I love this world they've managed to create full of assassins and strange people. It was nice to explore so many different countries and 'continentals'. It really helped with making this film different from the others.Keanu Reeves is always a joy to watch, what else can I say? I'm also very happy they brought in legends like Clancy Brown, Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada. Their skills and overall badass vibes just fit so fell in this world. Speaking of legends, I'm saddened by the recent passing of Lance Reddick, who portrayed 'Charon' the concierge. I'm glad to have seen him one last time in this role and I pay my respects.Overall I rate this film a 8/10, on par for me with chapter 2. If you come to see John Wick absolutely kicking people's ass while also breaking his own back numerous times (you'd think), this is the right film for you. You don't really get a lot of opportunities to breathe, and I love it.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","terrylarosa","29 March 2023","The Wick films now have something in common with another popular franchise; the Road Runner cartoons. Wick is now more invulnerable than Wolverine. Last movie they dropped him off of a building. In this one they do the same but why stop there; they drop him off two buildings with nary a scratch. Wick just gets up and keeps on killing. Who cares right? Certainly not reviewers and critics who are giving this cartoonish movie high praise. But why stop there? Let's let him get hit by no less than 4 moving cars that would have shattered bones in a mere mortal. But let's go for more. Let's drop him not once but twice down hundreds of stairs only for him to get up and kill dozens more. My wife ( having loved the first 3 ) was thoroughly disgusted with this movie and I was quite dismayed myself. Wick peaked in the second brilliant one but they turned this into a stupid Fast and Furious movie defying what punishment a body can take. Wick is not hurt once except in the final gun battle. The movie gets a few stars for the cinematography, stunts and the great first big action action scene in Japan with the equally great Hiroyoki Sanada. Sadly the movie goes downhill from there. Watch for cartoon fun only.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","therealjaysmoke","23 May 2023","Finally got the chance to watch this movie and I have to say, everything you'd expect from a John Wick movies, you got it. From the cinematography to the color grading, to the special Fx. So I wasn't moved by that at all. We all know that 3 was bad, but 4 was abysmal. I don't know what the directors were thinking making the main antagonist, Caine, a BLIND man. I mean, how were you going to sell this to fans of John Wick who know him to be am amazing gunslinger? And you telling me, he can't shoot a blind man dead from a few yards away? What load of rubbish is that? That spoilt the whole movie for me.And then you had Mr Nobody, who I really didn't understand what he was doing in the movie with his dog. Then you had all the awful and predictable fight scenes. It was such a pain to watch, you could tell it wasn't real as the fighters would pause, waiting for Keanu to make a move then they responded. I don't know if it was Keanu who was slow or what, it was just wrong. And the Marquis guy's acting was just terrible.The story was very weak IMO, not as rich as the first and second. This is the 4th chapter, I was expecting something rad! But everything here we've seen before in previous John Wick movies, the only crazy moment was the unexpected death of Winston's concierge.My conclusion is a simple question: how hard is it for a whole John Wick to shoot a blind man?","4/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","nakrugt","26 March 2023","The stunt-work is amazing, let's start with that.Editing is quite nice. So is photography. Acting is not much needed in the movie. At least, acting is not needed as much as stunts. I mean, the action scenes are - how can I put this delicately - impossible or borderline fantasy level unless the whole film is in The Matrix, and also the third film, of course.The character development does not exist, physics does not defy John Wick ever. The opposite cannot be said, though.Even if you turn off your brain and watch, most of it does not make sense, at all.However, if you are into mindless, illogical action scenes, John Wick is the film for you.One more thing, in a gun fight, if you lose to a guy who cannot see, in brightly lit environments, maybe you should give up your career as an assassin. If not, you deserve to get killed in ""action"".

"John Wick: Chapter 4","CinemaClown","26 July 2023","An almost perfect sequel & by all means a fitting finale too, John Wick: Chapter 4 continues the tradition of the franchise going bigger, better & bolder with every subsequent instalment, and is action filmmaking at its most balletic, ballistic & breathtaking. Featuring some truly spectacular set pieces & stellar action choreography, all the while raising the stakes as the story progresses, this fourth entry is an expertly crafted & ingeniously executed offering that delivers on all fronts.Directed by Chad Stahelski, the story presents death's very emissary embarking on a Sisyphean mission of suicidal fury after the events of the last film and is more dramatically compelling than before. Stahelski continues to find new, creative & audacious ways to make the action stand out and takes ideas & inspirations from several classics of the past. There is a sense of urgency this time around that makes the unfolding events all the more restless and keeps the interest alive at all times.The reprising cast is impressive as before but the new additions manage to make their mark too, with Donnie Yen stealing the show among the latter. Reeves is captivating throughout and plays his role with panache. Bill Skarsgard delivers as a worthy villain. And the upgrades in set design & cinematography are notable enough to stand out. Also, after all the merciless bloodbath that ensues before, the decision to end the journey with a traditional duel is a masterstroke that only makes the finale better.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 earns high scores in every aspect and is one of the most pristine & polished examples of blockbuster filmmaking. Making all the genre elements work in absolute harmony to deliver an action extravaganza of the highest order, this immaculately orchestrated dance of death is one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences of the year that effortlessly lives up to its enormous hype and smartly brings the saga of the man, the myth & the legend to a satisfying conclusion. Do svidaniya, Mr. Wick.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Tweetienator","2 June 2023","Well, the first one was real fun and is still the real deal, the other two I can't remember much of but that there was a lot of shooting and fighting and running going on. John Wick: Chapter 4 just provides more of the same and I must state - I was rather indifferent and slightly bored while watching. Don't get me wrong - acting is sufficient, production fine, and there is a lot of action, but the story, well, all that blabla about the High Table and so on, is just redundant noise to set up the stage for different and exotic settings for more bumbum. I really think they should have left the first movie alone. That one is still cool and hot but like the Taken (Liam Neeson) movies with every added ""chapter"" the idea and quality of the story and character thins out. And last but not least, almost three hours running time is something like an overkill ;)","7/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","musings-morsels","20 April 2023","I completely understand the hype, we don't get too many amazing choreographed fights with really clear camera work in movies anymore these days. Donnie Yen and Rina Sawayama's fights were just wow. And some of the shots, although ridiculous, did look beautiful (I'm talking about the club scene where people were still dancing, while the dude next them got axed in the face or Wick doing doughnuts around a bunch of cars with endless bullets), looks great and cool and aesthetically pleasing but after a while, it does make you roll your eyes.It's becoming too outrageous that it's laughable now, getting closer to the fast and furious franchise, which is a shame. When it's so silly, you become less invested in the characters it makes the long ass fight scenes just plain boring. Where it lost points for me is; 1 for the plot, 1 for the dialogue , 1 for Keanu's acting and 1 for the sheer silliness of it all. It really took me out of the moment which made me feel every minute of the 3 hrs run time.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","dantharpe","30 June 2023","The basic story lines in the JW franchise is awesome, but the later sequels since inception has reached a level of absurdity with the human impossibility of physical brutality John could withstand... it is no longer realistic or believable. Many scenes became mundane and ""just another fight scene."" Things like falling from a four story building on to a VW van and walking away, hit by a car (several times) and walking away, brutal fight scenes and walking away, it's all humanly impossible to be considered real. A waste of time and money!If this happened to be the last John Wick film, then so be it! Good bye and good riddance! I give it two stars because of the final scene.","6/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","John94","3 June 2023","The latest edition of John Wick follows the same disappointing footsteps of Chapter 3. The first two John Wick movies were the best because they were more grounded and realistic. Their plot even though it was simple and straightforward it made way more sense than the latest two movies. Having also better writing, being more focused and having better villains helped them quite a lot. Also the fight scenes were far better than this movieAs we see in Chapter 4 the John Wick franchise follows the same path the Fast and Furious movies took. The first movies were the best for obvious reasons as i mentioned above and the more deep they expanded their universe and characters the more dumb the movies became. In this movie we have Daredevil fighting enemies without breaking a sweat and John seems to have complete invulnerability like he is Superman. There isn't any tension, or a sense of thrill or dread and fear in any of the fight scenes they show. The fight scenes in the first two chapters were way better because John/Keanu reacted faster so age does play an important role and most importantly they were directed better being more grounded and realistic. Being smaller scale helped them shine more, and in this one being having big scale set pieces wasn't the best choice. Moreover the villains in this movie they are straight from a fan-fiction cartoon acting incredible dumb, having the worst lines possible that it becomes not fun to watch at all. And don't make me laugh, i cringed so much with the dog and the guy who chases John especially in his last couple of scenes.I generally don't recommend this movie at all and if you are a truly fan of the action genre that respects both the writing and the choreography and fight scenes of these movies i don't recommend this one at all. At least this movie had great cinematography so that's a positive. But in all other aspects from writing, directing and pacing, it did such a bad job.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","aarongnr","23 March 2023","This is a tough one. Not only to review, but also to watch. Never before have I seen a movie where the opponents are so obviously taking turns attacking. There are countless scenes in this movie where John Wick is fighting multiple opponents and every one except the one he is currently fighting is dancing around awkwardly in the background until its their turn to attack. It's infuriating. And it happens constantly throughout the movie.Now, not everything about the action is bad. Some of the fight scenes are awesome, mostly the ones where he is fighting someone one on one.The camera work, scenery, set design are all beautiful. Even the story of this installment is better than what we had previously. The movie also introduces a couple of fantastic new characters and the conclusion is quite satisfying.All that to be completely underminded by the truly atrocious fight choreographies throughout the movie. They made this an absolute chore to watch at times.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Lythas_85","28 May 2023","I think the first one was the best.. because of the introduction of the character and how ruthless he is.The second one was ok and him running away on parabellum started to get crazy and over the top.. him being hunted by every body started to get too much over top.. even too much unrealistic than it already was but we were still diggning...
like him getting revenge for the dog was alrighjt, everybody was rooting for him for sure... but then.. it lost its purpose..and then this movie .. dude, come on, why 3 if it was that easy.. i mean, it wasnt easy but it the possibility of the duel existed in the first place? And how conveniently this marquis was hiding in a corner waiting for his turn to appear... kinda like the eternals during the whole Thanos event.. they said they couldnt interfere.. but wait, their whole purpose was to use Earth to do something I wont say for spoiler purpose.. but you know, made no sense than not helping the avengers... but anyway, this marquis and the duel should have happened in the movie before.. or not at all like i said lol..
could have gone with wick saving someone or whatever.. i dont know..imho, he is still alive but I imagine there wont be another one... unless this movie gets $$$$$ worlwide box office and then maybe.","5/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","hectordanielbuelna","25 March 2023","After the pleasant success John Wick was, the creators somehow managed to made their magnum opus John Wick 2, the best one by far, where the whole idea of the unstoppable legendary assassin gets fully realized.In this movie, however, just like in the last one they tried making the action more bombastic by giving the villain ""all the power in the world"", not only overcomplicating the whole lore of the assasins guilt (once again) but also turning the whole action of the movie into a cartoonish mess.Once again the Baba Yaga gets turned into a damage sponge who keeps just walking off been thrown off high buildings, getting run over, punched and hit with multiple objects and still winning every fight by the power of deus ex machina.The pacing of the action is just horrible, every 5 minutes there's a random fight and Wick keeps barely making it out alive but they keep expecting you take this crap seriously! Forget how awesome and practical gun-fu was in the first film, this time everyone has magical bullet proof clothing that just makes the fights longer and the whole choreography less believable.There are a couple of great cinematic and tense scenes (I specifically loved the sword fight NOT involving Wick and the scene where the camera is on the ceiling inside the abandoned building). Sadly there's a ton of things I hated: the almos 3 hour duration, the whole retcon and rush to stablish a new villain, the weak motivations gor said villain, the blind guy with superpowers, the needless ""tracker"" guy and his dog, the amount of random and long fighting scenes that just kept going and kept happening... So bad.","4/10"

And I was so disappointed.The movie is so drawn out and it's just doesn't make sense to me - there wasn't any clear intention for any character's actions - like why Nobody and Caine kept changing his mind over whether he should kill Wick or not? The killing over time just became repetitive - Wick just got away with many falls and attacked with virtually no harm at all. Many many more plot holes made this movie a pain to watch.And then I read that Chapter 4 is the only movie not written by the original screenwriter. And then it made all the sense in the world.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Andrewmcal","11 June 2023","Talentless writers ruin another film! I thought John Wick 3 was a huge disappointment, but John Wick 4 maybe the dullest action film ever.Keanu Reeves is a national treasure, but his heart wasn't in this one and it showed. Almost 60 and looking about 35, he punches and shoots his way through the baddies. But, without a script of worth to give his actions meaning, everything he does seems empty and flat. I fell asleep during one of the later action scenes to give you context on just how uninteresting the action in this film came across. Which is a shame, because I'm sure a bunch of people put a ton of work into it. But, if your fight scenes are inspiring me to grab a nap, what the hell?All the actors turned in quality performances. And, it was wonderful to see Clancy Brown again. But, the screenplay couldn't be saved. It was lazy, flat, and highlighted the lack of skill and imagination of the films writers. Shay Hatten is no Derek Kolstad!Visually it was very pretty, but it was the cinematic version of plastic fruit. If you haven't invested your time in the other films, give it a miss. It's not even worth watching as background for cooking.If the makers of John Wick: Chapter 4 read this, I want my money and time back!","9/10"

This movie trashes it completely and does away with respected conventions. In no world does this movie need to exist, but if it does, it needs to be tighter, and with better direction for the cast.Most of our enjoyment came from Donnie Yen's performance., and each time Ian McShane opened his mouth enough to show us his ridiculous veneers.","6/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Boristhemoggy","24 May 2023","I remember watching the Matrix series films and thinking the sheer silly volume of attackers all at once, and yet Neo manages to overcome them all. Some of the scenes were well choreographed, but by Matrix 3 I was fast forwarding through scenes as it was the same blocking, throwing, shooting of people repeated over and over. It got to the point where it was overkill if you'll pardon the pun.With John Wick 3 I said the same thing. There's one thing being John Rambo, but at least it was believable, at a stretch.Neo and John Wick are both unbelievable and frankly beginning to be boring. They're all just the same.I watched this one as I hoped for something a bit better but all it is is violence, errors, continuity problems and ridiculous scenarios.It's mildly entertaining I think because the acting is mostly OK and production values are high. But as an action film it leaves an awful lot to be desired.","3/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","capitanotm","24 March 2023","I am a big big John Wick fan. When i first saw it i was in love with the character and the idea and the freshness it brought to the table of action genre.We spend few last days before movie arrived in high expectations and when we saw 9/10 rating on imdb we were like this will be HUGE! Couldn't wait to watch, since we really liked all the previous ones.First three movies were amazing, they were progressing well, John had deeper and deeper character build, as did other character get, everything went very very good. First three movies were 8-8.5 even 9 at some points.This one was crazy downfall. I can see everyday rating is getting lower and lower and i guess someone payed a ton of people to write similar fake ratings to build momentum until it does what i now think it is made for - make as much money as possible.Nonsense, unrealistic scenes that went stupid, fighting which felt like they are preparing and training for real scenes to be taken, completely brainless involvement of blind man as an ultra killer who as it points in the movie is better than John himself.I mean i can write real real long text about dozens and dozens problems with this movie. We are supposed to have some fantasy level of skills here, but just some level, a believable level, this went way beyond even strongest superheroes strength level at some points and i am not kidding! Its ridiculous!!!Main villain is nonsense, its just so illogical in this universe. I was really really hoping that they can explore that Arabic part of the universe, fighting the Elders stronger snd stronger Elders, really exploring that mysterious part of universe, but no, he kills Elders like they are nothing, and then his main villain becomes young childish egomaniac that basically has no skills and no one knows how or why he reaches ultimate position at the Table. Crazy!!!Ending is rushed as many parts of the movie, and feels utterly disappointing and unsatisfying, only good thing to some degree is scenes with Scott ""unrecognizable"" Adkins.Keanu seems were off for the whole movie, like he has no energy, and he does more than superheroes do in this one, its just cringe after cringe after cringe. Disgusting what they did with movie and character!To all John Wick fans who waited this so long and were si excited to see it.. you don't need to. Definitely not paying for it in cinemas! Stick to the first three movies and make some happy ending in your head. This is EPIC FAIL.","3/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","blackknight-51234","4 November 2023","If you enjoy watching other people play video games then you'll definitely enjoy this.There's lots of action, weapons and style - all the things we've come to expect from a John Wick film.Of course it's ridiculous - all of them are. The mere idea that you can deflect bullets with a jacket lapel gives you an indication of how far from reality this film is. Keanu Reeves sustains what would be critical injuries half a dozen times - and shakes it off without any ill effects.With one exception, the amount of damage a character can sustain appears to be directly related to how important they are to the story. Most of the victims in the extensive gun battles (at one point it appears Keanu Reeves is single-handedly depopulating Paris) are gone after a couple of shots. If you have a speaking part then you can take much more damage than any of the extras.The whole idea of the ""secret assassin society"" only works if you don't draw attention to yourself"". So having a full blown Blackwater Contracting reunion at the Arc de Triumph isn't exactly the best way of keeping things on the down low.Throw in a Mr Chow-esque (from the hangover) character and then deciding to make him blind really shows how silly things have got. Last time I checked, gunfighting requires you to be able to at least the person you want to shoot. That said, he is at least still more convincing than Ruby Rose was.The first John Wick film was such a hit because the audience felt a connection with his loss and wanted him to be successful seeking revenge on what were some nasty (if ineffective) bad guys. At this point I'm not really sure what John Wick is supposed to be fighting for. He just lurches from one noir styled location to the next before embarking on an unrestrained killing spree, leaving dozens dead in his wake - you wonder if these people have families.If you liked the second and/or third film, then you'll like this. It requires little to no thought and the plot is as by the numbers as you'd expect.That said, the action, although resembling a video game, is very well shot, there's lots of cool locations and stylish outfits. Despite the tactical nonsense and the fact that the bad guys wait in line for their turn to attack him, Keanu Reeves has genuine skill in martial arts and pistol shooting.It's as constructive a use of time as playing 3 hours of Call Of Duty in your best suit.","5/10"

How is it that their suits deflect bullets but they get hurt so bad by nunchuck? Don't tell me it's because they're hit on the head. They were hit on the arm and the back and still got hurt more than gunshots. I'm assuming that's supposed to be comedy? I wasn't sure as it wasn't clear.In 2nd or 3rd one they said once the ticket is torn, there's no way back but now it turns out it's really easy to get back? Just had to kill a guy? I liked the first John Wick because the story was simple. But now the story is just stupid.I guess the appeal is all the action scenes but they're soooo repetitive that it really gets boring. Especially if you watch all 4 in a row. No, I didn't binge all 4 in a row but watched 1 per weekend because my daughter didn't see the first 3 and wanted to watch the 4th.

JW2 was pretty good though, albeit ridiculous and farfetched.. 3 was ok, but felt like much of the same. Now just watching 4 I'm literally bored.. and I love martial arts, guns, tactical training and Japanese culture.. All this ""round table"" ho-ha is bonkers and Keanu as much as I love the guy is clearly slowing down a lot now whilst enemy's around him do that real obvious dance that makes them appear like they're attacking to the best of their ability but in reality they're just making movement and waiting their turn to be blitzed one by one. The filming style too feels overdone and old. Like watching Matrix now in 2023 and seeing the fight scenes look like something straight out of a WB studio drenched in PG infused unrealism, JW has suffered much the same fate.. although both the Matrix and JW were once mind blowing pieces of art, now they're both like stale bread..","4/10"

1. JW suit appears to be a tank armor, if you forget any physics law and has no idea what a gun is, ok, otherwise even Rambo movies are more realistic.2. The Table has all the best assassins in the world and a blind guy is able to kill everyone without being shot. Seriously?3. Every enemy when hit once by a car dies, except for JW which is hit by I don't know, more than 20 cars and keep walking normally... hey, what? ""God-mode on""
4. Hundreds of people shoot JW but he is not hit even once! Not in the head, not in the hand which he uses to hold the suit, not anywhere...
5. When shots are being taken, the bullets make metal noise when hitting the suit... so, is the suit made of metal? If that was true, it would have no malleability, he would walk like Robocop.I found it to be a really bad movie because it became too unrealistic. If you don't mind about reality and just wanna see someone in a suit shooting tons of people, you will probably like it.","1/10"

Then that very annoying man with the dog, what was that all about, waiting for the reward to get high enough it was 20 million for Christ sake. I was so let down the fights were repetative, went on to long, and just became comical you can't take that much punishment and just walk away. The car fight in the Arc De Triomphe was different but again just stupid, no police, no one stopped everyone just carried on etc. It was like watching a arcade game with all weapons and you can't die. Then the warriors rip off near the end with the radio announcer? The first two John wicks were good, different, Halle Berry spoiled the third for me.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","info-72714","24 April 2023","After three previous films, in which the story, the action and the humor formed a unity, this farewell film feels superfluous.I will not fully describe the film, but after an 'Indiana Jones' (how this one is missed) opening, the film already collapses.There are hardly any humorous dialogues, but identical fighting scenes plague your eyes for 2.40 hours.It's impossible to keep watching seriously if all the characters just keep fighting after being fired at at close range several times.You have to dream along with a movie and not take everything seriously, but when the hero is constantly hit by cars and thrown down stairs countless times, it starts to look like a cartoon.Of course, I like Keanu and even look back at the earlier parts (particularly 1 and 2) with great pleasure, but this is expensive shoddy work. The fumbling with the nunchuks hurt my eyes: any 10-year-old child does this better.In short: Keanu played his imperturbable character properly, but simply fell victim to poor direction and a meager story.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","nigepitz","24 May 2023","JW4 has received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike but that's a mystery to me. JW1 introduced us to the world of the Continental, JW himself was tough but vulnerable and funny and the fight scenes were like nothing we'd seen before. It still had one foot in reality.But from JW2 onwards Mr Wick has become indestructible, an unkillable superhero with magical powers. Sure there were some good moments in 2 and 3 and some wonderful choreography but for me, everything that made the first instalment so amazing is missing from JW4. The humour has gone and many of the set piece fights look like they were shot during rehearsals when they were being practiced at half speed. You can see the stunt men waiting for their cue to attack. Worst of all though, it's boring. I had to turn it off and go back to it the next day. The bullet proof suits are ridiculous and reminded me of the missteps of the Bond franchise before the Craig reboot - (invisible car?) Keananunu is obviously older now and can't throw himself around like he could back in the day and maybe this is one of the problems. The biggest though is that when the protagonist is indestructible there is no jeopardy so therefore no interest.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","lonestaradvent","7 April 2023","I'm quite baffled at how good this movie was rated. I'm certain it is mostly the crew and their family/friends that upvoted this garbage.What was wrong with this film:Plot: the plot, like in most action films, is paper thin. Like most other reviewers have stated, you forget why he's doing what he's doing. This film had NOTHING to do with the first three, which is part of the reason of the success of the franchise. Nothing from the 3rd film was answered in this 4th rendition. What happend with Winston and Keanu from JW3? Why was nothing talked about. It's almost like writers retconned that whole scenario and it detracted from the movie. In the beginning of the film, JW kills the guy who heads the table. Kinda pointless, this should've been the climax of the film.The rest of the plot involved him going to random places to do random things, with action embodying the pacing throughout the film. His motivation was non-existent. If this was supposed to be the final film, why didn't Wick go after the bosses that have spots in the High Table? Why was he chasing after, or getting chased after by, the Marquis. The guy was a small fry compared to the High Table.The comedy was terrible as was the delivery. I was confounded in the theatre when people laughed at the ""dog bites nuts"" bit. We saw that JW3 with better taste.Acting/Characters: The acting is legit garbage. From Neo to Morpheus. It was over the top, and it looked like Neo learned his lines that day. Keanu's delivery was painful to witness. I was embarrassed I paid for the premium seating to watch this movie. Winston and Morpheus didn't care about this film and it showed. They would say a few lines then poof, disappear from the movie. This killed what little pacing the movie displayed outside of the action scenes.Although the film tried to make you care about the new comers, it failed miserably. There was no character development, just bits and pieces of information for the viewer to piece together to understand why they were placed in the film. The guy with the dog was a pointless addition. The antagonist was pointless as well.The blind warrior has been done to death, and JW4 defiled the grave. We don't care about him because he's a pointless addition to the movie to showcase ""eastern"" style fighting. He offers nothing to the plot. We don't care about his backstory, but we're forced to view it, because it's apparent he and that hot Japanese chick will be back in the 5th movie or the series.The Action: it was comical and sad. Keanu just can't do what he did 3 or 4 years ago and it shows with every fight scene he's in. If you actually paid attention to the moves that the other actors performed while fighting with Keanu, you can see where they wait for him to perform his set, and join the dance accordingly. It was painful to watch Keanu try to do the outlandish moves that he performed in the first 3 entries of this series. Every time he was in a fight scene, his sluggish movements just took me out of the movie and made me impatient.The Setting:
Part of the success of this franchise is how the setting was ever widening with each new movie. The first movie we got a glimpse of his time with the Russian Mafia. The second movie we see there is an intricate web of different crime bosses that have formed a collective of control on a world wide scale. The third movie furthered this notion of world wide control as John seeks the man above the table to redeem his life.The fourth movie did nothing to help evolve the setting. Sure we see a lot of nice prints of different locations, but what does that have to do with the overall arc of the franchise? Nothing. We're taken to different locations for arbitrary reasons and the director expects the audience to oh and ah over the cinematography.The Realism:
Going into an action film, I think we, as an audience, understand that reality is loosely based. This film took it to another level. The director and writers rip us out of the movie when John falls 4 stories and walks it off, gets hit by 5 cars going at least 30+ mph and gets up to dust off his coat, and falls down over 200+ STONE stairs and cracks his back to start his ascend in the final act.What Hollywood doesn't realize is that in order for this kind of fantasy to work, it has to be within a certain genre of film or literature. Just like I wouldn't want to see Harry Potter doing some Calc problems, because magical fantasy ya know? I expect John to be hurt at some point when surviving bone shattering and organ expoding injuries.Overall, this film sucked from start to finish. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either: Someone who worked on the film, a family/friend, a cringe fanboi, or someone who worships Keanu cuz he's a nice guy irl.","8/10"

Keanu fights like a 56-year-old man.

Its like the producers solicited every action idea from anyone and put it in the film but at the cost of things like dialog and plot.The video game crowd will undoubtedly love this film and it does have some beautiful cinematography and effects. It was fun seeing Donnie Yen playing the anti-hero as well. But it all fell flat after a promising start. After a while I felt like I was watching my kid play video games and I hate watching my kid play video games.The movie made poor cinematic quotes of other movies. The DJ and Plymouth Cuda - Vanishing Point. The DJ and assassins - Warriors. There was a nod to the Matrix as well. You get the idea. But they were poorly conceived and some so vague that they added nothing to the film. At one point I'm pretty sure the movie started quoting itself.John Wick was a cartoon of his former self. The Marquis said it best when he said that the entire idea of John Wick must be eliminated as well as everything he touched. Well, congratulations movie. You've done just that. I hung in to see how it ended. It could have been great and a fitting end to a great franchise but instead we got a beautiful video game. Don't press reset. This one is dead. Enough Already.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Lennie_G","1 October 2023","At the time I write this there have been 279.901 ratings for John Wick:Chapter 4. The vast majority of those must have been ratings by lazy 13 and 14 year olds. The kind of kids that are failing in school. The kind who are spending their time watching hack em' up movies like this and playing Call of Duty or other violent video games. The kind of kids that won't go to the effort of writing a review. In their defense, they probably couldn't find enough positive remarks to say about the movie other that ""it's cool"". There's perhaps a few who have gotten enough vicarious thrills and can't wait to buy a semi-automatic rifle. Not the kind to have fathers at home willing to teach them how to handle guns and when to use them.The movie itself is a mindless non-interactive video of long fight scenes in which the characters fight after they should have been killed or disabled by nunchucks, swords or pistols. It is a continuous blood bath with a muddled plot and no humor. When our civilization is unearthed in a thousand years and if a copy of this movie is recovered, the historians could only conclude the we were destroyed from within and a strong contributing factor were mindless and violent entertainment like this.If you haven't yet seen it...don't.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","athanasiosze","24 July 2023","I can understand the reasons why many people didn't like it. Some times it feels like a video game. John Wick seems like a superhero and it's unrealistic as a movie can be.However, this was always the case, regarding this franchise. JOHN WICK franchise is not THE RAID, neither the first RAMBO. Stahelski is not Gareth Evans. These are action movies that don't take themselves too seriously. This was obvious from the start. Not action comedy movies of course. (There was always an offbeat comedy element though, remember the third movie, even Boban Marianovic was one of the bad guys). Just action movies who don't want to be realistic or convincing. Just fun and a bit of ""Style over Substance"".In this regard, JOHN WICK 4 is the most ""Johnwick-y"" of the entire franchise. Relentless killings and action and some of the greatest action scenes i have watched in years. The scenes in Italy were amazing with all those cars playing a vital role. This is a cinematographic achievement. I don't know how they pull it but even the CGI scenes seemed authentic to me.In conclusion, this is the definition of entertainment. Of course, these characters are not human beings anymore, they don't talk like real humans, they don't act like real humans. They are Symbols. Stereotypes. Shadows. Of course the night club scene -- in which people are dancing whereas other people are killing each other in front of them-- is not realistic. Nothing is real here. John Wick is not a real person but a metaphor. Like poking fun at his own character, playing it with a straight face though.I could watch another 3 hours.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","gradd-67422","3 June 2023","I m beginning to believe that all those high rated reviews are either planted or submitted by underaged people or uneducated boomers. Especially those who call this a potentially best action movie ever must certainly be off the reservation.The film is literally a longer copied version (2h49m) of the previous 3. Theres nothing new with the characters, no new exploration, no arcs, no development. Just more double crossing and more of the same action scenes that we ve seen in the previous 3 films. If John Wick killed 500 enemies in this film, 250 of them died in the classic MMA-->Reload pistol--->Shoot them in the head style. We ve seen this move being repeated again and again and again since the 1st installment and now they are shoving it into our faces for almost 3 hours.If we wanna talk basic, just basic, realism, well... then lets talk about the complete absence of any form of police force while there is a ground war happening under the Arc of Triumph, or the church stairs.John Wick is getting an armored suit upgrade every film. Tony Stark would be jealous and probably would steal the design for his ""learn from my mistakes"" theme. Wick falls off buildings, luckily theres just one car under the building and Wick happens to jump right at the spot where that one car is parked, but even then from that height, half of his body should have been broken. Guess his armored suit is from Vibranium and absorbs kinetic energy and all types of vibrations.Obviously his enemies are all baboons on easy mode who cant even shoot a target dummy at 2 meters, but given the state of bulletproof armors in the film, his enemies decide to use Dragon's Breath rounds so that Wick can loot them off their corpse like a Call of Duty protagonist to counter the amount of armored enemies he encounters.I honestly could write 20 more paragraphs with all the negative parts of this film, but i think i wrote enough. The only reason i m rating this as 3 and not 1, is because in the very little amount of time that Mr. Keanu Reeves got to actually act as John Wick, he managed to maintain his unique calm and chill persona throughout two and a half hours of fighting and shooting, pain and bleeding.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","michaelquinn1966","2 June 2023","I'll preface this review by stating I loved the first three John Wick films especially the first one and was very much looking forward to number four.The premise ""too much of a good thing, can be a bad thing"" very much applies to JW chapter 4. What a way to decimate a franchise. This latest instalment was three hours of the same fighting scenes redone time and time again only difference a new city, three hours of a nonsensical story that just made nonsense and was basically just recycling scenes from the first 3 films.An hour or so into this film I was ready to quit, it was just mind numbingly boring and ridiculousA Blind Assasin - who can't detect a person five feet in from of them but manages to defeat anyone who came his way
Halle Berry looking really rough and minus a dog, what was the point of this character
A $20 million open contract on John Wick, yet he moves around the world unhindered until they basically redo the first 15 mins of the third film but in Paris when all of a sudden they need yet more fighting scenes
A ridiculous and pointless omage to ""The 1979 Warriors movie"". Broadcasting over radio to French gangsters and Assasins in English.............. wtf üò¨I could go on and on with everything that was wrong with this film but let's get to the good points
.............................
There isn't a single one, this is just a terrible, terrible film and would have been a horrible way to end the franchise if news of a fifth film entering production and I can only imagine how bad that is going to be.So ignore all these high mark reviews as they are quite simply lying and watch this train wreck at your own peril.","5/10"

This movie was a bore.This review was made in the month of April the 14th in the year 2023. In century 21st.What was this movie about?: Honestly I can't remember what the last 3 were about. I know I enjoyed them.This one was about people being tortured by the dog.John Wick plays fugitive but with many gun battles.The story and the production overview: It was boring. The only deeming quality was the Asian Daredevil. Wick got whoop throughout the movie.The Kraven the hunter character was one of those mixed unsure characters. He behaves one way then the other.I hated his dog. Kraven the Hunter was a dognutter in this.The dog being unphased after slamming into a vehicle was hash.The pitbull at the end was unnecessary to have in the movie. The movie was more about dogs than having a good movie.Genre: Fightin/shooting/secret society
Soundtrack: mix it was fine.Duration: 2 long hour of enduring a worthless mutt.UnHighlight: the dog. Very cringe.Highlight: Asian DaredevilWhat can be learned?: well watching serious movie was a good change from the comedic MCU films.Seems like serious movies are on the edge of extinction.Verdict: I was bored and wanted to sleep.","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","membermq","7 June 2023","John Wick 1 had a purpose. The second could be a good sequel. Then thrid was just a whole bunch of silly fight and shooting with people wearing bulletproof suits so they protect their faces with their jaket, they take bullet on the legs, arms etc. Keep fighting and shooting. But a knife can easily go through! What a joke.The Chapter 4 is really the dumbest of all. There is hardly any intelligent structure on that movie. Just fight with swords, guns, knives etc. And guess what? Same suits!I don't konw how many gunshots were fired during the making of this film.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","jjgurd","30 June 2023","Where to start. The director clearly decided the action needed to be nonsensical and implausible. The lazy rip off of the Warriors narrator style hunt, even copying it's 'boppers' epithet, was pathetic. It lacks the style and charm of Warriors.I tried to like this. I was a big fan of the John Wick series until 3 which started to run out of plot ideas but this is a stretch too far. The Marquis character is laughably lame, just a cliche rich boy with a trumped up ego (not to mention the poor French accent - just use a French actor!).This film should have been 1h30, they really had to work hard to get it to 2h40!

"John Wick: Chapter 4","supergye","14 April 2023","As a cinephile and decades of watching action movies, one is not as tantalized by the mere act of killing and car chases. What Wick 4 attempts to do is bring the action to another level on top of the prior 3. Not an easy task given the relentless killing and video game level of endurance the main character has. It is akin to the experience of watching Fast and Furious. We know no one could survive the falls and gun fights, and that is part of the fun. The audience is in on the joke sort of speaking. Dialogue is used sparingly. The mystery of the High Table, the almost religious codex that is followed by the criminal organization gives the movies a greater meaning than perhaps the sum of its parts. Reeves is a perfect fit, and we cheer for him as he appears to be the best most conscientious of the worst the org has.","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Anseldog","24 June 2023","Phew. I'm exhausted just thinking about this one.I very much enjoyed the previous three films, although admittedly by the third film the fights just didn't have that same impact and overall it was growing tedious, but I tuned in for this one cause my man Keanu deserves it.Sadly, the man gave it his all, but for the wrong movie. The first few films, the fight scenes felt fresh and new, if not quite reaching the levels of mastery displayed in the stupendous film THE RAID (which I feel this franchise owes a great deal of credit to) but by the fourth go around it all feels stale. And not to knock my man Keanu, but he looks tired. The acrobatics just didn't look fluid this time. Don't even get me started on the seemingly endless fight sequence in Japan. Wow - showed flashes of brilliance but when it lasts thirty minutes?? It was almost comical how interminable it felt.I'll give points for the continued showing of imagination fleshing out this world (although we all have to agree, the rules and lore are so confusing at this point that one can barely keep track of what's going on) as well as the wonderfully executed scene at the Arch de Triumph but the rest of this film just felt like a chore. And wow - could we have cut that video game baddie scene with the big fat card player? So lousy. Also - miscasting with the usually on point Skarsgard.Couldn't wait for it to be over, or for Keanu to put me out of my misery.","1/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","andreagrossi-69","2 June 2023","Seriously.This is a videogame. Lot of fight with a boss to defeat each time and the final boss.Nothing new, nothing that we haven't already seen. Some fights are so incredibly lame (opponents seems to goof around just to wait for the hero to get ready rather than attack and kick his ass into orbit) that they just not make sense. Or maybe the director think we the audience are all a bunch of stupid children.The first John Wick made sense. It was about a man who kicked some asses and got kicked for good.This one is more like one of the hundreds dumb superheroes (please.... The suit that deflect the projectiles is so utterly ridicolous that not even the excuses ""it's made out of kevlar"" can stand on its feet) that already are clogging the theatres and the tv on demand.We don't really need another one that turn a good idea, a good character and a potentially good franchise in a pile of fuming, smelly manure.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","okpilak","12 July 2023","It delivers everything one would want in a John Wick film. A very high body count, and very impressively staged fight scenes, and seeing the punishment he takes, you have to think ""boy that must really hurt."" And as usual John Wick leaves nothing to chance, as he makes sure the attacker is dead. So it is a high octane movie, with some of the usual characters, and this time John is fighting to leave the Table for good. So the stakes are very high. There is some lull between the attacks, but not a lot of time is wasted even though it is a long film. As entertainment, it fills the bill. And it doesn't pull punches.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Snownoise","25 March 2023","I wasn't interested in watching this movie because I knew what I'm going to get, but my friend told me that we've watched Chapter 3, and we've come this far, so we might as well just watch chapter 4. The result was just as I expected. It was just the same as Bullet train and other movies produced from the same production. Just another typical villains and typical fight scenes over and over. This John Wick production team or ""franchise"" has transitioned into a new Fast and Furious franchise making the same movies again and again by replacing cars and gimmicks. If they pivot and make some turns to adapt new ingredients that we've tasted from the first John Wick movie, then it would be still enjoyable, but it's too late to stop this ""cliche train"" starting from John Wick chapter 3, Nobody, Bullet Train, Violent night, and this John Wick: Chapter 4. I don't think this franchise will die any time soon. They are probably working another movies in John Wick universe right now.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","elviss111","23 October 2023","I love the Wick franchise and its approach to action packed movies. However, JW4 attempts to turn up everything to 11 and therefore fails to capture what is so special about the Wick franachise.While there are many points to be made about what was terribly wrong in this film, I would like to highlight three aspects that struck me the most. Firstly, the storyline is atrocious and makes no sense. Second, the fighting scenes are among the worst of the franchise. And third, the silly stylistic choices make you wonder if a child was in charge of making this stuff up.What a way to destroy what was so well built up in the first three movies. In the third chapter of John Wick, they build up the expectation that John Wick and the Bowery King are ready to go to war with the High Table and tear them down from their ivory castle. However, in this chapter, all Wick is doing is fighting against the High Table to achieve his freedom, and while he achieves this goal in the end, it has no effect on the High Table what so ever. One could even argue that because Wick died in the end, the whole fight was pointless. After four movies, the conclusion was that John can die a free man and a few ""important"" persons are dead. That's it. All the killing and pain for no tangible outcome. The High Table rests nearly unscathed and resuming business as usual. It feels like the studio realised the potential of the Wick universe and decided to write a different story that was originally intended. In addition, there were many illogical aspects about the story that made no sence. For example, there was no explanation why John had to go to Tokio and have another continental deconsecrated. Also, while the concept of a Marquis who is given all the power of the High Table is interesting, it feels like a cop out, so that the writers don't have to think too hard and write compelling and intricate stories about how the Table operates or what it consists of. Instead, we get a single face that serves the purpose of the High Table for the movie, and yet, is not really the High Table. All in all the story has too many flaws to be forgiven and makes the viewing very dissatisfactory.As for the fighting scenes, I understand that production has the need to turn up everything to 11 and make everything look cool or superhuman. But all that does is make the viewer go ""oh come on"" multiple times per fight. All the intricacy and realism that we have learned to expect from John Wick before went straight out the window. The fight scenes seem similar to previous movies but are so far and beyond unbelievable that it feels just stupid and disrespectful.And lastly, the stylistic choices that were made seem to be aimed at the younger population. The blind expert fighter, the lonely gunman with a dog sidekick, the mid-movie bossfight with a fat boss. The overall style of the Wick universe is very unique and intriguing but the attempt to amplify its style results in silly outcomes that are more offputting than intresting.As a huge John Wick fan, I am sad that Wick's story had to end on a low note. While the logical conclusion to this story, that Wick passes away after all the fighting is befitting, it is sad that he doesn't really accomplish anything with it. Rest in peace Wick. Hopefully your legacy will live on.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Thetruthhurts22","31 May 2023","The first John Wick was a masterpiece. They went down from there. Each one less than the last but still providing some Interesting plots and action.Now we have arrived at John Wick 4. Nothing is as good as the previous movies. The martial art action is far more Tae Kwon Do-ish than Ju-jutsu. Spinning kicks to the face? Come on. This is suppose to be somewhat realistic. The ""Gun-Fu"" is now boring and is so over done. The action is a pale imitation of the previous movies.The plot is ridiculous...without going into particulars it's just so silly.And although Reeves says about 15 words in 3 hours, his acting is so bad, it's hard to hear those 15 words.I realize this is all from the comic.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","roxlerookie","26 May 2023","I watched a 3h headshot fest where john wick chooses to let himself die on the street after getting shot by a blind man .Several things bothered me. Mostly the script being appalling / cringe / bland.I'm French, yet the shootouts in Paris involve American muscle cars, random bad guys and lots of automatic guns. I would have liked to see something a bit more local / that'd ring more true.Why does JW need to fall from a 3-4 storey building, get hit / run over by 5 cars, and literally fall hundreds of stairs? It's Deadpool level of trauma, but he's meant to only be human. If he can withstand that, why does he die at the end from flesh wounds?Why pick Scott Adkins to actually act? I'm sure he's buddies with Chad (the director), but the guy can't act, and barely had fight scenes. It also made no sense his character would be such a good fighter.Why do we get such a lame, young villain? There are much, much better villains out there.Why have some of the action in Japan?I guess they wanted to film in Paris, so they made the villain French (I think?). Except he's Swedish, and just doesn't feel French at allDidn't we deserve anything fresh? We got a recycling of: Kevlar suits, black full body armors (but this time around they're not nearly as bulletproof?), swords, attack dogs, American muscle car scene, motorbike scene. I mean come on.And why is the man killing John blind? Did he need to be blind?Visually, it all looked very good. Nothing we haven't seen before, but very visually pretty, the lighting especially. The killing go so repetitive that they switched to full on video game mode with camera from above. It was kind of cool, but also very silly as it felt again like playing a video game on rookie mode.All in all, an extremely long movie despite zero character / story development, suffering from remarkably bad writing & casting. In a way I'm glad John died because I know i'd keep watching the sequels, like the F&F movies, and feeling dirty afterwards.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","danielcereto","27 May 2023","John Wick first movie was an authentic masterpiece. Action was pretty well executed, even credible, thanks to Mr Keanu Reeves work and an interesting script and great choreographies. So consequently, I was pretty excited about the 4th statement. Same director, Keanu, and one of my favorite martial arts actors: Mr Donnie Yen (If you don't know who is him I recommend to watch IP man movies), simply amazing.Anyway, what can go wrong with a great talented cast and a great director?... Almost everything.First, the action scenes are extremely long and unreal, even sometimes boring because the repetition of them. You know nobody can't kill John, from the beginning because of his new Marvel's anti bullet suit... Really?Second, the movie itself looks like a videogame or a superheroes movie. It has lost it's soul, any realistic or human scene. A shame. Watch the original again to know what I am talking about. To add, the script is inexistent. The most predictable one from the Saga.Last, it's great to include animals but sometimes it's embarrassing to watch several ultra unreal situations. I really love animals but stop making them superheroes, (watched Sisu too this week).So, overall, is it a bad movie? Not it's not. It's the just the John Weak's of the saga. Best again are the filmography, music and direction. Beautiful but empty.","2/10"

Nothing new and exciting. I should have just rewatched the older ones.I like the 'kill as many villains as possible' genre, but for 20 minutes straight, a bunch of bad guys were all killed in the same fashion. The movie was loud for the sake of being loud. I would bring earplugs.The acting does not really exist; The plot does not really exist. The movie became a lacuna of what it could have been.

And it becomes more and more bloated, borderline idiotic with every new introduction... did 5-year old wrote this ??Even the action scenes - the whole selling point of these movies became stale and just boring. Establishing that magical bulletproof suits exist - created the situation that most of people became impervious to bullets which forces characters to spend just to much time on every baddie (and there's a lot of them). And worse of all ... half of them tries to cover their faces with their jackets, looking like Bela Lugosi in his campy Dracula movies, lurking from behind his cape... which is so unintentionally funny that it breaks all tension of situation. And it would be incredibly easy to fix - just invent magical armour piercing bullets and set back to more grounded action scenes from first entry :/To put it bluntly - this movie is so boring, and so stupid, that it actively wastes your time. Even Keanu looks visibly tired of this .. but maybe it's just his age finally showing.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","RavenEffect666","30 September 2023","I don't see how this movie is rated as high as it is.... And I absolutely loved the first one. It started getting silly in 2 and 3 become overkill but this is something else...It's literally 3hrs of an unstoppable Wick just mowing through an endless amount of bad guys. It doesn't matter the weapon... swords, nunchucks, pencils, kung fu, ju-jit-su, cars, whatever. Wick is a master of absolutely everything. And no one can seem to kill him. They always attack him either one or two at a time, no one knows how to take a head shot and he's entirely bulletproof. The concept of the bulletproof suit was introduced in the 2nd one but it was explained how it was still painful and getting shot still seemed to have an effect. In this one, nothing. Just shoot someone with a rifle, shotgun, automatic fire, etc and they just hold up their suit coat with zero effect.With that being said, there absolutely is zero effect, Wick has god mode on. Nothing stops him. At all. High falls of two / three / four stories, nope. Jump out a window and slam into a car? Nope. Just gets up and walks away. Falls, bounces off a concrete ledge and slams on the ground? Nope, just gets up and continues on. Hit by multiple cars, no effect. Thrown down stairs, it's fine. What's the point of this movie if Wick can't die, at all.... There is no threat of the guy losing.Then with that being said even more... it's 3hrs. 3hrs of action scenes that drag on way too long with injuries you just start shaking your head at. 3hrs of complete nonsense. Honestly at the 45 minute mark, I was just shaking my head and annoyed there was over 2hrs left...I loved the first movie. But why they took this series in this direction is just mind blowing. It's honestly just as bad if not worse than the Fast and the Furious movies. And just like the F&TF movies, they just keep making them. The movie wasn't even out for two weeks before they announced 5.I honestly don't get the high rating. This movie was beyond ridiculous.","1/10"

I was waiting with great enthusiasm as the previous 3 were very good in my opinion. This is a pure abomination of a movie which should have been good. I gave it 1 star for some of the choreography in the fight scenes. You can not fire so many rounds in close quarter combat and not hit the target. The action scenes are ridiculous as they are not believable. When making an action movie the makers must learn to make it believable .Rounds will not bounce off cars or glass,don't get the hero or heroine to take out too many people at once. This is boring but don't take my word for it,watch it and see for yourself. When watching movies we all look at that them on different levels .I like to be immersed in at so it has to be believable,others like lots of action that is no where near believable but they love to see lots of fight scenes and if you are one of them and like the lead to be some sort of superhuman,then it's for you.

While I still see Keanu from the Bill and Ted franchise .. the way he talks and how he ""acts"" ... well if you've seen it once, you can't unsee it. That said, it does not take away anything from the action extravaganza that is going on in this. Actually that makes me want to revisit the other Wick movies and maybe re-rate them. Giving them a higher score.Also I have to admit, that even though Denzel is the better actor (no secret here), franchise wise Wick has totally obliterated the Equalizer franchise ... kind of like he obliterates his enemies as Wick. You may wonder why they even try .. I guess for our amusement. For those who are able to stomache all the violence that is of course.I did watch this on an Imax screen and let me tell you: violence never looked better. But also everything else. Be it dawn, sunrise and everything in between. There are many scenes and there are some quotes that should be inspirational too. Friendship means little when it's convenient ... that is some deep ... stuff right there.I don't think that the movie gives the viewer too many riddles when it comes to guessing where it all leads to. You also should not mind the fact that Keanu or rather Wick must have a bionic body ... or his suit actually is made of a material that shields his body ... well one or the other ... or you just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. It makes as much sense as driving cars into space (yes looking at you Fast and Furious franchise) ... but we do not watch these movies for logic and rhyme and reason. I'd hope the same applies to you.There are some really great visual stunts in Paris - and it looks like they shot them there. But CGI is so far ahead ... who really knows? It does look awesome though. And towards the end ... the action inside a house and the way it is shot ... the director is coming up with new stuff all the time.And for the first time ever (in a John Wick movie), there is an after credit scene ... so sit down and wait for it - even if it may not be entirely satisfactory ... then again, until the next one comes out (it surely must be announced soon, no matter how this ended), the ending here is also ... well you may not be entirely happy with it ... but happy is a word that is missing in Wicks dictionary anyway ... so there we go.Edit: I don't do pointers when I write reviews which leads to me forgetting stuff. Lance Reddick who recently passed away and will be missed, was obviously an integral part of the franchise. Many may know him from TV shows, such as Fringe, The Wire and many more. But apart from him and many recurring characters (those who survive that is), we get many Newcomers. Bill Skarsgard being the top villain - and he does a great accent! As does Scott Adkins - ja! And of course the excellent as always Donnie Yen! The action (choreography) is the star - but it doesn't hurt to have some great people in front of the camera too.","6/10"

Where to even start with this one. The story is repetitious. The characters are over played and predictable.There's nothing remotely realistic about this movie.I cannot fathom how anyone has given this a positive rating let alone 10/10 and calling it the best action movie ever.It's basically a child's video game where the character you play never dies no matter how many times they get shot, hit by a car, in a fight, fall down stairs etc.So so bad.","5/10"

Reminded me of all the bollywood films I've watched where they never die even when they're shot and after being stabbed repeatedly. This film could have been made in 1.5 hours or so where I would have enjoyed it more. Thank god I didn't pay to go to a cinema. Kept waiting for dual but of course had to kill a 101 people before it happened. Please don't make any more John wick films they are getting boring and no excitement.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","J0ESUFF","19 October 2023","As my title suggest this movie is WAY TOO LONG. There is just too much time filler and the action, although impressive, has gotten fatigued. The first one made sense, the second one I understood and the third one provided a nice opportunity to wrap the STORY but they didn't, instead it was more just a non stop choreography dance. The scene that really made start zoning out was when he's in a shootout with about 100 men in a club while people continue dancing around them completely unaffected by what's happening. Multiple times you can see a bad guy wait for John Wick to look at him before attacking, it's just getting old.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","olhpickering","30 May 2023","Spoiler alert.It's John Wick. You know what your in for and it looks good, and the action is good in places. But, long story short, there is no point in any of the events in this film happening. It also pretty much renders 2 and 3 null and void.Everything he did, going against the high table, trying to get out, is undone because he just dies. If he'd got killed at the start nothing would have been any different. He manages to get out from under the High table but just dies so why bother? Okay, you can listen to Reeves and the director waffle on about this and that but who cares?""For him to get his peace, or freedom, in a way... that was the reason to make the movie. It can't just be, 'Let's do another one'. It was really about death, or a way of dying. We were really inspired by the Hagakure.""Great, cheers Keanu.Another theme seems to be consequences and facing them... okay fine, other characters do keep pointing out that he's getting everyone killed with HIS actions and he is. But y'know, surely he'll redeem himself and achieve something. Nope.You could also argue that he sacrifices himself to save his friend and his daughter but again who cares about that? The daughter is in it for about 20 seconds (and is less of a character then John's car was in the first film) but nevertheless he helped them and that's a positive. Oh wait, the post credits scene it's going to make sure even that small spark of hope gets snuffed out.It's a mean spirited and cynical film, that relies far too much on magic kevlar suits to mask the paucity of new ideas (although the ""dragon breath"" scene is cool) and just leaves a sour taste, even though it didn't have to. There are so many narratively satisfying ways to kill off a main character but this managed to miss every single one of them.The first one is brilliant. Lightning in a bottle. Turning it into a franchise bloated it and then killed it stone dead.","6/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","PotassiumMan","10 April 2023","Intensely engaging, immensely satisfying and courageously anguished, this John Wick chapter delivers the goods and then some. It's a testament to the durable potency of a well-executed, non-formulaic action film. There's so much raw vitality here, that one will barely notice the running time.Keanu Reeves never loses his power or presence as the former hitman who once again faces an imposing army of antagonists and pursuers even as he plots his own course of payback. Although some action sequences can be a little protracted, in the end, they achieve lasting and memorable power on account of this director's knack for innovative camerawork.This time around, John Wick's globetrotting work puts him in the crosshairs of the Marquis Vincent de Gramont, a cold-blooded member of the High Table. Their rivalry becomes a fierce battle that is waged at first in Osaka then Berlin and then throughout the streets of Paris. It's an opulent, labyrinthine showdown that we don't get to see very often in action films. Lush, colorful settings adorn the violence and bloodshed, almost as if to have to the physical beauty bely the depravity and carnage taking place.Recommended to everyone, regardless of their preference or penchant for the action genre. Many modern action films are solely for action fans. This proves to be the exception.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Abfabbb","23 June 2023","I was very disappointed in JW-4 and stopped watching it half way through as it was tedious, repetitive and boring. Just hours of mumbled dialogue, dark interior sets and non-stop Ninja fighting. The fights went on for hours and they did not make sense as humans didn't seem to be killed by bullets or knives and there was no reasonable explanation for it---the bad guys were not all robots. The plot was murky and we already know that Keanu Reeves is a robotic, deadpan actor. I have no clue as to how this film got rated 7.9. Unless kids and teens, under 35 people love to watch gratuitous, meaningless, poorly acted violence.","3/10"

You'd have to be braindead to ignore all the ridiculous building-sized plot holes present in this film.Even the action scenes are ruined by over-the-top nonsense. They're rendered meaningless and ineffectual just by how long they go on and how high the body count is. Less would have been more for this movie.The scene where he gets kicked down the stairs and just keeps flinging himself down all of them even though he could easily stop himself might just be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a movie.The scenes with the ""blind"" guy who fights like he can obviously see is probably THE stupidest thing I've ever seen. It's really kind of a shame what this franchise devolved into. It's even less believable than superhero movies at this point. Even more of a shame is that the general public seems to be so mindless that this kind of drivel actually finds success. I'd be embarrassed to tell anyone that I actually enjoyed this.","10/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Bonobo13579","22 June 2023","The first John Wick was terrific. A real shot in the arm for the action film. Then the second and third films were pretty much repeats, but with each iteration the action becomes more dull, more tedious.This is more of the same; like a video game from the 1990s with each part of the film leading to a bigger 'boss' to defeat. But with none of the fun of a video game because you aren't playing, you're watching. And the outcome is pretty much obvious from the outset.The action scenes that were the highlight of the first film, have become the bits to fast forward as they are so repetitive. The only interest is how the story progresses. And that is a fatal mistake as the story is thin at best.Please just stop now.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","spotboyfilms","24 March 2023","Parabellum (part 3) was my favorite and as is the case in many sequels, hard to keep topping your last go- not in the case of the John Wick team. They keep figuring out ways to keep the story interesting, delivering on the action set pieces and adding to the lore in a very effective and stylish way. John Wick 4 was an absolute pleasure to watch. It was full of entertainment. Despite being almost 3 hours long, it does not have boring sections. The non-action scenes have interesting characters, drama and incredible production design. John Wick continues to raise its own bar. As in the previous entries, each action set piece is distinguished and powerful. This is one of those movies that must be watched on the big screen.","7/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Top_Dawg_Critic","24 March 2023","Still one of the best action films of the best action film franchise, but I can only give this one a 9/10 when the first three films all got 10/10's. The main reason is that for this one being the longest of them all, the plot had more holes and the random new characters lacked the background they needed.Throwing in Mr. Nobody was just dumb, as was his story. It was just too random and lazy, especially with all that extra runtime. Having all the opportunities to collect the bounty was just too easy and took away from all other more deserving assassins to collect, and more importantly, his reasons for not cashing in were just too unbelievable and ridiculous. Instead of introducing him as a new character, they should've capitalized more on Fishburne's character and involved him more in this film, instead of him being a delivery boy - that was just a huge let-down.And as much as I love all the action scenes - and they were the best and longest thus far, they just didn't feel as authentic as the action in all the precious films. In the three-hour runtime, there's maybe a 15-20 min story, the rest is overboard non-stop action that is mostly ridiculous - yes, still the best I've ever seen, and it will probably be a long time before that's topped, if ever, but so much of it with so little story, unbalanced the overall viewing experience. The current narrative barely constituted a two-hour film, let alone three hours. Nevertheless, still an amazing film, it's the writing that could've been better and more in abundance.","3/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Dar Star","24 June 2023","Nowhere in the same class of film that the first 2 were in. Those films had a decent plot and a story that was somewhat believable. The action was over the top, but not cartoonish like the last two films have been including this one. I mean the blind assassin might be the phoniest character in cinema history. Then you have the usual Hollywood 100lb supermodel who can beat up musclebound henchmen like nothing. The fighting is just so over the top, it's ridiculous. John Wick never gets hurt even when he is being shot at point blank range!!! The leader of the whole Table lives out in the middle of the Sahara Desert???? I mean the plot is just so dumb and contrived. Plus, as much as I love Keanu, I think he has definitely grown too old for this type of role. It is basically a 6.5 film that I bumped up to 7. The action is phony but watchable so a one time viewing is suitable.","10/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","henry8-3","8 April 2023","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) must find a way of outwitting The High Table and gaining his freedom. However, under the leadership of the arrogant and sadistic Marquis (Bill Skarsgard) a contract for $20M remains in place and the Marquis starts by seeking revenge on Winston for not killing Wick in JW3.There are simply no other films like the JW films. Basically Wick moves from one impossible scenario to another beating up and killing what must be 100+ baddies in this film. The trick with all this is the stunning, balletic way these scenes are put together - they are just so incredibly and beautifully designed and almost hypnotic to watch - there is scene where you watch Wick move from room to room burning people up or shooting them and filmed from above - extraordinary. Wick is just the coolest character on screen since Frank Bullitt and he is well supported by Ian McShane, Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen and Skarsgard is a terrific bad guy.Whether there will be a 5th film remains to be seen - would be nice, the planet lives in hope.","3/10"

It is the fourth part that you have to spare your time, have patience and feel sorry for yourself that you are still watching. Part four does not have an interesting plot. It has no meaningful dealogues. The dealogues are like 2 weak minded people having a conversation. Just pointless. There are so many shootings and fights in the film that it's just boring to watch. You can't keep your attention on the endless gunfights and fight scenes. There are so many illogical places in the film that you start to get angry at the film. John is like some kind of superman. Maybe this is a Marvel movie? And I thought, on principle, if I watched this film not in the cinema but on home video. And I would get through all the action scenes and just watch the dialogue and the key scenes of the film and I wouldn't lose anything. And the film would last me about half an hour.

It's genuinely diabolical. Reeves is either carrying too many injuries or he's walking like he's got something unpleasant in his pants, the Marquis (dreadful French accent aside), walks like he's the one that put it there.Enemies come one at a time, hamming up the staggering and struggling to get off the floor once hit. Frantic grabbing for guns and other fighters, couldn't hit a cow's backside with a banjo, despite having automatic weapons. Wick sometimes is dead-eye, sometimes can't get his bullets to hit a target 3 feet in front of him.Most of his wooden opponents are just trying to get punched or drop their guns. None of them can swing a punch, even when practically invited.Oh and not even fancy Kevlar armoured suits would protect from the car crashes and falls from heights.And why kill someone with one head-shot when three will do?Frankly, the whole thing was ridiculous and Al the bs about the 'old rules' for the final duel!?! I doubt the 'old rules' included setting a bounty to try to stop a guy turning up at a duel.All a bit silly really. Barely even entertaining.","10/10"

I think the aspect I found most offensive, was the arm plates, which ALWAYS stopped incoming bullets, no matter what angle they were coming from, the caliber of the weapon, or any other scientific factor.This film was very poorly written. The sets, the cinematography, the lighting was spectacular. I only watched it for the production values, having tuned out this franchise after the 2nd film.The fight scenes were interminably long, and 100 levels beyond preposterous.

All in all, there is no plot itself for 90 minutes, let alone the 170 that they managed to stretch the film with endless scenes of fights and ""dodging"" bullets.After movies like this, everyone is surprised when the kids rush into the school with an automatic rifle, imagining that they are John Wick, ie alone against everyone in their numb drugged brains.I was expecting some kind of let's say grandiose film like the previous Chad Stahelski films about John Wick, but we got nothing from the former stuntman except a bunch of stunt scenes .... this film is just proof that some people should not be in the business of directing because they start to exaggerate.All in all, an average stunt movie that is worth watching only when you are very, very, very bored in life, and otherwise if you need to bathe the dog or clean strawberries from seeds, it is better to deal with that than to waste 3 hours of your life on this ""film"".","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","dakotadickenson-83457","25 March 2023","I never thought I would say this, but it's rare when a film executes everything it can to be just as good or if not better than it's past films in a franchise and John Wick: Chapter 4 does that in every single way possible. While every film in this franchise has been absolutely great, John Wick: Chapter 4 has changed the action genre in films as we know it, bringing everything it could possibly give us to the franchise and more. This movie had action and stunts that I never thought could be possible until viewing this movie and it did not disappoint. After taking a hard hit and recovering from the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum, Keanu Reeves returns once again as John Wick to take down any assassin that comes his way and put a end to the manhunt against him by challenging a lead member of the high table to a duel that will either earn him his freedom or could be the end of the Boogeyman. The antagonist in this film Marquis de Gramont played by Bill Skarsgard is absolutely menacing in this role, while bringing us not only a antagonist the franchise hasn't seen before, but also unlike any character Bill Skarsgard has played before. Out of all the newest cast members to come to this film, Donnie Yen was a absolute standout as Caine, a blind assassin and old acquaintance of John Wick's whose ordered by Marquis to hunt him down or suffer the consequences. Shimazu played by Hiroyuki Sanada I also thought was a great addition to the cast after seeing his performance in Bullet Train. The character I was not expecting to like that I thought was also a highlight of the film was Tracker played by Shamier Anderson. He was probably one of my favorite characters to come to the franchise and I hope we see him again in the John Wick Universe in the future. I was glad to see Lawrence Fishburne's Bowery King return as well as Ian McShane's Winston. I was also very happy to see Lance Reddick return one last time as Charon after his sudden passing right before the release of the film. He may of not have had a lot of screentime, but the last scene he was in I felt was closure for not only Lance Reddick, but his character as well. There is no doubt in my mind that this film will go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time. John Wick: Chapter 4 is hands down one of the most action packed I've ever seen, while also being one of the best I've seen in a long time that was made carefully with the end result being one of the best action film to be released in the past decade. Rating 10/10.","2/10"

Every actor in the film stands out and gets their fair share of screen time, bringing their A-game to the table and making each character a force to be reckoned with.The stunt work in John Wick Chapter 4 is incredible and the best ever put to film. The fight scenes are creative and thrilling; every single one is an absolute masterpiece. The creativity and attention to detail that went into choreographing these scenes are astonishing.

The film is so beautifully shot that it's hard not to be in awe. The lighting, the colours, and the camera angles all work together to create a stunning visual experience that will leave you breathless.The script of John Wick Chapter 4 is air-tight, and it's filled with fantastic quotable one-liners that will satisfy even the most hardcore old-school action fans.

It's unsurprising if these types of films overtake superhero movies as the box office's dominating genre.In conclusion, John Wick Chapter 4 is a must-see for any action movie fan. The film's impressive visuals, memorable characters, and incredible stunt work all contribute to making it one of the best action movies ever made and a contender for the best genre movie ever created.

Then just as John is leaving, more goons show up and the fight just starts all over again...I have very mixed feelings about this film as the effort and style oozes off the screen from beginning to end. Some of the performances were even really good between the action scenes. The cinematography can be incredible! The opening sequence and shots of the sunset are beautiful. But it all means nothing if there is no substance behind it.The film's length is another serious problem. It is unjustifiable. I've seen these movies compared to games in the past, and as an avid gamer, I've never understood the criticism until now.Everything about this movie is a video game in all the worst ways possible: Stretching out content by putting meaningless side content that could easily be cut for a more meaningful story, just added to include more repetitive gameplay sections. Bullet spongey enemies that always miss their shots and fall with little to no thought. A main character that could survive a nuclear explosion if he covers his head with his suit jacket??? Falling from 50 foot drops that instantly kill characters that are not the main character. Hell, the last movie at least made it seem like the fall damage he sustained at the end required him to rest and recover...I know this is meant to be a ridiculous fun rolllercoaster ride, but once you do one loop de loop having another 20 on same ride with no break in between does not sound like fun to me.The pacing of the action scenes in this film somehow manage to make the idea of a blind man with a sword in his cane, being able to snipe people using motion tracking doorbells incredibly boring.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","tomasmcnicholas-61237","4 February 2024","Huge Keanu fan. Liked the first John wick movie. Second and third? Ok. Fine. But this one was absolutely silly at times. Wick literally ran around in a Bullet proof Dracula suit. He looked almost as ridiculous as those cloned scrubs all running around with super short khaki pant legs (or were they tucked into super high boots?). Who really cares. They looked like clowns. John wick is apparently the human rubber man because he got thrown off a 15 foot balcony and face planted the concrete, jumped face first out of a two story building then slammed into a car below, got hit by no less then 10 cars, maybe a hundred fists and kicks, got shot at by 200 supposed highly trained assassins who apparently couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, then gets thrown down maybe 10 flights of a concrete staircase. All these things would have killed an effin navy seal yet John wick stands right back up, walks away and keeps on kicking AS_es! I literally laughed throughout this movie on how absurd it all was. Fight scenes were brutally bad. Like really bad slow motion. Bad guys were hanging back to give John wick time to catch his breath. I can't remember one scene where he was attacked simultaneously by more than one guy at the same time. The guy with the dog had his left hand literally cut in two yet it was just wrapped by a crappy bandage while using it defend himself with out even a whimper from him. Finally, they killed off John wick with a few bullets that literally just grazed him. Whoever wrote this garbage needs to be outed as a scrub and a hack.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","MattD12027","24 March 2023","I don't even know where to start. I love John Wick 1-3 and saw all three of them 2-3 times in theatres, with more repeat viewings at home.John Wick 4 is an awful mockery of everything that made the franchise good. It is far too long and overindulgent - some filler shots go on for 20-30 seconds when they could have been 5 - and the movie lacks the kinetic realism of all the previous entries. The acting is bad, the dialogue is bad and even unnecessary at times, and plot is completely nonsensical.WHY does he drive in circles around the Arc de Triomphe when he could just drive Montmarte? He later drives the motorcycle there...How is the Eiffel Tower the closest the Bowery King can get him to Montmarte? That's where he was right before that!!Ugh, and don't get me started on the Marquis nonsense. It's the worst kind of one-up-manship - illogical, unfounded, and a pure plot contrivance.Hard pass.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","philipstrong-07489","9 April 2023","I entered the cinema with great expectations I left with PTSD ... far too much shooting, violence and good old 'death', what happened to substance. I'm sure I actually saw John Wick shake at one point as if Mr Keanu Reeves was reacting to the constant chronic violence.The cinematography and music are strikingly very good at the beginning of the movie alas they fade to the norm as the movie continues. There is a great overhead scene, yes very violent set inside a building which I watch again.Ian McShane has a peach of a part where as Donnie Yen,Bill Skarsgard fill the movie with atmosphere.Sadly I wanted to give it a 10 but my ears are still ringing!","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","cherianams","6 June 2023","I expected more, he is killing and dodging bullets in all the versions of the movie. Over-hyped movie. Paris as a location is overhyped too. The story is poor and beurk. Actors are good. Writers can't come up with anything good.Black suits, guns, bullets, swords, fleeing boss villains some how get a boost and fight the actor toe to toe causing more injury that the henchmen.They couldn't live up to answer a lot of the vague information they mentioned themselves, the origin of the high table for example and the origin of the continentals.Garbage. I would/could say that an anime has better storyline compared to what we have in this movie.Don't watch it, you won't miss anything.","3/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","dizzymediainc","10 July 2023","It's pretty sad that this series went down the drain, the first 2 movies were really good but after that John Wick has started to decline with quality.Overall Chapter 4 is a huge disappointment, most of the movie revolves around characters we don't know and don't care about, the ones we do know barely have any screen time and dialogue, making me wonder why they even bothered showing them.From the first half hour i knew this wasn't going to be a good movie but i had hope it would get better, well by the end of the movie i was kicking myself for wasting 3 hours watching it.Sure there were a few cool moments and interesting plot points but few and far among the entirety of the film.Wicks dialogue was dull, short and pretty much pointless, he said almost nothing and when he did speak, it meant very little.The ending was extremely bad, all that struggle to what.. die on some stairs? Ridiculous.Don't waste our time with poorly made additions to an awesome series, spend the time and actually make good follow ups, not these quick turn out, let's cash in on the popularity follow ups that none of us Wick fans asked for.How people can even think this is ""one of the best action movies ever"" is beyond comprehension, you must not have watched actual good action movies haha thinking this pile of poop is actually good, oh brother.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","wargamesjoshua","28 March 2023","The entire plot of this movie was utterly meaningless. John Wick accomplishes absolutely nothing aside from getting all of his friends killed in his efforts to get away from the High Table, and all that sacrifice was meaningless in the end. From the way that the characters kept claiming that you can't change your nature, and how nothing meaningful changed in the end, I can only conclude that the pointlessness was the point.Should we try to better ourselves? No, says this movie. Should we try to better the world? No, you can't do that claims this movie.People, this movie claims, are nothing more than idiotic sheep that will just keep doing what they are doing, even as people are being brutally murdered right before their eyes. I remembered enjoying the first movie, but giving money to this disgusting piece of propaganda was a mistake.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","tommy-97761","6 May 2023","Sadly (for me) this is the first John Wick movie I've seen in the cinema. Had I gone to every each part, I might have understood the hype concerning the sequels sooner. This is surely an unpopular opinion, but the first movie allways felt pretty complete and satisfying as it was, with a clear goal, villain, action and worldbuilding. Though the sequels are full of awesome setpieces, modern action and more worldbuilding, it allways felt overly complicated. Well the fourth one made me understand. I still like the first movie the most, the experience of seeing this in the cinema just left me in glee for the entire runtime. I recognised action actors, stuntmen. The cinematography even during slow conversations is beautiful. The lighting, sets, music so stylistic. The action performed in choreographed long takes. Sometimes ridiculously long takes. The whole John Wick series is a loveletter to all stuntmen and action fans. An action movie done right, and the small screen does not do this series justice. You need to see those setpieces on a big screen and hear each bullet trough a propper sound system. Real locations, practical stunts, precise camera work, what more could you ask for? Of you still have a chamce to see this on the big screen, go and do it.","5/10"

Overloaded with fight sequences that were far too long and totally unbelievable you felt like you were in a video game with countless lives and bulletproof skin, yes he has a bulletproof suit but please we do have some intelligence.Disappointing nonsense of unbelievable magnitude, the director should be ashamed!","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","chrisjw-01026","10 April 2023","Despite not watching the previous John Wick movies, this was still amazing. I would say that it didn't have to be that long and there definitely could have been some small cuts at least.John Wick is all about the action and I like how they don't try to bs things too much like other action movies. The action scenes were one of a kind. Long and intense choreography over intesely fun music, mixed with the challenge of weapon/ride swapping, and even topped off with creative cinematography. The top down scene is the pinnacle of that. It was both intense and fun and something i've never seen before in an action movie. I couldnt help to smile at how mind blown I was for watching it.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","samirvolt","10 June 2023","This is the worst and last John Wick movie, and I can honestly say I am not biased. I liked the other three; even though they became progressively more unrealistic, and ridiculous. But this is definitely the worst film by far.Donnie Yen's acting is terrible. His lines and mannerisms are janky, and spastic. He's meant to come off as a funny blind character, but does not pull it off. He's no Blind Fury, or Zatoichi, and his fighting in the movie is not graceful but stilted and awkward.The movie itself is a boring slog. The entire film is one big death scene/fair well to John Wick's character, but it fails to pull off a satisfying ending and send off. John Wick dies from a gunshot to his lower left abdomen. This unkillable, magnificent bastard, the 'baba yaga' dies from a gunshot that probably just hit a kidney. Let me stress this; he does not get shot in the heart, or anywhere vital, he just expires at the end because the film needed him to.John Wick's unexpected surprise death aside, this movies action scenes are terribly boring. There is barely any violent humour except a dog biting peoples balls, which gets old fast. There's nothing new here; no new interesting ways in which Wick dispatches enemies. The other films at least had him kill someone with a book or something. Here Wick just falls from high places as usual, then gets hit by cars, as per usual, then gets up and walks it off, again; as usual.The film is chalked full of crappy fortune cookie statements and pseudo philosophical lines. And boy do they suck. Maybe Hollywood does need to pay these writers something, they don't seem to care anymore.None of the plot points are very interesting because its obvious stuff; for example there's no beating the table's top council, they just get replaced. And so the film tries (halfheartedly) to come up with a neat little solution; a duel between Wick and some French douche. A contrived dues ex duel with no real payoff. Wick dies for some new character and his daughter we don't even know. But don't worry, she plays a violin for 3 seconds, so we feel so much empathy for her...And Donnie Yen slurps up noodles in the shadows of a restaurant before we even see him do anything; so that's...relatable...I'm very disappointed in this movie; I really believe John Wick's character deserved better.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Rob-O-Cop","29 July 2023","I struggled to get through this movie. It took multiple tries over a few days. It was that tedious.The action scenes were initially impressively set up, but they dragged on for what seemed like forever, with no real point. Like watching over the shoulder of some 50 year old at an arcade game as he played a combat machine with updated graphics. Fun for him but considerably less fun for the people watching and not playing. Did I mention how much it dragged on? Almost 3 hours.... I was long and didn't have the content to keep it going.I do give credit for the myth and mystique of the world building, the layers of power, the tradition and honor amongst thieves and criminals, and I do like Keanu Reeves, and Ian McShane and some of the other actors a lot but you're left with the burning question - Why?Why are we subjecting ourselves to almost 3 hours of Reeves slaughtering people like he works in an an abattoir for humans.It was a show reel for the stunt and effects team, with impressive visuals and scenery but that doesn't make a good movie, that doesn't equate to entertainment, that doesn't justify wasting our time, and someone's money and resources.In a way it's a bullet to the head for the industry that makes this stuff, and let's face it much of Hollywood's output is based on this format. Senseless violence an brutality as entertainment. The weird thing is that this movie found the edge of people's tolerance for it through boredom. They made it boring so we now question why are we watching this stuff? Why are they wasting theirs and our time.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","eoinageary","12 July 2023","John Wick Chapter 4 comes with a bang! John wants to clear his name and be done with the table but the route of getting there this time is much harder a task than we have seen before.There are so many highlights of the movie, the action was all superb ! I already after first watch have a favourite which is hard to pick as there are some AMAZING sequences in the movie. I won't say the location because I want to give nothing away but I will say in Paris with a lot of traffic !This movie delves into the characters way more than before, we get really good time with the side characters, usually a movie like this would give them 10-15 minutes screen time and kill them while this isn't the case, in the time sense. We get motive, we get their struggle and really good interactions with John. My favourite side characters were Nobody, Shimazu, and Caine.John takes some hits, serious fall damage but these are the movies not real life hahaha. It's a spectacle on a grand scale.Very small nitpicks, the fights are all superb but I would like some more intimate fights for eg JW1, when they entered his house it felt more threatening, and that's it hahaha it's personal preference as a nitpick which is pretty darn good.JW4 is definitely the best of the sequels and up there with the first in my opinion! 9/10.","10/10"

And I have recently watched the three previous John Wick movies on video and I thought they were pretty good.Now comes the new movie ""John Wick Chapter Four"" and nothing could prepare me for how great this movie is.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","AvionPrince16","22 March 2023","I saw so many action movies even all the previous John Wick movies and i need to say that this movie put the standard pretty high. The sequences, the shots without a cut, the long sequences of fights was spectacular and really brutal. I enjoyed also the music during the fights and really put a nice rythm to the fights and give dynamics and nervosity. Also the set design from Osaka to Paris was gorgeous and had so many small details that i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen. We had also the story who introduced the new vilain who supposed to be French and was pretty convincing. We have also some interesting discoveries all along during the movie (the blind man who have his daughter in hostage, the way to put an end to all this and to recover the status of the guy in charge of the continental who get destroyed in the movie. The fights feel great even if we know that match a certain choregraphy and dont reflect a real fight but it was well made and have some interesting shots (when at the end they all tried to kill Wick in the building and the camera shot from above all the scene and transform it like a mini map). Some scenes really look gorgeous and awesome and like i said i saw so many action movies but this one was really different; even in the work of the lights and how they put the lights to create a certain tone. It was pretty effective and sometimes some scenes was pretty funny (with the dog). The end is pretty sad and thought that John Wick will made it trough all that but he died. The Caine Character have an interesting style: the way he fights, but i think it was not necessary to make him blind because some scenes lack of logic sometimes and questions us to the believable situations that dont feel believable sometimes(the fights, the fact that nobody had the idea to shot him in the head quickly)but it was ok and give a new opponent/friend to John Wick in this episode. Give it a try. The actions scenes (because its mostly an action movie)was pretty awesome (Arc de Triomphe, Osaka, sacr√© coeur). And make it memorable and its one of my favorite John Wick and maybe favorite action movies for now? But it was awesome really. And even some dialogues was well written and some meaningful moments. The story was good for an avtion movie but its certainly not the most interesting part in the movie for sure even if it have some interesting moments and revelations and surprises( i didnt expect the death of the concierge so quickly in the movie to be honest). A nice action movie. No doubt about it.","10/10"

It was like watching a replay of a video game where the opponent does not die till his life bar runs out after taking so many lethal hits. Just ridiculous!

"John Wick: Chapter 4","FortySecondStreetFreak","23 March 2023","At least this once fine franchise now has a (meh) ending. Tired, stupid, annoying. Only 1 great gunfight (a GLORIOUS top down, exploding shotgun shells, massacre) & 1 good hand-to-hand fight (with an unrecognisable #ScottAdkins), the rest of the action's dull, repetitive, silliness. #KeanuReeves (effective in the other 3 films) here gives a truly appalling performance. He sounds like his batteries are running out, every....word....is....emotionless. His opening scene might THE worst acting seen in cinema history...& he only says ""Yeah""!.
Where once Wick dodged damage by using his skills to not get hit (& we could genuinely see how he avoided it), now he just brushes off 'Superman' level damage (it's so ridiculous it gets genuinely annoying...from plummeting off buildings, to getting hit by multiple speeding cars, to smashing down 100's of stone steps) that makes EVERY fight pointless (who cares if he gets punched, when bone crushing falls literally do no damage)? Assassins suddenly either don't bother to shoot or punch him when they have a chance, or simply can't hit him even if when he's standing still! But who cares anyway right, when he's now seemingly made of Adamantium!?.
And why tediously rehash ""Rogue One"" by making #DonnieYen blind again? Worse, it just adds to the annoying stupidity. That a blind swordsman could hear his enemy move, or feel the air moving when a sword strikes, makes (a fantastical) sense. But how does a blind man dodge getting shot by multiple gunmen standing 20-30 feet away? Can he 'hear' the direction a gun is pointing? What utter nonsense. In fact he's so not effected by being blind...why make him blind?!.
There's also a sorry lack of links to the other 3 films. You could watch this & fully understand most of it. Bar Fishburne, Reddick & McShane no characters return & even the shocking betrayal by #IanMcShane in ""3"" (including shooting Wick off a building) is completely ignored by the plot AND Wick! He's just back to being a friend & ally again as if nothing happened. Hell, even the damn dog gets ignored!.
The fact is if ""3"" had a better final 3rd with a satisfying ending we would've had a truly great action franchise trilogy. As it is the entire bloated finale & garbage non-ending of ""3"" seemed to doom the franchise UNLESS a (money-grabbing) ""4"" could perform a miracle...But as we know, miracles rarely happen.Best just stick with ""1"" then now.","5/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","warren-87235","5 June 2023","The first John Wick was good fun. It's over-the-top, but enjoyable nonetheless. After the villains kill his puppy, being the last gift from his dying wife, we were provided with a great alternative to the usual motivation you get in such films.After that, JWII and JWIII became increasingly ridiculous. Even for films like this, there's a point at which 'absurd but fun' turns into 'so absurd it's no longer fun'.JW:IV is akin to watching someone else play a video game of the same repetitive thing, but also on 'god' mode with infinite stats, so you don't even have the fun of seeing the gamer's skill at play. It even looks and feels like a video game. The character is never injured beyond an 'ooh, I look tired' level, despite incidents that would have broken every bone in even a super-hero's body. You can shrug off one or two silly moments like that, but after the tenth or twentieth or thirtieth...The fight scenes are so long, so repetitive and have so little motivation, that you cease to care what's happening and genuinely feel like hitting fast forward. It's a bad sign when you want to fast forward through an action movie to get to the more interesting non-action moments.Ultimately, given that the character has had increasingly less and less motivation as each movie has progressed, we get to a point where the 'dramatic' conclusion leaves you cold. John Wick's motivation by this point is absolutely NOTHING, bar survival, so his 'sacrifice' ends up leaving you feeling that it was all pointless, especially considering the somewhat lacklustre villain. (Although I'm sure John will turn out to have survived for the next film anyway)A more interesting angle would have been teaming up with all his former allies to finally take down the 'high table'. Instead, we're treated to a shoulder-shrugging conclusion that was supposed to be dramatic and emotional but leaves you just not caring.It took two sittings to bother completing, but I'll give it a 5/10, because some of it is still well filmed and visually interesting, though mostly in the first hour.The films drop approximately a mark each time...JW:I - 8/10
JW:II - 7/10
JW:III - 6/10
JW:IV - 5/10 (being very generous)","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","kayleebatte","24 August 2023","This movie literally blows. We rented it from redbox and we got an hour in and couldn't believe that we still had an hour and 49 to go. We skipped to the end and it is something that could've been shortened. Keanu spoke sooo little, bad dialogue, bad fight scenes, and just overall unrealistic. I mean come on a blind man knowing when john wick looks at him and how to fight everyone??? Be so serious right now. The dialogue was drawn out and overstayed it's welcome. Fight scenes were TOO choreographed so they were very obviously fake. Every line Keanu had, he sounded like he was asking a question. It's the same story line as john wick 2&3. Too long. Too boring. Too played out. Don't recommend. I created an IMDB account just to leave this review that's how bad it was.","8/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Oh_Capital","3 April 2023","This is a classic case of style over substance. The settings and cinematography were pleasing to the eye, and the fight scenes were choreographed better than 90% of the other action flicks out there. The problem is I never cared about what was going on, who was dying, and how it was all gonna turn out for Baba Yaga.John definitely killed more men then words he said. It was mostly grunts and a couple of classic Keanu lines like ""I have to get back,"" monotone half sentences. But I suppose that is part of his charm. The point is the dialogue was terrible.I understand it's not an emotional drama so dialogue and plot are not at the top of the list, but could we not have gotten some decent story telling? It's just fight scene to fight scene. Oh well, John Wick is a fun time at the theater with your buddies and a couple of drinks, but be prepared to endure 3 hours of one big fight scene.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","ryanpethrow","19 March 2023","John Wick 4 picks up where the previous film left off, and it does not disappoint. Keanu Reeves returns to the titular character, John Wick, and once again delivers a breathtaking performance that is sure to leave fans in awe. However, this time around, Reeves is not the only one stealing the show. Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, and Lance Reddick join the cast, and their performances are nothing short of outstanding.Yen, a martial arts legend, brings his incredible skills to the movie and delivers some of the most brutal and cool action scenes in the film. Skarsg√•rd plays a new villain who is as menacing as he is unpredictable, and his scenes with Reeves are intense and thrilling. Reddick, who has been a fan favorite since the first movie, continues to shine as the enigmatic hotel manager, and his interactions with John Wick are as entertaining as ever.The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has been with the franchise since its inception, and he continues to showcase his expertise in creating thrilling and visually stunning action sequences.But it's not just the acting that makes John Wick 4 a standout action movie. The work of the stuntmen is absolutely incredible. The fight scenes are brutal and fast-paced, and the choreography is flawless. Every punch, kick, and gunshot feels real and impactful, and it's clear that a lot of time and effort went into perfecting each moment. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI is also noteworthy, as it makes the action feel more grounded and visceral.The supporting cast in John Wick 4 also deserves recognition for their performances. Halle Berry is a standout, and her character's relationship with John Wick adds an emotional layer to the movie. Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane, who both appeared in previous films, continue to deliver excellent performances, and their characters' interactions with John Wick are always a joy to watch.The music in John Wick 4 is yet another aspect that deserves praise. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard once again provide a score that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music builds tension and excitement, and it enhances the overall experience of watching the movie.Of course, as with any action movie, there are some flaws. The plot can be convoluted at times, and some of the characters' motivations may not be entirely clear. However, these issues are easily forgiven in light of the incredible action and performances.In conclusion, John Wick 4 is the ultimate action sequel. Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, and Lance Reddick all deliver outstanding performances, and the stunts, direction, and music all contribute to making this movie a must-see for action fans. The franchise continues to raise the bar for what an action movie can be, and John Wick 4 is no exception. If you're looking for a thrilling and entertaining ride, then don't miss this movie.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","olcare","22 March 2023","First of all, I went to the cinema as soon as it came out and I must say that it should never be watched outside of the cinema. It's an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching. Its really really good action movie.From a technical perspective, the film is phenomenal, especially the bird's-eye view scene. My mouth was wide open, it was amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the action. Every fight choreography was well thought out, yes, some parts were exaggerated, but it suited the pace very well. The staircase scene is the biggest example of making these long and single-shot action scenes aesthetic, and it's a great achievement.In terms of acting, I think it was very good. Even though Keanu Reeves played emotionless at times, this role suits him very well. Especially there is one name that fits perfectly, Bill Skarsg√•rd, he played amazingly and I loved it. Also, Killa, played by Scott Adkins, was amazing. It was one of the most entertaining scenes I've watched in a long time, even though the fight with John was a bit weird, it was fantastic. I watched it breathlessly. I won't mention everyone individually, but the performances were more than enough from the stunt doubles to the one-scene actors.It improves the action of the first 2 films and develops the lack of subject matter or subject matter presentation in the 3rd film, making a very aesthetic mix. They covered the biggest flaw in this series.Also, another good thing was the harmony of the music to the scenes, every music was perfectly fine, which I think increased the pleasure of the action scenes by a click or two.There is not much to say, it's a satisfying, exciting, and aesthetic film. Although it lacks emotionally at times, it never stands out and uses its time wonderfully. I loved the movie, and I highly recommend watching it in the cinema instead of waiting to watch it at home.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","qstufie","24 March 2023","If you enjoyed JW 1-3, you can't miss this one. It's the ultimate visual feast of blood, bullets and magic, yes magic, read on.It started with JW getting out of the situation alive (again) after falling off the top of hotel continental and continue to rid the world of fellow hitmen (yeah why were there no hitwemen, just wondering).Except that he gets a partner this time, no one else but Ip Man himself, or maybe Zatoichi, yeah more like Zatoichi with eyes can't see, and a cane sword (sword cane)? And aptly named 'Cane'. Except that Cane kills him at the end, anyway that's not important.What's important is, the action! The action is over the top (not that the first 3 wasn't over the top, but this time it's over the topmost of the previous tops), so normally JW uses the ground as his weapon, now he uses cars as well, and stairs.Damn I would hate these stairs, especially when you just finished climbing up 20 flights of stairs and got kicked back to the very begining of it. But they do act as effective weapons when you toss the body of your enemies on top the stairs.And the magic!First of all, the fantastic animal, this time, in a dog form, who listens to her emotional support companion (the tracer)'s commands, and acts accordingly. Honestly I think she needs anger management that's why she has an emotional support human for her.Then there's the weapon that shoots fireballs and light up anything they touch - just like in the games - yeah also top down view, reminds me of the orginal psx grand theft auto, but way more fancier. Heck even the ragdoll movements of the bodies were just so ... identical. I totally enjoyed that.That's 2 and half hours total enjoyment without a break - don't drink too much water before or during the movie and you can thank me later.Now, why only 8 points?Well, also the action - they must have changed the action director cos this time the enemies don't swarm JW anymore, they wait, like civialised citizens, they take turns to hit him, and only when the first one is down the second one will join, there was no rush at all. So yeah I have to take 2 stars off for that reason.Overall, very enjoyable and certainly will get the bluray when it comes out (yes I have the first 3 on 4k bluray).Don't let your kids watch it, they might get the wrong idea like wow I can be that strong and take on the world by myself.No son, you can't, you are more likely to get a bullet through your brain, don't try that.","9/10"

Come on. Really? How can this man be so skilled in hand to hand combat? How can he hit a target (John Wick) with a gun while standing 60 paces apart?And wow...the dance club scene...all that violence, fighting and gun shot happening and yet the crowd just keeps dancing as if they don't see nor hear any of it...at least not until the very end of the scene. THEN everyone begins to scream and run out. WTH??Suspension of disbelief is required for most movie viewing, but damn...this one just gets so ridiculous that it becomes laughable.And then in the end, John dies from multiple gun shots from a blind man. He deserves a much better farewell than that.Simply unbelievable that this script made it to the screen. The director should never work again in Hollywood again.","2/10"

I could keep going but...what's the point. Most people love it. Call it the best movie ever and so forth. I'm the minority in my review of this. I have the upmost respect for Mr. Reeves.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","rgkarim","24 March 2023","LIKESActing
-It's simplistic, it's extreme, and it's these characters that you love to just grip on to in the grand scheme of things.-And yet it all works together in this action heavy movie, to still create these elements that you love in this film to have a little more meat than some other films in the action genre.-I disagree with the top billing, but I have a trend so.-Georgiou is fine for the like three minutes in the film, and sadly his story does not have much merit to the film, so let's move on.-Ian McShane is excellent as Winston, cultured, classy, and though not the star, stealing the show in those moments with well-executed class, poise, and comedic delivery.Bill Skarsg√•rd is great in the villain role again. Not quite as dynamic, but captures his dad's intensity as the big baddy who causes a lot of trouble with ruthless efficiency.Donnie Yen is awesome in the action roles, and he has an incredible prowess in choreography and delivery to make him a stand up character in this universe, like Rogue One on adult steroids.Shamier Anderson is good for the times he's in, and that's all I can say to not give too much away. Quite, calculating, but gifted in the edge of this action series, he belongs well in this chapter and universe for many things.-Fisburne is fine for when he is on stage, he just needed more time, involvement and dare I say development that Chapter 3 and the commercial s promised.-As for Reeves, the man may not be the best actor, but he is awesome in terms of stunts, very blunt edges, comedic delivery (intentional and unintentional), and just that feeling by saying little. He struggles with, well some other things, but somehow it works given his character.The Story Building
-I've said it several times, but yeah, there is a bit more of the story in this one and much more character development than the past.-Wick's fourth chapter really starts to expand upon Wick's background, while opening up the facets of new characters and trying to help build more of the past.-It's endearing, it's deeper, and establishes layers to characters for books, and other media can expand upon if the movies ever dry up or won't go down the prequel path.-And this particular chapter has enough of the now moments to help things really engage and be intense to help Wick's story continue to expand into levels that just make you continue to root for this character.-Which leads to the next like.The Emotions Surprisingly
-This movie is emotional because it really pushes into those little divots from the past and extends them to more engaging character moments.-Chapter 4 uses the music, the footage, and the story to great levels and establishes moments that help ground the action and silence the action edge.-And it's extraordinarily balanced to the point that it only adds not takes away from the story, and gives stakes and care to the action sequences they designed.-Having such investments into this movie helps get past the usual stereotype of mindless action without much else, and if you are hooked to Keanu's character, you are in luck with this installment really polishing him up.The Special Effects
-You have to make this movie shine to capture the action and make it really shine in this world that makes ""action"" movies.-It works. Wick's scenes have the sound to capture and bring you into the mix. Bullets bouncing, clips discharging, swords clanging and explosions rattling with the music.-But the audio only goes so far if you don't have the visuals, and Wick's team has you covered there with tricks and trades that make the insanity come to life.-Amidst impressive sets, Wick has stellar visual effects as the extras go flying from the stunts as computer and reality combines to make believable bouts of death on the screen.-Flashes of guns, people falling back, blood, and reactions all work together and really make things that insane bout of action that I expected and love in this series.-And it's all captured with camera work and editing that doesn't get lost to shaky work, or that realistic found footage twist that annoys me with some action films. That works super well with me.The Action Sequences
-The heart of this movie, Wick is all about the action. Clocking in at roughly 88% of the movie by my calculations, Wick's longest film adds A LOT MORE action than I anticipated.-Simplistic at first, the movie evolves to add story elements to each fight, while also adding different styles to help diversify the profile , which I greatly appreciated.-Sword fights with physical moves and gunplay opens up at one point, and then we switch to different combats the next as the five sequences help add new styles to freshen things up.-And again it works with the emotion and the story to help add that stakes I like, alongside some of the justice filled finishes you love so much.Dislikes:Too late for this level of Storytelling
-Was the storytelling too late? In a sense for me, yes. Wick may not be known for the plot, but to take such strides and character development this late in the game might have been weaker to me.-These new relationships seem random. The history lost to the fast pace and stunts, that they don't have the full time to commit for me to be worth it.-Throw in the ploy to potentially capitalize on it further and well... it's not the worst, but it just didn't have the full meat I think they could have done.Some Plots Rushed
-The fast pace means the attempts to build plots is also very quick, this film trying to tie many elements from 1-3 into one film, which means lots of details to revisit.-Nostalgia wise, it worked for me, but these moments were very quick, and limber, again leading to a weaker story in my opinion.-For an action flick it's good, but for the legacy of Wick, it could have been better, and perhaps this is going to be a lead in to some spin off given the trend of Hollywood and streaming.Loud In My Showing
-I may sound old, but if you have sensitive ears, caution for the movie is very loud to the point it can be very distracting.-If you too are sensitive, just exercise caution so you don't injure anything.Still Some Level of Absurdity
-I know Wick is already extreme and absurd at times, but I'm always looking to see where they go too far.-And this movie has a few moments that are a bit hard to swallow and ignore at the cheese factor that they take to make their fantasy come to life.-One thing is the costumes they adorn and how selective their immunity is, there is a little more explanation, but it's quite amazing to see the double standards.-Other times it's about the invincibility factor that Wick seems to have, alongside the recovery part that gets stretched a little too much for my tastes. It might be part of the magic, but, the absurdity still is going a tad too far since the first movie.The Final Sequence Makes the Movie A Tad Long
-I'm one for action, but in this case, the final fight sort of extends the feature a bit longer than I personally enjoy given how absurd the final moment is.-A climb so to speak goes a tad longer, and though the moves are awesome, the comedy great and the tying of things together works... it does not offset that it wasn't needed given what was coming.-Chapter 4's length is going to be a solid hook for the die-hard fanbase, but for others like me, that final fight just goes a tad too long given there is still another action moment to come.The After Credit Scenes
-The fact there is one has me shake my head, but that aside, this chapter serves as something to try to tie up a loose story end they forgot, or maybe set the stage for what is next.-All I can say is that a long list of names to get there was mediocre in terms of what could be set up when it comes the world the High-Table focuses on. But was it needed? My opinion... no, not at all.The VERDICT:
John's fourth adventure was shaping to be one of the best action movies for me in a long time, and perhaps one of the best in this series. It's got heart, emotion, and depth I did not expect as the worlds collided and it balanced a lot of things to integrate into the action moments. The movie is visually impressive, a stunning collaboration of sound and video that combined with the planning, just gives this elite fighting movie moxie to make you squirm in your seat. And with all the dark antics and violence, this genre really does have a pinnacle sequel on hand to give the fans more of what they want, but actually push the envelope with it. And yet.. the movie still has things that are needing fine tuning to push to the pinnacle of movies. Absurdity is one thing, but pacing still has some things to work on to help give the movie the bite it wants, alongside the fact of trying to do a pinch more of character balancing that they seem to struggle. Nevertheless, this movie is definitely the leading film of the month right now, and has many things to drag you to the theater to see it. My scores are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 9.0Movie Overall: 8.0.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","grinningelvis","25 October 2023","Somebody thought it was a good idea to wedge some painfully dull melodrama in between the violence. What's with all this talking? This upsets me, because - simply put - every line of dialogue just means one less killshot to the head. The idea that these cardboard characters supposedly have ""inner lives"" is hilarious. The only ""inner"" I care about is their CGI blood.Honestly, I didn't really watch this movie, or any of the John Wick movies. I'm sure they exist, but nothing here registers in the permanent memory. I think a guy fell down some steps. Mostly they play in the background while I go about thinking on better movies and not killing people. But I thought it important to add a review here because I was astounded at how this artfully dumb and endlessly repetitive series continues to justify incredibly long screen times. Donnie Yen talks a bit. Ian McShane phones in his McShaneiest version of McShane. Is that Clancy Brown? He seems to be doing something. Oh, a fight scene! But 3 hours of this?My question for the John Wick universe is why? Video games already exist, and you get to control the character.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","vjspyjwpr","1 April 2023","This is by far the worst of the 4 John Vick movies. It doesn't explain much to the viewers about what is going on and why. As in the other Vick movies the hero kills and kills, in many scenes they have so many killers coming at him and shooting that it would seem to be impossible for him not to get shot. He does wear Kevlar suits but Kevlar suits do not cover his whole body and Kevlar generally will not stop bullets from long barreled weapons such as assault rifles which are in use throughout the movie. In a 'shoot 'em up' movie like this the viewer has to suspend belief and just enjoy the action but the writer(s) and director took too many liberties, the movie isn't believable - even with suspended belief. At 2 hrs and 45 minutes, this movie is way too long, to fill that time they included long scenes of killing bad guys and it gets very repetitive and tedious. You should skip this movie, it's not worth 2 hr and 45 minutes of your life.","1/10"

The other movies felt like the fight scenes were part of the story and this one feels like they did fight scenes just to do fight scenes.It's kinda hard to put into words but watch it, and I recommend watching it, and you'll see what I mean.

There are a lot of twists and turns in this one, along with some of the best fight choreography in movies. The longer running time didn't really seem like much since the pacing of this film is fast and exciting.One note: Lance Reddick's final onscreen performance was sentimental to watch.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","User145111","2 June 2023","Another John Wick film, another unbelievable shooting fest. Unbelievable in the sense that one cannot believe how useless and incompetent everyone in the film is. Apart from the eponymous John Wick of course.Every single goon/henchmen in this film acts as though they've never held a gun before in their lives. They constantly run out of cover, fail to react to anything happening in their surroundings and have precisely zero survival instinct. In this world John Wick is a legend. Everyone has heard of him and act as though he is the devil himself due to his skill and willpower. One would think then that the goons would know not to get close to him due to his grabbing, grappling and gun-fu abilities. Nope. They will happily run around without a care in the world acting as though they practically wish for death.You know how everyone in this universe has a bulletproof suit? Maybe aim for the head every so often. Or, just flail around and allow for your attacks to ping off of John Wick's torso.It's incredibly distracting. Reeves just seems tired to the point of taking Wick's melancholy, stoic personality to new levels of boring. Fair play to him for being the age that he is and committing to the stunts as much as he does. If only the fight coordinators could muster similar levels of enthusiasm for their work.Blind Donnie Yen makes no sense.","1/10"

Also, none of the characters have any depth, i guess that was never really the intent of the writers, to go deep into the personas, but this flick is so silly and boring it was really hard to sit thru till the end. The sheer amount of assassins that cannot pull off a head shot from 10 meters away is perplexing. To go into all of the illogicalities of this flick would be a tedious and long task, so in summary: it's like watching a video game.

And a blind man who knows how to hit his opponents every single time, be it with a gun, a pistol or whatever. He even knows how to play cards and knows exactly which cards he puts on the table?And then the sweet lips almost pressed against a 50's looking microphone keeping the swarms of hitmen, that all seemed to be tuned in on the same radio frequency, informed about the whereabouts of their mark? In how many movies did we see this before?We could laugh about it all, but think about all these youngsters who take this as a possible reality: shoot everybody who is in your way and shoot as many people as you can. Seeing Mr. Wick as their role model in this brainless violence tsunami.Well, I guess playing a role like that pays well. But still there are people in the States asking ""Why is it that we have so many (school) shootings in our country?"" Maybe Mr. Reeves has an answer to that.","3/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","juspain-80969","5 April 2023","Most of the negative reviews cover why this movie is so bad. It's just unbelievably the same thing over and over again for too long. I'm pretty sure out of the hundred of people that were murdered in this movie, they were the same 5 stunt actors over and over again.I went with my buddies to this movie. Afterward we all thought this movie was horrible. One thought it was a comedy, because of the way the killings happen. I felt the assassins trying to kill Wick could have been soccer moms with no fighting experience, it was that off at how they could miss shooting a guy standing next to him. I dozed off for about 10 minutes.Overall there's no plot or story. It's just a bunch of confusing nonsense and horrible acting. This will be a forgettable movie. Do yourself a favor and skip it.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","mr-giroro","6 July 2023","This movie has achieved something that no other movie has ever achieved: This is a long movie with a running time of almost 3 hours (2 hours and 49 minutes), but the entire 169 minutes are simply an endless repetition of the same 10-second clip -- i.e., Keanu Reeves shoot a guy twice on the chest, grapple him, shoot one more time on the head, and refresh and repeat with another guy.Other than this, there is absolutely nothing in the movie. No decent story. No decent acting. No reasonable character development. Nothing. There is not even a single memorable action scene in the movie as all the scenes are something they have already used in the previous movies in the series. Each action sequence lasts good 10-15 minutes, and it was excruciating to watch them because it was so boring to watch the same action scene over and over.If you take a 10 minutes action sequence from the original John Wick and repeat it for 17 times, you will get John Wick 4. This is truly atrocious. Our time is worth much more than this.","9/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","lenses-39397","30 May 2023","John Wick 1 was over the top - but a plausible story for Hollywood purposes, and very entertaining. It has devolved to JW4 which is virtually unwatchable as a movie. If you can COMPLETELY suspend logic, you may be able to muddle through, but that isn't me. I can't believe it is many others either, but then again, sadly it is. Piece of crap would be complimentary.The fight scenes are a joke of complete disbelief.The story is weak.Blind guys can not avoid bullets in a gunfight/
Kevlar ""suits"" can not protect wearers from grave harm.""Everyone"" can not be thisclose to being able to beat the greatest ever.Women can't realistically fight highly skilled warrior men - no less multiple men.The sad thing is that this COULD HAVE been done well. The formula for a JW movie is ""the boogeyman."" Every extra in the movie can not come close to that level - that is horse crap. Trying to make each movie bigger and more extreme than the last is a mistake, destined for failure. This movie failed miserably. Writer, director, producers - complete hacks.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","stuit","28 March 2023","I paid $10 usd to see this movie at a matinee. The eye candy made the price worth it. That said, eye candy is almost all this experience offers. Most everyone involved in this film seemed like they were sleepwalking when the action stopped. It doesn't matter - everything in this picture is done for style points. There's barely any story here at all, and what story exists is so thin that it could be told in about 2 minutes of this 169 minute film. The remaining attempt to tell a story is so full of holes supported by bad acting and bloated style that it would have been a much better film just to leave it all out and just show a montage of fight sequences.The Marquis character never shows the ability to do anything except sneer in an outrageous French accent and surround himself with dumb lieutenants. The Bowery King and the Harbinger characters are trotted out at the beginning and the end of the story just to to provide some atmosphere.Rina Sawayama's acting ability is confined to contorting her face in into pithy expressions in response to her character's father's philosophical meanderings.Even though small arms fire fills the air and bodies pile up on the road, cars continue to drive around the Champs-√âlys√©es as if nothing is happening.The same thing happens during the disco scene, where perfect 20-something bodies continue to obliviously dance away while axe killings splatter blood all around them.The DJ drops the needle on a record to start a song (bad sign for a DJ), while the old reel-to-real tape keeps spinning...just because they look better spinning I guess.This isn't really a movie; it's more like a moving painting. I'm grateful for the resolution at the end of the film, because I feel sorry that the actors and the characters they play have to keep living out this drivel.","5/10"

When I first heard about it, I couldn't help but think of logic gaps, but hold on tight because this film hosts a record-breaking 10 kills per square meter in a single scene! The protagonist is truly a living legend, throwing action parties that span across continents.The finale of the film is absolutely mind-blowing, but wait a minute! John Wick has taken such a beating that he looks like he survived an avalanche! If it weren't for these flaws, it would easily deserve a perfect 10/10, but due to these minor hiccups, I'll give it a well-deserved 9/10. Nevertheless, let's not forget that this film is still legendary!Now, let's talk about the cinematography. The colors are explosive, as if they were on fire! The camera transitions are mesmerizing, almost like a dance with the action scenes. And the soundtrack fits the action sequences perfectly, as if the next fight song selection was a DJ's responsibility! This film is a treat for those who appreciate the art of action.And I can't go on without mentioning one thing: Keanu Reeves! We love you, man! Your performance in this film was fantastic, and we thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in the world of action with you!In conclusion, this film is destined to captivate action enthusiasts. If you don't dwell on the logic gaps, it offers a mind-bending and outrageously intense action experience. After watching this film, you'll find yourself expecting an action scene at every step, even in real life. Get ready for the ride of a lifetime!","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","Sunsphxsuns","28 March 2023","John Wick Chapter 4 is everything you'd want from this tremendously popular franchise. I would describe it as pure ""choreographed aggression,"" like a delicate ballet. But instead of Swan Lake, this is all about bullets and knives. Incidentally, don't trouble yourself with a body count. The sheer number and intensity of ""kills"" will truly elude you.JW4 rather nicely returns for a riot of startling violence tempered by a melange of perfectly cerebral philosophical moments. Unlike the sardonic ""ultra violence"" of Stanley Kubrick's, A Clockwork Orange (1971), JW4 is sensibly raw, with just enough creepy humor to keep you from completely jumping out of your own skin.It doesn't hurt that JW4 has a great cast. Reeves immediately sells Wick & company's dark commitment with a raw emotion somewhat reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood Western. The massive emotional exhaustion which unfolds simply adds more gravity to this newest Chapter. ""Sauce for the goose,"" one might say.Flaws? Very few. And JW fans won't care. This is what makes cinema so FUN, especially now that we're all feeling some relief in this post-pandemic world. JW4 is heavy, exciting, and has plenty of authentic action. You will NOT be disappointed!!!!","7/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","DavidPlaysThings","23 March 2023","I'm a big John Wick fan but I really didn't like this installment. I found it really bland and boring.The main issue was that the stunts felt like they pulled a lot of punches. Almost every action sequence felt numb, like they didn't have any weight or any stakes. Fight scenes would go for far too long and yet leave absolutely no impact. Someone could fall off of a building, shake it off and be totally fine again. There were acrobatics, sure, but it felt like Power Rangers combat.It also felt like this installment was being crushed under the weight of its own lore. The hints of greater lore and underlying history in the other movies were great, and part of what got me really interested in the continuing franchise. By the fourth installment this has become so all encompassing that it absorbs the whole movie in a convoluted plot of pomp and politics.","5/10"

The fight choreography is second to none, the gun play better than ever, and the casting is stupendous. The plot is top notch, the Wickverse is better than the Marvel Universe and any film universe.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","mike_morais_15","27 March 2023","The only two parts I loved about the movie was at Berlin with the fat German guy and at New York's library. The rest of the movie was a parody of the firsts movies: John gets run over by cars, falls from buildings, gets stabbed multiple times and gets back up immediately like it was nothing. Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby. Not intimidating at all...
To conclude, I was expecting more realistic scenes, more real motives for John to be angry against the High Table, more charismatic characters like the German fat guy and more original fighting scenes( like in the other movies where he goes from a arms museum to a horse stable üòÇ).","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","LukasValk","29 May 2023","(SPOILER FREE PART)It feels like every John Wick movie is a remastered version of a previous one. Better choreography, better fight scenes, better visuals, bigger budged but it's more or less the same movie with the same meh story and the same meh characters. Of course most of us know what a John Wick movie is so no one's surprised here. And if it is exactly what you're expecting than you won't be disappointed.FIRST, THE GOOD THINGSCinematography and production design, especially the colours. The colour palette is beautiful, maybe overdone here and there but most of the time it's just beautiful.Fight scene choreography is top tier as it was in previous movies and probably even better.Music is pretty good and in combination with the visuals it creates a really stylish and pleasant to look at movie.THE NOT SO GOOD THINGSThe characters are kind of cheesy as is the whole story, it's not terrible but it is not memorable.Also there's this feeling about this movie that the only thing that the creators were focusing on is how to improve action sequences at any cost even if it makes movie completely unrealistic. And I GET IT it is not supposed to be very realistic but at least it should be somewhat believable because sometimes it is so not believable that it's just breaking the immersion where this could be avoided.The worst part for me was the disconnection between the fight scenes and the surroundings like everything that happens to the characters happens in this fake world. It felt like the everything around the ones involved in the fights is just there to make it look good and make us believe that all of this is happening in the real world and not a movie set but it completely fails at that and feels like like some kind of exhibition of fight choreography.(SPOILERS BELOW)Couple of examples :Heaven and Hell nightclub scene.People mindlessly dancing and not paying attention to the gun chase that is happening in front of them. Shots were fired, axes were thrown, people were running, fist fighting, bleeding, falling down from deadly heights. Almost nobody cared. I GET IT we are supposed to believe that the music is very loud, people are maybe under influence of alcohol or whatever else but I mean come on shot were fired...The Place de l'Etoile roundabout shootout.This scene was very similar to the aforementioned.Once again the unresponsiveness from the cars around them was very immersion breaking. People were driving around like nothing is happening even though dead bodies should be lying around, multiple people walking and shooting in the middle of extremely busy traffic. Every car in the scene felt like was driven by the NPCs from a video game that have their dedicated route and it doesn't matter if they hit your with a car or not they will continue to go like nothing happened. And the end of the scene they show you the aftermath so you would think that this whole thing had some kind of effect to the traffic but until that point it didn't feel like that at all.Also the whole fight scene was so unnecessary long just to show some crazy moments were the baddies and John Wick himself was hit by the cars multiple times. At least those moments were indeed impressive. But if the scene was at least a lot shorter it wouldn't be as unbelievable as it was.And the scene on the stairs...was it really necessary? Did people actually enjoy yet another super long shootout scene where Wick kills yet another 50 bad guys but now on his way up the stairs (twice!) We've seen that already.And the blind guy...I mean come on he's blind...All these things that I've mentioned does not make John Wick 4 a bad movie but it is definitely not the best action movie as some wants to claim it may not even be the best overall John Wick movie.If you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the fight choreography you will probably enjoy it, but it feels like JW4 wants you to turn off your brain the most out of all 4 movies.All in all the movie wasn't bad, it's a bit too long, too unrealistic and the ending is unsatisfying.","6/10"

Or at least that's how it feels. 1 and 2 was ok. On one point I thought I'm back on matrix. Always additional opponents showing up - but of course always just two at a time and in the same order - two masked ones, two in suits, and then starting again with two masked ones etc. What a pity.There is only one nice thing - even though you could consider it as a bit too much: Camera and light were really great.","3/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","GusherPop","28 March 2023","Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have returned with ""John Wick: Chapter 4,"" a film that was supposed to hit theaters two years ago. It was worth the wait, combining the mythology-heavy approach of the last couple chapters with the streamlined action of the first film, resulting in a final hour that is among the best of the genre. John Wick: Chapter 4 opens with Wick (Reeves) on the run from the villainous Powers That Be known as the High Table. The main villain of the series is the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd), a leader of the High Table who keeps raising the bounty on Wick's head while he also cleans up the messes left behind. The opening scenes take Wick to Japan, where he seeks help from the head of the Osaka Continental, Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), and runs afoul of a blind High Table assassin named Caine (Donnie Yen). Laurence Fishburne pops up as Wick's Q when the killer needs a new bulletproof suit, and Shamier Anderson plays an assassin waiting for the price to hit the right level for him to get his payday. Despite the movie's epic runtime (169 minutes), the plot feels refreshingly focused again. The only minor flaw in Wick's armor is a bit of narrative self-indulgence, but fans won't care. This is a movie that should be seen with a cheering, excited crowd, as it has that contagious energy and is meant to be watched loud and big. John Wick has fought hard for it. The stunts and fight choreography of John Wick are top tier, and the director, Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman.""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is by far the best of the four films starring Keanu Reeves as the eponymous hit man. It has many of the same problems as its predecessors, but something happens late in the game that converts the film's merely technical displays of bloody murder into something suspenseful and romantic. Director Chad Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and there's fresh blood in the cast, most notably Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth. The details are too good to give away, but there's no harm and much pleasure in considering how the movie climbs to that light-headed summit. The movie reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. The stunt work is spectacular, with human bodies being hurled into moving vehicles and Reeves's double tumbling down the Sacr√©-Coeur stairs. Stahelski also delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in a single shot, the camera floating overhead. Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and introduces fresh blood in the cast, such as Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth.","4/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","kmyoutube","23 March 2023","I had some fun watching the film but I was disappointed quite often as well. I'll start positive. Keanu is kind of cool so that helped a lot. Now to some criticism. As others have mentioned, most of the fight scenes were choreographed so embarrassingly bad that I spent most of the film watching bad guys standing off to the side and waiting for their turn for John Wick to kill them. We see literally hundreds of trained assassins pointing and shooting high powered automatic weapons John at (who is usually standing out in the open) and yet non ever strike John. John falls flat on his face from the top of a building, gets hit 5 times by speeding cars,rolls down 6 flights of stairs after being pummeled relentlessly and in every case gets up almost none worse for wear. Even his suit never got dirty. At some points I accidentally laughed out loud.A huge, huge plot hole was the radio announcer stating John's every move and update (including the increasing bounty money for killing John Wick). There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time. Who listens to radio now anyway?The ending!?! Did he die? Did I miss it? One minute he's shot but still walking, talking needing a little rest and bath. The next scene shows his tombstone. Totally disappointing vague ending.I had no idea how long the film was. It actually went fairly quickly although most of the fight scenes were double the length I felt they needed to be.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","persister-71174","1 April 2023","I was greatly disappointed with #4. The story line was weak. If all you care about is mindless fighting and shooting, you will be happy. I know that is the key element in this story, but people still need a good story, and some actual acting. As it was released, it is already quite long. So, I feel that they could have eliminated much of the ridiculous fighting in the traffic circle of Paris and added more meat to the story. Too much of the movie was incomplete. There could have been more for Lawrence Fishburne. And they could have done more with Shamier Anderson. I understand that they wanted to close out the series with John Wick's name restored. So, they could have done more, in the latter half of the movie, with his efforts to restore his name. This movie just didn't come together for me. As it stands, I think John Wick should have died at the end of John Wick 3.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","lancelong777","3 April 2023","Watching John Wick 4 makes me realize just how bad of an actor Keanu Reeves is. Many apologies because he is one of my favorite people in movies. Notice I didn't say actor in movies as I think that after about 20-30 movies we can all honestly say that his skills have not improved nor have they changed. Having said that I will say that he is enjoyable to watch in movies like this even though I had to suspend my disbelief of my suspension of disbelief on multiple occasions. The story was not very interesting, the bad guy didn't seem very bad nor was I feeling like any of the action scenes made any sense - not that any movies really do. But I wonder just how many times a person needs to place a mag in a loaded weapon and then open the chamber to see if there is a round in the chamber. That was minor because I don't want to spoil alert anyone. I will say this however that if a spin-off is made or another John Wick is made I can honestly say I will not pay any money to watch either.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","matthewjones-56423","23 March 2023","This movie is so bad that I stopped watching it inside the theater to write this review...What happened here?!? I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I come to see ""John Wick"" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three films to shine is gone. The ""John Wick"" franchise has completely disappeared up its own a*s. This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no ""real world"" anymore. Every single character in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.Now, let's discuss the action and the fight choreography, the two biggest letdowns about this film. This was not just bad fight choreography for the Wick universe, this was bad fight choreography for a straight-to-streaming action movie of the week. As Wick is fighting various henchmen in the ubiquitous club fight scene that goes down in every Wick movie, you can literally see the enemy assailants waiting their turn to attack him. Numerous times, you can clearly see a henchman in the background literally just standing there swinging his weapon at nothing because it isn't his turn yet in the choreography to attack Wick.Also, the ""Gun-Fu"" crap was novel and fun in the first two movies, now it's completely taken over. Rather than the dazzling martial arts, melee weapons, and close quarters combat we've come to expect from this franchise, we're now forced to settle for an endless barrage of gunfire and gratuitous headshots. There is very little actual brawling in this film. It's like the scene in Indiana Jones when he opts to just shoot the sword-wielding henchman rather than actually fight him. ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is just that scene repeated over and over and over again. Every time a new villain squares off to John and appears that they will be formidable, Wick just shoots them in the head immediately without even so much as a slap fight to satiate our palettes. It gets so boring to watch really fast. I think Keanu is getting up there in years and can't quite bring the fury like he used to; so, the filmmakers decided to just let him shoot everybody rather than fight them.Now, let's go back to the big club scene and talk about how unrealistic this movie is. During the scene, the sprawling night club is packed to the rafters with club goers who appear to be dancing to different music than that which is playing. That's not even close to the silliest thing about them though. As though they were brainless party bots that knew only how to dance, these morons would just stand there gyrating poorly to generic Cyberpunk music while people were being brutally slaughtered by axe right next to them. None of them bats an eye, runs away, or attempts to protect themselves. They just keep on dancing like the NPCs inside a night club on Grand Theft Auto. It was some of the most negligent filmmaking I've ever seen.Simply put, there was no grace to this film and it was a horrible way to end the franchise. To all of you out there saying that this is ""the best action film of all time,"" maybe you should rent ""The Raid: Redemption"" or ""The Raid 2."" Those are action films done so well they were basically art films. Iko Uwais is the most talented martial arts working in film today. Or, even easier, go rent ""Atomic Blonde."" As a former ballerina, Charlize Theron was able to memorize in excess of twenty moves at a time, which resulted in the directors needing to cut much less frequently, creating a very seamless, realistic effect to her fight scenes. The director referred to her as belonging to ""the top 1% of actors who can perform their own action."" ""Atomic Blonde"" is one of the best action films of all time and no one seemed to notice it. Such a crime...Anyway, ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" sucked. You're better off staying home and sticking your head in the oven. Don't waste your money seeing this film in the theaters. It'll be on cable eventually, so just wait for it. This movie is where dreams go to die. Score: D+","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","rich-mac","27 May 2023","There really is very little story time - maybe 20 minutes of the runtime - but probably not that much. The rest is just basically the same kind of fight scene, repeated over and over in different locations. The locations are mostly great - the monotonous action wears very thin quite early on.I seem to remember that some of the earlier Wick movies had proper story lines - somewhere along the line they ditched them for non-stop repetitive action - action that stretches credulity well past breaking point - but some of it, especially towards the end, was ridiculous nonsense.For any serious movie buff this installment completely fails to make the grade and is a total waste of time. Worse, it sullies the franchise.2 stars for the locations, and because it's professionally made technically.Minus 8 points for the lack of an engaging story and for reaching a new high for banal gratuitous violence.Summary:

"John Wick: Chapter 4","hanschsolo","1 April 2023","While John Wick 4 points with extraordinary beautiful cinematography and some well-made action sequences, it fails apart at two key points when it comes to movies for me.Firstly the plot. What is this even about? Who knows. People care for the action. But why do we then need to watch more than one hour of build-up for the action, you could watch the action without understanding what is going on, you don't need to know why these people fight, there is no conflict, and even if there is, it doesn't matter, because it has no consequences to the plot. The problem is that the plot is only sequenced trough talking, no visual language.That makes the movie feel like a video-game. The action-scenes are the one you interactively play, and the talking scenes are just long cut scenes. This Formula works for many games, but you can skip those cut-scenes. If it's a good game, the gameplay will make your blood rush and you will not care for that dialogue pause. Best example is Hitman, you don't care for the story, you just want to play.What is John Wicks Goal? I as a Viewer, gather nothing from the motivation of revenge, since the first movie the goal is the same, and it doesn't carry the weight of the first one. He does this all because of the last present his woman gave him, because of a dog. And while the film could dive into wicks character and analyze his psyche, and his former relationship to his woman, because she's the reason of this all happening, It rather focuses on an old friendship that now turned into an rivalry. I want to understand this man, and empathize with him, but the movie simply doesn't care about it's character work and the plot.Secondly the Pacing. It takes too long for the action to begin, and when it ends, it again takes take long until it begins again. A Simple process. And if the story is not compelling enough, it's hard to get trough.I feel like people are getting easier to please within every year and call everything a masterpiece. People seem to go crazy for mindless action without any substance. Without any conflict and emotion. It's nothing new. It's nothing we didn't had 20 years ago.Yes, the Action is good filmed. The lighting is great, but what does it really matter? Is an good action flick really what we need more of nowadays. The genre is oversaturated. It has no weight anymore for me. Filmmakers need to try and do something fresh. I do not want to turn of my brain during a movie.After one and an half hour during the movie passed, I asked myself an Important Question during the movie.What was the intention of John Wick 4? It was not a Vision the director wanted to show us, because there is no vision. Most importantly, there are no emotions. Nothing to move the audience with. There is no art behind this. Even if it's well made, this whole movie feel feels like an ad.So now, I know exactly what the intention of John Wick 4 was. It was Money.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","purplemania-339-801099","5 June 2023","I liked the other John Wick's. This one was over the top ridiculous. From the blind man that was somehow a better swordsman than everyone and a better shot than everyone to the fat guy that somehow could fight like chuck norris... The movie is about 2:45 with at least 2:15 of that time gun fights at close range where everyone gets hit but no one seems to die.Yes, I realize it's a movie but the unrealistic activities are way too much.. seems more like a version of the animated Batman show from the 70's where the bad guys just keep coming out.... Over and over again...Super explosive fight scenes but no plot whatsoever... very disappointed. I paid $20 for this crap.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","marwinsingh-30063","24 March 2023","There is no denying that John wick series will become an classical masterpiece in future.. If you've seen previous 3 films you then you should know what to expect.. Keanu Reeves is back again legendery hitman aka Baba Yaga who'll stop at nothing to earn his freedom and defeat high table and seeing him doing that will give you an unforgettable cinematic experience.. For 3 hrs I was lost in this epic world that director Chad Stahlski has created for this story, Keanu Reeves is already an action icon, rest of cast has also done a perfect job.. Action choreographer and stunt team deserves an Oscar for their effort which lead us to some of the best fight scenes and action sequences ever played on big screen.. Cinematography is also very beautiful, dark and neon filled visulas just enhance the experience of story there is also some drama and emotional moments in this story but main aspect of this film is out of the world action.. There is a unique over the head camera action scene which is best part of this movie, Donnie yen is also great here proving again that he is one of the best action stars of Asian cinema, Scott Adkins is also done a surprisingly great scene which I was not expecting because he usually play hardcore fighter in his movies here he is hilarious and his look is different.. From start to finish JW 4 is an action ride which gets better and better each passing minute, 3rd act will keep you edge of your seat, last 45 to 50 minutes were some of the best action sequences I've ever seen in my life and I've seen thousands of films from every genere from all over the world cinema industries so i know a good action scene when I see it and believe me this was something I've seen first time in my life.... Overall don't miss this film if you're fan of action movies and if you're an Baba Yaga fan like me then just go for it to experience it on big screen with Dolby atmos sound you'll spend a quality time....AN MODERN ACTION MASTERPIECE.. 10/10 ..","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","icullenengineer","28 May 2023","As a big fan of Mr Reeves (the replacements is his acting apex in my opinion, point break best overall movie) it pains me to rate this even at 4 stars.There is essentially zero plot.Close quarter action sequences dilute this movie to the point of being irrelevant. There is zero plot (I know, please bear with me) evolution with this story, hashed out dialogue that would make James Corden blush, cameos that feel like they're there for no other reason than to create a TV spinoff and cinematography that would make any film school graduate turn in their future grave.You know how you watched the fast and the furious film up until 9 and then went ""naaah that's enough, I'm done""... you'll reach that point with this movie. Watch the first one and bedo e with how good it was....remind me of another Keanu franchise!!","10/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","hfreinoso","9 April 2023","John Wick Chapter 4, directed by Chad Stahelski and stars Keanu Reeves as the main character John Wick. This is the best film of 2023, already. There I said it. It's already the best film of 2023. John Wick's Chapter 4 is one of the best action films this decade. I enjoy this film, no; I loved this film. I loved this film, My dad and I watched John Wick's Chapter 1 on opening day, and now we watched it on opening day; and Chapter 4 didn't disappoint us at all; we had the best time with this film. Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, and Scott Adkins were brilliant in this film, and they didn't disappoint us in this film as it's such a good plot during this film. The story is well done as it shows and expands the new assassin world. And the action, I can keep going on and on about the action and I am so anticipated that I want to see the movie again, of how good the action is especially the overhead scene that was inspired by Hotline Miami. That scene alone made this film a masterpiece. I could watch it over and over again and I will never get tire of watching it. The story is really good and the ending was a huge plot twist, as we though there were going to make Chapter 5. And in all honesty if they end the story here with John Wick, that would be okay, because, I seriously don't know how on god's earth will they top this film. And If they ever do a Chapter 5, Please bring everybody back that did Chapter 1-4 for Chapter 5. My dad and I are huge fans and we will continue be fans, we love the film and for my dad it's already the best film of 2023 in his eyes. Cinematography, soundtrack, visuals are ALL astounding. There is only a nitpick and that is John Wick still is clean after all the fighting. Overall, John Wick's Chapter 4 is a true masterpiece of action filmmaking. It's a film that manages to exceed the high bar set by its predecessors, delivering a thrilling and emotionally engaging experience that leaves you wanting even more. If you're a fan of action movies or just great filmmaking in general, then John Wick Chapter 4 is an absolute must-see film. I give it a 10/10 rating without reservation. I am wanting this film to get this film a billion dollars at the box office, Because it deserves the money, and time to see on the BIG screen. I am going to see this film over and over again. It's a masterpiece. 10/10.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","AO8","28 May 2023","Was very excited for this movie. Watched the other 3 and thoroughly enjoyed them. However, this one was just okay if not bad? Idk if im getting older (in my late 20's now) and maybe these type of movies just don't entertain me as much they used to, but the fighting scenes were boring. I could see the ""WWE"" in it, and the exaggerated acting of the henchmen. Even with that, i was okay but the exact moment where I just lost interest was the fighting scene in the ""dance club"". You have john fighting and him hacking a guy in the head with an axe, shooting and then even being dragged up the stairs by his tie and the random partying civilians around just....stared and kept dancing? No running or screaming? Wtf? Like even a meth head would run at that sight...Like I get it's not supposed to be absolutely real, i mean tbey have bullet proof suits but. C'mon.","1/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","jonathan_m_woods","22 March 2023","Its also ridiculous,. Outrageous, ludicrous, and hilarious. They have uncut action scenes that last for minutes now. Easily the overall best action stunt movie for the art. Simple story and Wick indestructible. But so worth it. Fighting up an endless staircase against innumerable foe to the music of Justice. Bravo. The most imaginative chorography fight scenes I have ever seen. They push the limit, the intensity, the absolute insanity how can it not be the perfect action movie created. From fists to firearms this movie does not miss a beat. The best of the best of the best fight scenes. Take a bow.","2/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","chand-suhas","23 March 2023","John Wick Chapter 4 is lengthy. By lengthy I mean it has an action packed first act followed a slower second act sans much action but makes up for it with the craziest final act where all hell breaks loose. John Wick after surviving the fall in the previous film, gets back to business of killing his way to freedom. The table has found a new head who pits John's friend against him. As the brutal fight resume, John is suggested a clever way out of this mess and how he pulls it off being an ex-communicado forms the story.Donnie Yen's addition to the franchise takes the fourth film a notch higher, raising the bar for the stunts. The first act is indeed action packed and it flies by quicker than the bullets fired. The second act gets the story forward without much action until Scott Adkins shows up, which makes for a stylish action block with enough humor. The highlight is however the final act in Paris. The insane action sequence leading to the final fight gave me my money's worth and also covers up the generic weak villain which Bill Skarsg√•rd tries to make merry off.It is indeed a fitting entry to the franchise and the first John Wick film to have an end credit scene, one has to sit through the end credits completely for that scene.","4/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","meaneye-rcf","20 June 2023","To be honest I didn't like this part of the series. From the moment it starts it's non-stop action with little to no world building, story or character development.People come in, do something, talk about something very important and then leave never to be seen. And it happens multiple times. It's just thing after thing after thing. And it's always boss above bosses. Another secret thing inside of this secret thing inside of this secret world. It's getting old and annoying.Chapter 3 was worse than this from entertainment point of view, but not by much. First movie made you feel emotions and it was very well directed. Second was mostly pointless action but both movies had great pacing. Here it's feels like you are trying to sprint with one leg. We are constantly behind on understanding who the hell are these new people that appeared, why is this happening, why now and why the hell no one remember to get bazooka and hunt Wick. Police is not caring for literally hundreds of dead on the streets of Paris, why would rocket launcher be a problem.Over all it was ""meh"". It happened, I watched it and will never do so again. Unlike the first movie.","5/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","cms-14228","25 March 2023","The John Wick movies have run out of ideas and just rehash the other movies. Keanu is still stiff and half asleep throughout the movie and luckily they give him very little dialogue. The other actors are superb especially Donnie Yen, who is an actual martial artist. He's so good he makes Keanu look especially bad. Scott Atkins is great and his martial arts skill shines in this movie.The plot is ridiculous as usual and the killing count is very high. It seems like the director enjoys the same backgrounds.....church, falling down lots of steps, dance hall where everyone keeps dancing even though there is gunfire.It lacks the humor of the Taken movies and great acting in the Equalizer.","9/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","wesoly-68543","5 June 2023","So before watching this piece of really uncooked pasta i watched again three previous movies and with great regret I have to say each movie after another are getting worse and generic and predictable. Plot is there just to justify the fight scene after another one. Some people write the fight scenes are on another level I do not agree. For me they seem like a choreography and sluggish. Way to many moves to finish off an opponent. Did anyone count how may times John shot his gun from the car at the huge roundabout? 38 times give and take and just in previous scene when he got the gun from the King he said it holds 21 bullets!!!! Apparently this is not the last one John Wick but just like Fast and Furious this movie gets just ridiculous. Keanu please just stop!!!!","7/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","luke-retrorocket-gg-96525","22 October 2023","It's an average film. Worst of the 4.So convoluted and extended for no reason other than to show off the brilliant choreography and fight scenes - which were all excellent, dynamic and exciting. Didn't justify the almost 3 hour runtime.However some of them went on for too long that it almost became Family Guy-esque and a bit cringey and laughable. Everybody seemed to have these bulletproof suits on and no one could shoot in the head it seems. The Table were too 'illuminati'-esque, just with unbelievable rituals and rules that seemed to apply when the movie needed a narrative shift.Caine was a laughable character - I can honestly say that didn't know if they were making him walk/move/fight in a certain way to try and get us to empathise with his blindness or trying to make us laugh - in a comedic way.As for comparing to the other three movies, it just didn't feel real anymore - not that much of the other 3 movies are close to reality, haha. Just focussed on the fights and making characters seem cool as opposed to a semi-decent story and narrative.It actually felt like a video game! John would go to meet and find what he needed to do, but then had to do a side quest in order to get the information and enemies needed 3 headshots to be killed, lol.As I said, it was an okay film and a decent action movie, but falls short of the other 3 films.","3/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","SaintMastodon","20 January 2024","John Wick continues to fight for his freedom as the assassin guild he dishonored sends their very best to kill him.These movies keep getting better and better. Similar to the Mission: Impossible and Fast & Furious franchises, the John Wick series knows what it does best and doubles down on the action, drama, and fight scenes in this fourth installment.Donnie Yen's Caine and Shamier Anderson's Nobody are the perfect counterparts to Keanu Reeves. I wish we were getting a movie with all three of them fighting The High Table. Everyone was raving about ""that stairway scene"" when the movie first came out. I personally thought the poker game, and resulting fight, at Killa Harken's nightclub was my favorite scene.Having said that, the action is some of the best I've seen (Sisu vibes). Reeves continues to dazzle audiences with his combat capabilities. Anderson has a fun arsenal. Yen plays yet another blind man with a deadly weapon. Bill Skarsg√•rd was a good villain but I wish we had more from him.If the franchise continues, I hope they stay as grounded in reality as they can. Some of the lines, characters, and gadgets had a little bit of a Bond feel to them. I don't want the John Wick series to suddenly become about gimmicks and snappy one-liners.Prop I Want: The nunchaku John Wick uses

"John Wick: Chapter 4","benmaffin","23 August 2023","Maybe the screenwriters in the US were on strike when the screenplay got written; maybe they'd outsourced to the writers of Eastenders. The three main characters do sound like the start of a bad joke. I'll let you figure that out.I do know that AI didn't write the latest chapter in the John Wick Chronicles, as no self-respecting computer would do such a lousy job.It's as if the producers just copied and pasted the same scene 15 times, borrowing from the previous movies, until they ran out of RAM on the editing machines. There's no original story; Keanu thinks about the paycheck as every CGI 'enhanced' fight scene starts. You can see it in his eyes.And don't mention Kevlar suits. Whoever came up with that concept should be, well, shot. And why do the bad guys all have access to handguns but nothing else?Chapter 4 falls so far short of the first film; it's impressive. It's rumoured Sir Ranulph Fiennes has been called in to find the route back to the original.It is highly polished. There are some great tracks in its armoury. And the overhead shooting in one of the later parts of the film was just enough to keep me watching s I'd not seen it done before.But only just. If I'd paid for the film, I'd ask for my gold coin back.","3/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","stevendbeard","25 March 2023","I saw John Wick: Chapter 4, starring Keanu Reeves-the Matrix movies, Dracula_1992; Donnie Yen-the Ip Man movies, Shanghai Knights; Shamier Anderson-Awake, Wynonna Earp_tv and Bill Skarsgard-the It movies, Atomic Blonde.I love the John Wick movies and they just keep getting better as they go along. The action is off the charts, the stunts are better than ever, and just when you think there is nothing new to see in a fight-or car chase-Baba Yaga will surprise and shock you. Keanu returns for maybe his last ride as John Wick, at least according to how this one wraps things up-but, I'm sure Keanu still has another one or two left in the tank. Bill plays the Marquis, a sort of big shot in the High Table organization that wants Keanu dead. Donnie plays an old friend of Keanu's that Bill forces to hunt Keanu. Shamier is another hired gun that Bill gets to join in on the hunt. Shamier is called the Tracker and has a highly trained dog that tag teams Shamier in fights-on voice commands. All Keanu wants is to get his freedom back and his name cleared. He learns of a loop hole in the High Table rules and focuses all his abilities on reaching that agenda. One of the fight sequences on a flight of stairs is very entertaining and the car chase in Paris is unbelievable-kudos to the stunt people. Make sure you don't leave the theater too soon because there is a scene after the end credits that involves a characters' fate and there is a dedication after that to Lance Reddick-he died March 17 2023-who played the hotel concierge, Charon.It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","10/10"
"John Wick: Chapter 4","eltoro1234","24 June 2023","Don't get me wrong I like John Wick, but this 4th chapter could and should have been wrapped up in under 90 minutes instead of 2hrs 50m!!! The story is good with underworld vibes all played out in beautiful locations and backdrops, it loses its appeal as a movie because it plays out like a triple A computer game, the only difference being there are far less fights and bullets fired in a computer game, the fight scenes should've been far shorter and we'd still have got the gist, think the Bourne movies! Instead we go through scene after scene of moves that would be more at home in Swan Lake and more enjoyable I might add, I swear I can see the actors counting in their moves, 1234 roll 1234 pivot, pivot, pivot (Sorry couldn't help getting a bit of Ross Geller in there).I'm writing this review whilst the movie is running, and we're 25 minutes into what I think is the end of level boss scene, sadly it's all become a little farsical, not only do we have John Wick falling from a 4th floor window to the street below, with a quick shake of the head, he's back to his senses and he's off again, incredible, and all done without a figure hugging body suit emblazoned with JW in sight! We also have a blind samurai sword wielding assassin...I know, not my idea. And throughout the franchise we've been led to believe that John Wick is the greatest hitman of them all, but even the great John Wick with his 20/20 vision is unable to despatch this blind assassin, even failing when equipped with not one but two automatic weapons.I know it's a movie and one should go with the flow, but this is just one chapter of the 4 part (I hope) saga, that we could've done without.Sorry John, but it's time to retire.","3/10"

"John Wick: Chapter 4","rockyandbullwinkle","29 May 2023","The fight scenes tell it all . . . Excruciatingly slow and overly choreographed. The guys he fights move forward and back like rag dolls without any effort on Keanu's part with overly emphasized movements. At one point the guy he was fighting had a gun and just held it limply waiting his turn to get his ass kicked. I saw the nods to the Matrix in a few scenes (the rain scene and the subway scene) which was interesting but I'm telling you the fight scenes were yawnworthy. The storyline was weak too . . . I thought he was going to take on the twelve but not only did he not do that but we are left with almost no knowledge about the 12. I would have liked to do more of a deep dive on that subject . . . Surely we could have investigated that more deeply in the THREE HOURS?? Keanu's movements are also getting too slow and deliberate. In a way I think that's why they ended his story . . . He probably wanted out. It was great to see Laurence Fishburne again since they snubbed him in the last Matrix movie but I would have liked to see more of a deep dive with his character. Overall I give this Mr Wick's swansong a ""C""","1/10"
"The Equalizer 3","FeastMode","2 September 2023","The Equalizer 3 is a solid concluding chapter to this entertaining trilogy. Even with an entirely new setting and cast, it does a great job of setting everything up and making you care about his new relationships. The movie overall is entertaining and mostly satisfying.As usual, Denzel is a beast. Charm and charisma are off the charts, this isn't news. Like with part 2, there are few looks he gives that chill me to the bone. It's so impressive the way he portrays being the nicest guy in one scene and the scariest guy in another.The only thing holding this back from being great is the surprising lack of action. Now I wouldn't call either of the previous movies action-packed. But I would estimate this one has a total of about 7 minutes of action. That's just not enough. And it especially hurts during the not-so-climactic climax.I still had a good time with this movie. If you like the series, I think you will be pleased. And to Hollywood: more Denzel please!

Bones broken and many cries of agony.But at least it comes from the villains on screen and not those in the audience.Coastal Italy is gorgeous.Denzel is a living legend.You've seen the other two films in this series.Wrap it up nicely with this installment.Ciao.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Sleepin_Dragon","26 September 2023","My expectations for this one were moderate, I enjoyed the first, I wasn't blown away by the second, this third and final movie is actually really good.It's a pretty good storyline, with Robert of course central to events and fighting for justice. He takes on Italian gang bosses, and of course there are multiple fight and action sequences, but in this film, he felt mortal, in the second I felt they made him into some sort of superhero, you felt he was indestructible, I didn't get that here.The action sequences are great, and it is very, very well produced, but the true winner here is The Italian scenery, it looks sublime, and arguably enhances the movie.Washington, outstanding once again, he really does nail it. This film has prompted me to get a hold of the original Edward Woodward series, that's up next.Entertaining.7/10.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","masonsaul","30 August 2023","The Equalizer 3 rounds out this unexpected trilogy with another satisfying action thriller that continues the journey of a man who understands violence, trying to finally put that behind him, placing him out of his element to show quite literally how far he goes for people. The ending hinders it a little because it feels anticlimactic but it still works.On a quest to finally find and maintain happiness, Denzel Washington is as flawless as ever. This time around he gets to be happy and show McCall actually enjoying life for once and as this is the final instalment there's obviously some introspection and self reflection as well.The villains are really weak, it's not a massive distraction as they remain easy to hate and don't take up too much time but as the marketing implied that this would be McCall meeting his equal is kinda laughable considering how little they feel like a genuine threat to him.The subplot involving Dakota Fanning initially threatens to derail the film but thankfully it ties back into the main narrative effectively and any scene she shares with Washington is great because it's both a Man on Fire reunion and her rapport with Washington is so good.Antione Fuqua's direction impresses yet again, the violence has never been faster or more brutal and the stark colour palette allows this one to stand out in contrast to its predecessors. The music by Marcelo Zarvos is better than it's ever been, so distinct and noticeably industrial.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","neil-476","3 September 2023","Robert McCall, seriously wounded during operational activity, recuperates in the incredibly picturesque costal Italian town of Altamonte, a place where comes to feel he may find peace of mind. Two things happen while he is mending: he sends some intel he discovered during the op anonymously to his old organisation, and he realises that a group of mafia lowlifes are making things bad for local residents. These two threads intertwine.Denzel Washington's 3rd outing as McCall takes us to more exotic locations, gives another nasty slow build but, fear not, we get a fair amount of action norwithstanding our protagonist being out of commission for much of the action.I really like McCall. There is something very satisfying in seeing an enormously sympathetic and likeable character who is capable of turning on a sixpence, and doing what they do to violent, repellent people, only doing it better. And with a cold, matter-of-fact lack of emotion.There were a lot of moments I lked here, chief among them a shockingly well realised explosion, and an ending setting up McCall, recent victim of a severe woung, outnumbered against a powerful, well armed and organised foe. And a brief callback to the two previous films caught me by surprise.","8/10"

What is funny is that in this third part of The Equalizer he is reunited with Dakota Fanning. The two already starred together in the 2004 film Man on Fire, but Fanning was only a ten-year-old girl there. In this film, she plays a CIA agent who tracks down McCall after an anonymous phone call to her agency leads her to a very large drug discovery on a wine farm. After a very strong first part, a fairly mediocre second part of The Equalizer followed in 2018. Now, five years later, you hold your breath a bit whether this third part is going to be worth it, of course. Well, that sounds quite negative compared to the second part, but it was just where the first part excelled, the second part had simply become more of a standard action print. Certainly not a bad film, but just less than its predecessor.In this film, the story moves to Italy, Sicily to be precise. McCall ends up badly injured in Sicily, where he is rescued by the local agent Gio Bonucci, who takes him to the local doctor Enzo Arisio. McCall comes to and befriends the locals. The village is only ravaged by the mafia and of course McCall won't let that happen just like that. The film takes a long time to explain everything. It all starts on the wine farm, where McCall is on the trail of serious criminals and also murders them. The action scenes leave little to the imagination and are sometimes just rancidly portrayed. After that, the film slows down considerably and takes a good look at McCall's recovery and how he befriends the local population. When he leaves an anonymous tip to CIA agent Emma Collins, it is of course a simple calculation that she will quickly track McCall. Meanwhile, McCall watches with sorrow how the local population is put under heavy pressure by the mafia. Of course you immediately understand that they shouldn't have messed with McCall.Most of the film seems like a long advertising film for Italy and it may evoke the holiday feeling in many viewers. The images are absolutely beautiful and eye-catching, something that enhances the atmosphere of the film. Still, a point of criticism can be made with the bad guys from the story, because we can't really say that they really express a lot of threat so that McCall faces a real challenge. But also the character of CIA agent Emma Collins has no added value in the film. You will therefore often wonder why she has so much screen time in the film. Not that it's really annoying or anything, but it doesn't really add value. Perhaps because this is the only film of the three that is under two hours, this storyline may have been intended as filler to keep the film from being too short. It now feels a bit like a wander in the story where the writers didn't really know where they wanted to go. The ending is what you can really expect from it and is of course accompanied by a lot of violence, but this so-called final chapter does not become as good as the first part.The Equalizer 3 may not be as good as the very strong first part, but it certainly beats the disappointing second part in every way. Denzel Washington returns for the third and, according to the subtitle, the last time as the ice-cold and tough retired commando who carried out so-called 'black operations' for the government. This time the story moves to the beautiful Sicily in Italy, where Robert McCall gets into trouble with the mafia this time. The role of Dakota Fanning is very superfluous and really adds nothing to the film at all, the mafia members don't really radiate a lot of threat, so as a viewer you know that McCall will not be faced with his toughest job. Still, the action is nice in the film and it also has a pleasant running time that has been kept under two hours. Whether this really will be the final piece in the Equalizer series is of course still the question, but it is clear that this is very pleasant viewing and simply an excellent action film.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","george.schmidt","3 September 2023","THE EQUALIZER (2023) *** Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Eugenio Mastrandrea, David Denman, Gaia Scodellaro, Remo Girone, Andrea Scarduzio, Andrea Dodero. The final chapter in the trilogy of the adaptation of the '80s tv series with Washington's Robert McCall attempting retirement in a Sicilian sleepy village where he finds the locals under the threat of the drug cartel led by Scarduzio which leads to a personal vendetta with copious bloodshed and retribution. Nice to see the MAN ON FIRE reunion of Washington and Fanning as a fed helping to snub out the gangsters. Washington is in fine form as the stil-waters-run-deep assassin whose dexterity never continues to surprise nor its ingenious gory outcomes. A fitting last dance (for now) directed with brio by Antoine Fuqua who helmed the series with aplomb.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","filmtravel101","13 September 2023","This is by far the worst script of the trilogy.The story is 80% denzel on holiday in Amalfi coastal village where he sips tea, watches locals and dines out all day. And then at the end kills a few bad guys - but at some point in 3rd act he offers himself up but bad mafia guys decide not to end his life in front of the village people and end this miserable excuse of a movie. You almost wish they shot him to make it a tiny bit realistic and challenging.Oh and during his holiday which makes no sense at all and drags on like a slow Cond√© Nast tourist trip - it finally explains its lame story started because of some pensioner got hacked so he flew to recup 360k in cash and admits he does not even know the guy - huh?? Which feels more hollow than the shallow story - but let's not digress because the big reveal moment is the thinly written part of Dakota Fanning who asks did you pick me- duh - because she is daughter of his old boss. Really?This could have been revealed in 2nd act and made for a great story plot instead of 2 dimensional thin character that just acts like a teenager on holiday and definitely not CIA material - bad casting as Dakota best part is getting almost blown up. Good riddance but she survives.The entire film feels like a bad Charles Bronson movie from 70s and even the bad guys are pathetic characterization of the Italian Camora aka mafia.No idea how this film got such high ratings but by far the worst of the series and Denzel must have a Villa in Amalfi coast or family wanted a sweet holiday. Go in with super low expectations and you might enjoy the Italian scenery because there is not much equalizing - but loads of social dining. Maybe next film will include a Greek wedding4 stars to the food,fish, and tea - and Amalfi villages.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","martinrobertson300482","14 September 2023","I liked Equalizer 1 and 2 but this third entry has a ""might as well make another one"" feel about it. There are some brutal kills but some of them feel very phoney with their CGI blood.The plot is very straight forward and kind of predictable. The mafia villians are pretty dumb. While the random scenes featuring a grown up Dakota Fanning feel tacked on and unnecessary.The other 2 movies built up to a big action finale. Which made for some standout action. The first one in a hardware store, and the second during a hurricane. But this one is just in some guys house.Its unfortunately very straight forward and fotgetable this time, but Denzel Washington has a few bad ass moments. If you want to wait past all the scenes of him tackling high stairs.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Tweetienator","13 September 2023","There is a strong similarity between The Equalizer and the John Wick series (and the Taken movies too): with every entry the quality and entertainment level goes weaker and weaker. The first Equalizer movie was strong, the second not so strong and the third one is, well, acceptable, but nowhere near the quality of the first one. Anyway, if you love to watch Denzel Washington and just want some explosions and bum bum, you still can put this one on your to watch list. Production is solid, Denzel cool as ever, that's about it. My rate for the first one is 8, the second got a 6, this one gets a 5 but no more.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","TheDanishMovie-Nerd","4 September 2023","Following the disappointingly lackluster sequel that notably marked the first time Denzel ever agreed to a sequel, ""The Equalizer 3"" remarkably surpasses expectations - though admittedly, I had set the bar fairly low. But any reservations were dispelled early on, as the movie plunged straight into its visceral, stylish action that sees Denzel masterfully blending the vibes of John Wick, Liam Neeson's unyielding avenger in ""Taken"", and his own enigmatic survivor from ""The Book of Eli"".Age seems like just a number when it comes to Denzel. As he inches closer to 70, there's no slowing down. The film cleverly incorporates his age into his character, offering action sequences that lean more on intelligent combat rather than sheer brute strength and stamina akin to Rocky or John Wick. There's an elegance in how he maneuvers, outthinking and outmaneuvering adversaries in ways that leave you awestruck.I absolutely loved witnessing the reunion of Denzel and Dakota Fanning, their electric dynamic echoing reminiscently of ""Man On Fire"". Their chemistry is undeniably magnetic, and adds layers of depth to the already charged narrative.One of the movie's masterstrokes is its unyielding focus on the sheer prowess of Denzel's character. He remains ever the cool, unshakeable force of nature, perpetually ten steps ahead of everyone, leaving both foes and audience in anticipation of his next move.While some might dismiss it as yet another action-filled extravaganza, for me, ""The Equalizer 3"" was the epitome of action cinema artistry. A mixture of raw, over-the-top action, the evergreen charm of Denzel, and a touch of Italian style made it the ultimate cinematic cocktail. It's a whirlwind of entertainment, action, and thrill - and I found myself completely immersed and gratified.In short, ""The Equalizer 3"" delivers in spades. For fans of Denzel and the action genre, it's a treat that shouldn't be missed.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","vengeance20","1 September 2023","Was forever searching up Equalizer 3 on Google sine the 2nd film & it was always just plain speculation. It was only until early this year though, that we would be getting a 3rd & until I discovered recently, a final entry in the Equalizer Franchise. I was hoping this would be good, but sadly it didn't quite hit the mark.The film sees Robert McCall who finds himself at home in Southern Italy, but, he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia.I found the film to be pretty weak. For starters, there's literally no action & any of that action that we see here, is way too few & far between. The story makes no sense whatsoever & it didn't help that a lot of the dialogue was foreign & subtitled as if the plot was hard enough to grasp as it was.Our main man just plods along after a killer opening for nearly a good hour & I found myself feeling frustrated with the fact that he wasn't doing what he did best. I mean, they could've easily had him go about his day-today life in Sicily & had him kicking arse & taking care of business, but no. We get a weak & flat film that drags along & along for 60% of the film. Disappointing.The action was good & the ending wasn't bad despite being weak in itself. I mean, just letting the main bad guy fumble about like a drunken lout throthing like a rabid rot wiler dog? No badarse fighting duel? Like I said, the gore was there & the action really deliver, but it was too few & far between.The film drags after the opening & if it's bad enough we don't get to see McCall doing what he does best, nothing remotely interetsing happens between the opening & the 3rd act. It's frustrating as given the first 2 films delivering like they did. I mean, did it not occur to the makers here that the film dragged on for a good hour with no action?This film seriously reminds me of Halloween Ends so much, a disappointing end to a promising trilogy. And to add insult to injury, this is the last one in the Franchise. What a way to send off the character for crying out loud...Despite the actors doing a good enough of a job in the 102 minute (1hr & 42min) film, it really lacked for me. The villains weren't even that interesting, not to mention their motivations.Overall, it's a disappointing & weak entry & final to the trilogy. From the lack of action, to the incoherent story to the dragged out feel to the ironically shortest film of the trilogy. This film really didn't cut the mustard & this is despite the gruesome action we got (what little of it) & characters who weren't all the interesting apart from the man himself ironically enough doing little to fa for 60% of the film. What a way to end the franchise. This is definitely the weakest one. Go watch it, but you'll be frustrated after the opening trust me.5/10.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Xavier_Stone","17 September 2023","What a joke of a movie. The into was great with a 5 min action scene, and then that's it for about half of the movie. He limps around in an Italian village and heals and develops into a drama/romance.Perhaps Denzel is aging and can't keep up with all the Tom Cruise action movies, or perhaps he's tired and wanted to do other than shooting all the time. Fine. Just don't name this part of the Equalizer series as it's not really in the same ballpark.Perhaps he's using Equal, the sugar substitute in his tea and that's the inside joke.Dakota Fanning as a CIA agent investigating drugs and cartels? Totally miscast and poorly. She still looks 13 even wearing some grown up jeans spouting a few intelligent lines.The story itself is sub par. We wait and wait for any type of action, and then we get to the boss fight.. and he goes home to eat pasta. Laughing out loud at the writer.Then some poor action in the finale after the pasta, when everyone is tired from the carb loading. Incredibly poor. 7 and 8 star reviews are just insane.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","nicolasroop","3 September 2023","It's not very often you see a second sequel in a film franchise and it actually turns out to be a very good movie. In fact, most of the time, they end up being some of the worst. Thankfully, this new entry by series director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington is a fantastic example of how to do a sequel right.I will say the film is not perfect. There are a few storylines that don't quite add up to anything, like Denzel's character having flashbacks of his murders and how bereft and awful it makes him feel. Something thay could have and maybe should have been explored just a bit more. However, that is ok because the film swiftly picks itself up and in the days where most films like this are over 2 hours long, this one keeps it's pace and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Good choice on the writers and directors part.The acting throughout the film ranged from good to fantastic. It seemed everyone was pretty much on point here as far as what their characters needed and how to display that to the audience. It was also lovely to see Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington back together. I would love to see them work together in other films because they have fantastic on-screen chemistry.Overall, one of the best sequels to a film I've seen in a long time. Although, not an entirely necessary one, but the story and acting is good enough to justify it's existence. Plus, can you really go wrong with Denzel?4 italian mobsters out of 5.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","bastille-852-731547","31 August 2023","Denzel Washington is undoubtedly one of the best actors of his generation, and he has starred in a wide range of roles including more prestige-oriented films as well as some mid-range action thrillers. This franchise, about a vigilante who will stop at nothing to deliver violent justice on behalf of those who have been wronged. The first two films were moderately entertaining action films largely anchored by Washington's charisma, but this film is a significant step down from the first two in terms of quality. It's even more generic, pointless, and lacking in creativity or soul, which is too bad given just how much I am a fan of Denzel.This film centers around Robert McCall living in southern Italy, having a seemingly idyllic life until that is derailed by Mafia gangsters. The first two films in this series were far from original, but they felt more unique in story than this film, which is completely by-the-numbers. There's never any real tension about the fate of neither McCall nor the vicious gangsters he's trying to stop. The screenplay is also generic and rote; moreso than in the earlier films. There's just so little to take away from the storytelling here besides sporadic, outlandish bursts of R-rated action. McCall's character isn't much further developed, the plot developments aren't unique or clever, and despite being less than two hours, the film feels a bit long. The only unequivocal positive is some beautiful shots of southern Italy.As a result, I do not recommend this film. This doesn't make Denzel Washington any less of an excellent actor, he just simply needs better material than this, as the overwhelming majority of his films are. 4/10.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","wittmann73","9 September 2023","I am a huge fan of the first part, the second one was decent, but this one was a huge disappointment. Hard to believe the same star and director were involved in this. The main problem is that this third installment is incredibly slow and lacks action, esp. When compared to the first Equalizer movie.That 80% of the film was in Italian with subtitles did not help.There are only three very short action scenes in this, one at the beginning, one in the middle and one at the end. Nothing about them is exciting or special. Most of the time you see Denzel sitting at a table drinking tea or walking around a nice Italian city. The villains are totally generic and forgettable. The sub-plot with a young female CIA agent is unnecessary.What left me thinking was why was everyone in this Italian city so nice towards Denzel¬¥s character, although they did not know him at all? Why did the doctor help him and did not report him? Why did the policeman help him, why did he not search his car or did any background check?The idea of McCall going against the Italian mafia sounded so cool and promising, but the outcome was disappointing. Maybe Fuqua and Denzel just wanted to have a nice holiday in Italy.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","alfredvankuik","5 September 2023","It's been a while since I watched the first two Equalizers, but I remember them quite fondly as fun movies that found a nice balance between a simple yet effective story and brutal, well-made action scenes. So when I discovered that a third installmant was arriving soon, I was excited.Today, that excitement was shattered upon actually seeing the movie. The Equalizer 3 stars Denzel Washington, of course. And he is once again brilliant. The story here is that Denzel runs into an international drug trafficking ring by accident while trying to steal back his Uber driver's pension fund. The opening is amazing, showing off beautiful cinematography and a creative action sequence in true Equalizer style. Enjoy it while it lasts, because that's the last you'll see of that.After killing off a few mobsters, Denzel passes out by the side of the road and gets picked up by a random guy who just happens to be the son of a doctor who in turn just happens to like caring for random people with bullet wounds. Of course he is also called Enzo and he is an almost offensively stereotypical Italian. For the next hour or so, prepare to watch Denzel Washington drink tea. This movie contains more shots of Denzel drinking tea than it does of him firing a gun. In this little Italian town everyone loves Denzel for no apparent reason, to the point where random kids and grandmas walk up to him and give him gifts without even knowing him. There's a woman who basically throws herself at Washington from the second she sees him. Within a week, the people call him ""one of them"" and will literally die for him. It's just because he's American it seems, because he doesn't do much else. He watches the mafia terrorize the town and the people he apparently loves so much, but he doesn't actually get involved for weeks, not even when his favorite shop is burned to the ground.Meanwhile, there's a hesitant subplot where a CIA agent is investigating the drug trafficking ring. She comes to Italy but doesn't seem too bothered with investigating the actual criminals. She just hangs around harrassing Denzel, who is not even trying to hide that he's guilty of many murders at this point. She acts like she's this accomplished agent, but literally all she does is repeat Denzel's findings to her superiors and take the credit for them. She explodes somewhere halfway through the movie and they basically give her a promotion and a medal of honor for it.The mafia itself starts out quite menacing. They are well cast and very violent, but by the time Denzel finally starts killing them (over an hour into the movie) he immediately kills off all the good mobsters in an underwhelming 30 second shot. That's that then. Now all we have left is Victor, a stereotypical mob boss with not much character to him. He's just evil and he likes money and Ferraris. He is now real angry at Denzel for killing his brother and they have a standoff in the town square. It's quite cool and I was getting ready for an amazing shootout, but instead Victor just leaves to go eat spaghetti with his friends. I'm not kidding. This mob boss, apparently the head of five huge crime families, then goes to take a nap with only a few bodyguards around even though he knows this masterful assassin is hunting him down.The final action scene mostly just killed my last bit of hope for this movie. The kills are dull and are just Denzel picking off guards with a knife one by one in pitch dark rooms. Victor barely puts up a fight and basically dies by getting hit by a Fiat Punto. That was it. The final Equalizer movie is now over and it contained maybe three minutes of actual Equalizing, most of which was incredibly boring. The cinematography is quite beautiful at times, the acting is great across the board, the Italian vibes are amazing and there's a few good and/or funny lines. But overall this movie was just an incredible letdown. I don't mind a slow buildup, but this doesn't build up to anything. The first half could've been great if the second half had a proper payoff, but all Denzel does is drink more tea and kill maybe five people to bring down the entire Italian mafia. The romantic subplot that is set up gets no real conclusion, the ending suddenly introduces a weird plot point that was never mentioned before and then it ends abruptly.Not every action movie has to be John Wick with non-stop firepower, but I do expect there to be some actual action. The Equalizer 3 never really delivers. It's a very pretty display of the Amalfi coast and Denzel's acting, but that's about it. It's a shame.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","ragingbull_2005","5 October 2023","This is the most Mithun- like film, that Mithun never did. The story line is thinner than a wafer and has a more laughable plot than a Woodhouse. The villain is more sinister than Thanos but dies, along with his troops, in a five minute burst of action.This must be the easiest money that Washington has ever earned. He literally sleepwalks, makes faces that seem to mock autistics and stabs /slashes / shoots armies in fewer than the time it took you to read this sentence.The third poorly made action film that I have seen almost back to back, after Jawaan and Gadar 2. It is in the same league, with no story, poor action set pieces and an avenging angel, who needs to take a chill pill.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","AfricanBro","1 September 2023","The equalizer always has a ""you should've..."" scene; 'you should've taken the money, you should've let me in' and they're all great. This installment doesn't hold back on action, while the first two films had the most memorable fights, this one still stands on its own. Plot progresses a little slower but still engaging. It's predictable, but that simplicity works in its favor, with no unnecessary additions which for me was the writers exude confidence in their narrative.This is exactly what you'd expect from an Equalizer film. The protagonist is more humane and compassionate, yet the action maintains its brutality. It's a journey of revenge and finding peace, a fitting end to the trilogy. The pacing is good, having serene moments alongside thrilling fights without changing the vibe of the film. The sudden religious rally confused me though; perhaps I just missed something earlier.It's Denzel Washington being a badass, always a treat to watch for me. Didn't give it a perfect rating. While it didn't blow me away, I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it. A trilogy binge-watch would make for a fun day, and I wish they'd re-release it for a triple feature like they did with Black Panther in cinemas.","7/10"

The violence is hardcore and bloody but the villains in this case the Camorra or Italian mafia are perfect bad guys for Robert McCall, the Equalizer.

"The Equalizer 3","GusherPop","2 September 2023","""The Equalizer 3"" is the best in Denzel Washington's film series, embracing an old western formula, specifically ""Shane."" The ""final chapter"" offers more dramatic heft and equalizing elements. The third installment by Washington, director Antoine Fuqua, and screenwriter Richard Wenk possesses sentimentality, reuniting the star with Dakota Fanning almost 20 years after his death in ""Man on Fire."" The film follows retired assassin Robert McCall, who helps those in need in Italy, where the Mafia provides ample human cannon fodder to eliminate. ""Equalizer 3"" begins with an R-rated opening sequence. McCall, a wounded gunfighter, is taken to a seaside village where the locals welcome him. He considers hanging up his guns and settling down, but the Mafia plans to take over the town, leaving him with a choice: to intervene or not. The film explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions in a dangerous world. The film is a thrilling and thought-provoking exploration of the complexities of human relationships. ""The Equalizer 3"" is a film that explores the fallout from a crime scene and a tip given to a young CIA agent by Robert McCall. The film cleverly weaves together various strands, providing emotional resonance despite the generic threat and big crime boss. The film, which has been released nine years after its first release, has a sequel and a CBS version starring Queen Latifah. Although not entirely convincing as a ""final"" film, it feels like it reaches a point where the story ends on a positive note for Robert McCall and all things equal. The film's emotional resonance is enhanced by the use of quiet strength and the presence of Andrea Scarduzio. The Equalizer 3 is the final destination on a nearly decade-long journey for the filmmaker and his leading man, Matt Washington. McCall, a government assassin, faces injustice and is unable to ignore it. After being rescued by a Good Samaritan, he finds a community under the oppressive and violent fist of local crime bosses, the Sicilian mafia. All hell breaks loose as McCall protects his new friends and their livelihoods. Washington appears more at ease in McCall's skin than ever, despite the internal battle he's going through. His ability to manifest this in both moments of calm (such as his ritualistic setting in a cafe) and moments of violence (such as picking off bad guys in a dark alley) is incredible. The character feels more of a personal stake in his actions, which is interesting as he has always dispensed justice with contained and almost indifferent rage. While not Washington's best work, it's a great performance hanging on the frame of another tight script by Richard Wenk, and it's undoubtedly his best turn in the franchise. The Equalizer 3 is a visceral sequel to Antoine Fuqua's franchise, featuring McCall's simple skillset and Washington's icy delivery. The film showcases Washington's ability to switch from sympathetic to killer, making him a step ahead of his enemies. However, the film's yawn-worthy, bordering-on-troubling context for its baddies prevents it from reaching the rewatchable heights of its predecessors, making it a less enjoyable experience.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","gimili3979","4 September 2023","The movie, Equalizer 3, starts out well. There is a rather good slow action scene to start the movie. But it is all downhill from there.Without ever really establishing a plot or a reason for why the Equalizer is where he is today, the movie does not flow like the other films. There is a mafia connection, but nothing else to really tell us why the Equalizer is doing what he is doing or why he is even still there.Like so many sequels, there is usually either more sex, blood, or violence. For Equalizer 3, it is definitely violence. There are some scenes where you almost have to look away because of how violent they are.It is just an awful story line about mafia, drugs, and possible terrorist ties that did not make sense. Like the film itself, everyone seems to know that Mr. McCall, the Equalizer, is a special person whereas the previous films tended to hide his unique abilities. There is no anonymity to the person or the story anymore.The previous plots were personal in nature while this one is completely impersonal. We get a hint at the end of the movie that there might have been a personal connection, but the story line is so convoluted that I could not figure out what the personal connection was or how it fit.The movie has enough action to get through it. But do not expect the level of story and plot line like you found in the first film or even the second. It simply is not there. Like a lot of sequels, this movie gets away from what made it such a good first movie to begin with.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","kevxzara","4 October 2023","Equalizer 3 well....This movie is a complete bore fest of a film. It is nothing like the other 2 at all.Most of the movie consists of watching denzel on the phone, drinking tea or walking around.Gone are the times you remember from the first movie with him checking his watch for how long it takes him to kill the bad guys. The reason for this is because you don't really see him kill any bad guys (a handful).Denzel character never felt in danger so i dont know why the trailer made it out like he met his equal as i dont recall him getting injured whilst In his new found happy place.So many people at the start of the movie have guns (adults) but yet doesn't get shot until a small child takes aims and fires and nearly kills denzel.All in all set in a nice back drop but honestly if you don't speak Italian or can't read the subtitles then you won't have a clue what's going on as majority of movie is in Italian.Conclusion = boring movie, lazy script, boring bad guys, nothing really ever happens unless you enjoy tea.Was it a good send off? NO NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.","3/10"

"The Equalizer 3","douglasmcbroom","6 January 2024","This is the best of the three Equalizer film's. The setting is spectacular! In fact, the tourism board of Atrani, Italy, on the Amalfi Coast, should send Director Antoine Fuqua a huge dish of Gnocchi alla Sorrentina!This is also the most violent and bloody of the three films. There are homage's paid to 'The Godfather,' 'Godfather: Part II' and 'Scarface' (in one scene). It also has the best storyline of the 3 films. That credit goes to writer Richard Wenk. Denzel is almost too old for this role, but he might have one more in him. Of course, as always, he's too cool for school!Frankly, this was the most entertaining film of 2023 I have seen, and that includes: 'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer,' 'Maestro,' and 'Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning,' although I haven't seen 'Killers of the Flower Moon,' yet. Let's face it, it was not a very good year for feature films!","8/10"

They believe they can freely encroach on rightful places, carving out territories or extorting protection money. We are the good guys; in fact, most people are good. Good people do good deeds, avoid conflicts, but unfortunately, there are always bad people trying to take advantage. They dine without paying, steal cars without remorse, and threaten others for money when they don't like something. Good deeds bring good karma, and one can only wish that good people have guardian angels like Denzel Washington's character by their side.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","rgkarim","2 September 2023","LIKES:The Music:
-Simple, but powerful, a track that holds the spirit of the Equalizer with its mighty instruments blaring and loud drums.-It holds so much in the tones and when used together with the powerful scenes and acting unleashed a power shot that makes the theater shake.-The majestic attitude of the pieces are awesome, and the versatility to it is subtle, but works very well for what they accomplished in the movie. Fantastic in just how much it adds.The Cinematography:
-One of the high points, the movie is solid in how much it captures with the shots they chose.-The filters are perfect to convey the mood, dark and foreboding at times, bright and hopeful in others, and a middle ground that conveys the level of the threat.-It captures so much of the culture of the setting, the feelings of the villains in their savagery, and the moments of dark dread and discovery to really hit hard.-And then you bring the moments of justice, the Equalizer trying to equal and adding that emotion that you love in these movies as the blow is dealt.-Every shadow, very alley, and every finishing moment drips emotion and I love that about this franchise in how it delivers that raw edge.The Sound Editing:
-Another small trick, another effective treat to help with hitting the high notes and putting another layer of the Equalizer.-The sound engineering is top notch, those awesome bytes brought in at the right moments to emphasize the movie.-Wet sounds of knives, blaring gun noises, and several other things add that realistic horror noise that fans love to hear. And other effects of crashing and destruction ring out to add to the carnage that smashes the ears and brings you into fun.The Acting:
-Another wonderful addition to the mix, Equalizer's setting welcomes the acting traits of the character and the talents they bring.-Mastandrea holds charm, that moral drive and character to pull the whole movie together in many ways. He's compelling, he's fun, he's sincere and sweet, and works super well with his cast to convey the family feeling.-Fanning is totally great in this role. She's not the most interesting or really intense CIA agent, but for the purpose of the character she works. Her dry delivery works with Denzel's demeanor, making a sort of body cop design of the characters thrive and have that charm I like to lighten up the movie without destroying the tones too much.-And Washington is of course the top tier actor who does so little and yet so much with his performances.-His lines might be monotone and seldom waver from the calm neutral, but the way he adds the inflections, the little pauses, and those hints of surprise help give them light.-While physical acting and mannerisms are a level on themselves giving the Equalizer that other half of the coin that is scary, intense, but good in many ways.-And the chemistry with so many people, touching up moments without straying too far from the character achieves in this series. What a great acting performance.The Story/Emotions
-Equalizer always has that underlying moral aspect that identifies but sells it in just the right touch of things to add that satisfaction without going into the cheese zone.-And this movie may do it the best in terms of the storytelling. Equalizer is not really the best in terms unique plot lines or surprises, but what it suffers in clich√© succeeds in execution.-This town he dwells in has a lot of charm and heavy character centric morals that are stalwart and the anchor to which we have everything latched on to.-Not enough? Well how about the fact that you get this stellar tie in to the other films and in a way that takes the relationships and fosters them to motivational heights?-Still not enough, well how about the effects of what happens during this movie and elevates Robert to that same level of heroism we love?-That's the feelings that I got watching, and the biggest punch of the movie and what I felt gave reason to go through the dark chaos again and the violence. That's the level of storytelling and use that a writer like me likes and what I hope you will enjoy as well.DISLIKES:Predictable:
-The plot sort of follows the same song and dance routine, and given the origins it's not expected.-You know who is going to suffer, you know how he is going to strike, and from the trailers can piece together the plot in minutes, including most of the big twist.-Throw in the foreshadowing and you really are only left with how gory will the kill be and those small details you forgot about in the beginning.Violence is the Highest:
-It's a vicious movie, and like the originals is a rated R movie for a reason.-This one though holds a savagery that exceeds the previous and so be careful because you are going to get things that might be disturbing enough to make you sick.-The sounds with the vicious actions are not holding back, with gruesome gore and death awaiting those at every scene. And sometimes it gets a tad excessive to go the routes, even though they add a bit of diversity.The Suspense/Mystery/Action are lacking
-It depends on what gives you the thrills and chills, but for me, this movie did not quite accomplish the task of the most thrilling movie.-Sure , it's got the justice action that delivers that moral satisfaction, but the journey to get there is a little bland.-Bad guys are cruel, with awful tempers, and degrading features, but they aren't the worst bunch in the land, nor really that imposing of rivals.-Even when the stakes get heated, this supposed antagonist group is quite mediocre in regards to the fight put up.-The mystery and the motivation behind it are realistic with the tones, but without that spark is rather bland nor mind blowing when the answers come out.-And as for the fights, again Equalizer 1 and 2 do more than this one, still showing Denzel being awesome, but just one sided and kind of lackluster in terms of the most stylish or unique finishes.The VERDICT:
Equalizer 3 succeeds on many levels for a third installment tying things up with the finish and polish that you hope this series will have. The movie has great sound editing and visual style that does a lot of the lifting and adds that edge this series is known to have. A strong acting crew further helps paint this little Italian family together, blending that attitude with good characters that become the central story component of this series. And with it, the story and morals that this series has are good, primarily the heavy moral components and the way it ties to the cold hard steel man that visits it. It holds so many great moments that really are that justice dealing goodness, with a set of finishes that though violent, hold so much bite to them in many ways. And to seal and tie everything together the way they did it, was classy and in check with the series. However, the movie is extremely dark and gory, easily earning the rated R mark and sometimes to a degree that is going to make people potentially not comfortable secondary to the level of extreme violence that was on profile. Sadly, the story, mystery, and the action did not quite make the violence and darkness not worth the investment at times, at least in terms of an action thriller sense. The endings of the others held that merit and wow factor, but this one, though again cool, just doesn't have that same spectacle or intensity the others did. Thus, it loses points in that regards, at least for this reviewer. Factoring all these together, my scores are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","thekingmanx","2 September 2023","NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE. There are no characters, there is no story, there is no action, there are no stakes, there is no moral or message or point. THERE IS NO POINT TO THIS MOVIE.Every character are stiff one dimensional pieces of cardboard. About 60% of this movie is just Denzel sitting around in a town in Italy doing jack becoming seen as ""one of them"". The villains are just some stereotypical mafia guys who are so laughably evil in cruel it's not even fun to hate them.The action in this movie is sooooooooo brief too. Denzel is pretty much never in danger and always just quickly assassinates the villians.And easily the worst part of this movie is the climax, because just when things are seeming to start ramping up, the movie is just over. Basically the big mafia boss comes to the town and threatens everyone because Denzel killed his brother in an earlier scene. So at this point you think there might finally be some big action payoff at the end. Nope. Instead what happens is Denzel just magically teleports to the bad guy's house (which he never knew the location of but whatever) and assasinates every guard one by one and then the boss without any sort of struggle. And that's it. He basically just kills everyone with no struggle. In a good movie, this kind of big bad mafia villian would be made to seem untouchable, and it would be an actual struggle for are hero to get to them and kill them. But in the Equalizer 3 are hero just kills a dozen men with no problem. There is no stakes no struggle no sense of urgency. You have no reason to be invested because at no point do you feel like there is any sort of danger.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Johnny_West","24 January 2024","Denzel is going to be 70 years old in 2024. Hard to believe. He is the one person that can do a Clint Eastwood better than Liam Neeson. I enjoyed this movie mostly because of Denzel.The story was really goofy. Denzel blows away 20 Mafia goons and a godfather, and then some little kid shoots him? He is miraculously rescued, which would be very doubtful since that little kid ran away, most likely to whomever was left of his family, and unconscious Denzel would have been killed off.Also unlikely is that the Police officer goes back to where all the Mafia guys were killed to pick up Denzel's car? Like nobody would have asked him why he was picking up the car of the guy that killed an entire Mafia family?If you pay attention, there were a fair amount of goofs, but this is an old school, 1960s type of movie, where you just sit back and enjoy watching Denzel make friends in Italy, and then kill all the bad guys. I enjoyed it. It was fun.So what if they filmed in one town but named it after another town that is not near the coast? So what if three guys are pointing guns at Denzel from different angles and he is sitting down, and yet manages to kill them all?One thing that I would have enjoyed is if the Doctor had more discussions with Denzel. There could have been a backstory about him and World War II and friendships with American soldiers that his family always remembered (for example).","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","joeyford-55342","1 September 2023","Great story. Starts strong and stays there. Amazing music propels the mood. We have seen the story before with Clint Eastwood, Stallone, Jackie Chan and others. This is Denzel at his best. You believe his inner turmoil. You feel his struggle: Is he a good man or a bad man? Does the good make up for the bad? There is a weight to killing. It weighs on your soul. Friends that do it for the military say it changes a person. The story is laid out in the commercials. Roberto comes to town and ends up fighting the local mafia. I cannot recommend this movie high enough after the crapfest of Barbie, Oppenheimer, Flash, Blue Beatle. Ugh. See this movie!","9/10"

I would take this over the Marvel materials from the past 3 years. Denzel's character is similar to the past but more economy of motion. I wish Dakota had more screen time. The scenes in Italy were lovely. I doubt we will see another one of these movies. This was an old school action thriller. The formula is pretty tried and true. I'm not sure how films have gotten away from what works. I hope all fans will turn out to see this film.

Denzel's performance, has McCall, feeling his age and mortality catching up with him. Dakota Fanning is also great has an agent, and her scenes with Washington are a highlight, they both where in Man on Fire (2004), you see the awesome chemistry with them. Bad guys are pretty good to watch. I Better warn you it things up a bit since the last two, but I still enjoyed it, a good ending to a series.","10/10"

"The Equalizer 3","luca-settembre","11 January 2024","The Equalizer 3 is the last chapter of the Equalizer franchise, and is directed by Antoine Foqua, and stars, of course, Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, and Dakota Fanning as a CIA officer.As an action movie fan, I really enjoyed the Equalizer movies, still being aware that we are not talking about masterpieces. They are fun and enjoyable vigilante movies where Denzel Washington is freaking cool and badass as he takes down, alone, large and structured criminal organizations. Without the value he brings into these movies, I don't know if they would be even worth watching. The Equalizer 3 fits perfectly into this path, with some slight changes.The first thing to say is that this movie is very very gory and brutal, much more compared to the first two movies. Clearly it was decided to go one level up, so one needs to be prepared. The movie looks very dark, the Italian Mafia gives sort of modernized Godfather vibes, and most importantly, is beautifully shot. All of that can be appreciated since the very beginning of the movie, where fantastic camera work is done as the viewer follows a man entering a building full of dead people, brutally murdered. This very intense initial scene really sets the tone of the movie, to which the music score also fits really well.The movie is located in a tiny Italian village, whose people are constantly threatened by the mafia, where ""business"" brought McCall (Denzel), too. This is the third big action movie to be shot in Italy (after Indy 5 and Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning) to come out in theaters in 2023, at least that I know of. Whether or not this decision is based on financial benefits of some sort, it provided The Equalizer 3 with beautiful and picturesque scenery.As an Italian and fan of Denzel Washington, it was really entertaining to watch Denzel Washington sitting at the cafe, talking broken Italian, making friends, getting familiar with the people and the quiet atmosphere of the town. I found the representation of the town and of the people authentic, very well done, and not too stereotypical. The Italian language is real Italian spoken by Italian actors, the accents are real, the film is shot in different Italian towns on the Amalfi coast, and so on. One can see the great attention to detail and care that was put into the making of this movie, which I mentioned above about the directing. I did have a ""what?!"" moment, though, that I could not wrap my head around: Aminah (Gaia Scodellaro) takes McCall on a tour of the village, by telling him that she'll help him discover the authentic food specialties of the town. As they go on a stroll and talk, they pass by some food stands, and Aminah shows McCall different authentic Italian dishes. Then, however, she invites him to grab a Kebab (great, but not Italian at all!), which he does! Seriously, what happened there? There was all that nice fish and stuff, too-why a Kebab??I have read a lot of criticism about the action in this movie, especially about it being too little. The problem that I see with the action is with the fact that McCall is never really challenged by any of his enemies rather than with the length of the action scenes. In other words, none of the villains or his men are even close to Robert McCall's level, so it seems quite easy for him to take them down in creatively brutal ways. This applies, unfortunately, also to the ending of the movie, which is, anyway, very very powerful. Also, the non-action parts build the tension between McCall and the villain, and they are not boring at all.Another weak point of the movie, from my point of view, has to do with some of the supporting characters and their relationship to the hero (McCall). Dakota Fanning's character (CIA) could have been a very good helper in the fight against the mafia, but instead she ends up not doing so much at all... Along with that, one aspect of McCall being in this town is the attachments that the townspeople form with him, but we actually don't have much evidence of this beyond him eating in a cafe once in a while. We do see McCall having an emotional response when they are threatened, we do see him getting comfortable in the town, but while a deeper layer to that is mentioned, the viewer doesn't directly witness this: for example, when McCall says that the people of the town brought him peace, or that he understood that this is the place where he belongs. All these sentiments sound a bit out of place and don't match the level of interactions that we as viewers have witnessed. We expect some deeper character development to happen in the ""kebab""/walks scene, but the dialogue between McCall and Aminah doesn't actually build to anything relevant.Overall, a very good and extremely brutal vigilante movie, with some weaknesses, very well shot, with a fantastic Denzel Washington doing very badass things. Worthwhile final chapter, 7 stars!","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","stevendbeard","2 September 2023","I saw The Equalizer 3, starring Denzel Washington-The Magnificent Seven_2016, Man on Fire; Dakota Fanning-Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Man on Fire; Remo Girone-My Name is Vendetta, Ford v Ferrari and Andrea Scarduzio-Mission: Impossible_Dead Reckoning Part One, Dark Crossing.This is the third-and supposedly, final-entry in the saga of Robert McCall, the retired government assassin that helps people in need when they have no other options. By the way, all three movies are based on the 1985 tv series starring Edward Woodward, not the current Queen Latifah one. The first movie was in 2014 and the second was in 2018, all starring Denzel as Robert McCall. This one starts with Denzel at a farmhouse in southern Italy. He is retrieving a set of keys from some very bad guys. FYI: You learn later what the keys are for. Just as Denzel is thinking that he can settle down in a small Italian town, he learns that his actions have set off a series of events with some other very bad guys, called the Mafia. Andrea is their local representative and he is not a happy camper. Remo plays the local doctor that helps Denzel when he gets into some trouble and Dakota is the C. I. A. Agent that gets involved in Denzel's wake.It's rated R for strong bloody violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.If you liked the previous movies, you should enjoy this one, too. I did and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","eysona","13 October 2023","Equalizer 3 marks the epitome of vigilante action, masterfully directed by Antoine Fuqua and led by the indomitable Denzel Washington as Robert McCall. This finale exudes a riveting blend of vengeance and virtue, set against the picturesque yet perilous backdrop of Southern Italy, a departure from the urban sprawl we're accustomed to from its predecessors.The narrative unfolds with a sinister Sicilian mobster's world coming undone, an ode to McCall's relentless quest for justice. Washington's embodiment of a righteous avenger resonates with a sense of authenticity that is as engaging as it is awe-inspiring. His transition from a humble dweller to a harbinger of retribution is seamless, affirming his prowess in action-heavy roles, despite the generational gap with contemporary action stars.The film doesn't shy away from delivering a gleefully violent spectacle, with each punch thrown and bullet fired reverberating the core essence of McCall's crusade against the unyielding Sicilian Mafia. The atmospheric tension is palpable, bearing the signature touch of Fuqua's directorial finesse. Amidst the relentless action, what shines through is McCall's affinity for the innocuous folk of his newfound haven, accentuating the dichotomy of his violent endeavors and his quest for tranquility.Equalizer 3 also subtly explores McCall's coping with the ghosts of his past, while forging ahead on a merciless path of retribution. Though the subplot involving Emma, a young CIA analyst, leaves something to be desired, it doesn't detract from the film's core narrative.The narrative rhythm is maintained with meticulous care, ensuring a robust pace that keeps the adrenaline pumping, yet providing those moments of reflection, showcasing a meditative side amidst a storm of violence.In closing, Equalizer 3 isn't just a movie, it's an experience that leaves you at the edge of your seat, yet introspective about the dichotomy of good and evil, and the lengths one goes to uphold justice. The film is a fitting closure to a saga that has enthralled audiences with a raw depiction of vigilante justice, embodied by an actor who continues to defy age and expectations in delivering compelling performances.","1/10"
"The Equalizer 3","zeeshanabid","4 October 2023","Equalizer 1 is one of my most favorite movies of all times. So the bar was already very high for the second part - which was kind of disappointment, but was still not extremely bad. This part, however, is atrocious. I really don't understand all these 10/10 ratings here. Even 7 is overrating for this piece of trash. There is no story and no action, and really, it's an extremely boring movie. If you're really into watching Denzel drinking his tea/coffee, watch the movie, as this is what he's doing in about 50% of the movie. And in rest of most of the movie he's just walking here and there for showing us some scenary. If we skim the movie's real material it will be a total of les than 15 minutes, 5 minutes of which was action. The script was for a short movie I think but they made it into a long movie.","10/10"

I like Denzel Washington movies so I was simply happy to see him again on the big screen. E1 & 2 were really enjoyable to watch. E3 left me thinking I'd like to see #4, but then at the end of the movie, I thought it'd be fine to not see another one. E3, imo, was so good I could leave it here. As one reviewer posted, ""Denzel is so damn cool""...yep, there's no doubt about that. While E3 is different from the other 2, it is well-written, kept me guessing and as usual Denzel doesn't ""act"", he ""is"". What's next for Mr. Washington? Dunno, but I hope he doesn't wait years to bring it to the big screen again.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","ItsRobinTV","31 August 2023","Don't get me wrong the movie was great! Even though Denzel Washington isn't the youngest any more his action scenes are brutal and just awesome to watch.The problem is that the movie has very few action scenes with Denzel and literally 20 minutes after his first real Purge against the bad guys we get to the final showdown, which doesn't feel like one, and then we are left feeling like we are still in the 2nd Act because a lot is still very unclear especially concerning the mafia.To see such a week ending/3rd Act after the amazing ending/3rd Act of the 2nd one is pretty disappointing, however balances the best opening from this trilogy which results in a good but nothing more movie.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Holt344","26 September 2023","This film has Denzel Washington reuniting with Dakota Fanning after having worked together nearly 20 years ago in Man on Fire, they had chemistry back then and it's nice to see them as scene partners again. The Equalizer 3 is the final part of the trilogy and is once again directed by Antoine Fuqua who produced it alongside a handful of others, including Denzel Washington.Robert McCall finds himself at home in Southern Italy but he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia.""Are you good or bad?"" a question McCall can't answer which is a good thing. The thing is, he's as grey as you can be. Feeling no empathy for the people in organized crime he brutally kills, whilst feeling empathy for others who are kind. Throughout these three movies we have seen him do some truly horrific things to other human beings, yet we're still voting for him, and you clearly see he has lost all hope in the beginning when he gets shot by that kid and decides to put the pistol against his temple and pull the trigger, thinking he had bullets left. That's a strong scene and what comes after that? Him turning his life around with three characters which inspires him and improves him as a person; Remo Girone as Enzo Arisio, Gio Bonucci and Gaia Scodellaro as Aminah. The first two were the stand outs for me, great performances! Another performance worth talking about is of course Dakota Fanning as Emma Collins, the reveal at the end with her actually being the daughter of Robert's late handler Susan Plummer which was a nice way of closing the chapter of McCall's life along with his new life in Altamonte.The Equalizer 3, what are my thoughts on it? The conclusion of a trilogy which I've loved since the first film, yet never met the same quality as the first Equalizer film. At its best, it comes close to that same quality. The action is where my expectations are high and if you watch it, you'll probably find yourself in my shoes, satisfied. With Denzel Washington headlining the film and Antoine Fuqua in the director chair, this duo is incredible and as great as ever in this film. Fuqua knows how to direct action, also thriller with realism. I just love the partnership they have, also the one he shares with Robert Richardson, the cinematographer, which is their second cooperation. Editor, Conrad Buff, is another person who has collaborated on multiple projects. The pacing is great and overall, the editing is spectacular. Honestly, I thought it was a satisfying conclusion and a terrific action thriller. Denzel Washington is as great as ever in the role, giving something new to the role, also the character aging is noticed and I think they handled that nicely. The writing was great, I really liked it. I thought it could have been longer because of how the ending felt a little bit rushed. The mise-en-scene was terrific, each scene was beautifully shot and directed. The tension and suspension was there from beginning to end which is impressive because of how the pacing is, it's quite slow which is the reason why I have liked these films so much. You get to know the characters, see how well written they are, especially Robert McCall. The story was really good, possibly the most emotional one yet. I really liked it being set in Italy, made sense with the Camorra. This was a satisfying conclusion to The Equalizer Trilogy, a great action thriller.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Top_Dawg_Critic","2 September 2023","All this third and final installment was, the same old story but in a different setting, with much less action, and a pointless walking cane that saw zero action. Washington carries the film and is impressive as always, but the writing was way more formulaic, cheesy, with lots of plot holes and ridiculous sub plots riddled with cliches. To make matters worse, Fuqua's choice to have the film set in beautiful Italy failed when most of the film needed English subtitles that took away from appreciating the Italian settings and landscapes, and the subtitles weren't on the screen long enough (not everyone is a speed reader) to make out what dialogue was being spoken in Italian. Technically, this was an Italian film with maybe 10% spoken English, and spending so much time reading subtitles took away from the entertainment value. Nevertheless, Denzel did what Denzel does and did it very well, and is the only reason to see this film.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Leofwine_draca","8 January 2024","This sequel is the third and least of the series and marks a big drop in quality from the level of the first two. Those ones were action-packed rivals to JOHN WICK, while this is much lower budgeted and feels somewhat half-hearted given what's come before. Denzel Washington is feeling his age for the first time, routinely doubled in the film's few action sequences, and barely showing up at all for the disappointing climax. The first half is all slow build and quite engaging with it, the gangster threat nicely menacing. But the second promises so much and disappoints with a lazy and generic showdown. Denzel can only do so much, after all.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Vivekmaru45","4 October 2023","I saw the first in 2014 and nine years later, hopefully, the conclusion to this trilogy. The main emphasis of these movies are crime and punishment. The Equalizer is like a person who punishes evil people who are beyond the reach of the law. There are so many movies like these that I will not even begin to recommend which ones for you to see. Denzel Washington is a great favorite actor of mine. I've seen countless films of his, some very good like Fallen(1998) and Deja Vu(2006). He has acted in diverse films spanning many genres. He is an actor that can make you smile or cry depending on the role he is portraying.This movie is basically just an all out war between Denzel's character Robert McCall and the Mafia. So you would typically expect over-the-top violence and action. And this is where director Antione Fuqua excels. Training Day(2001) and Tears Of The Sun(2003) are two excellent movies of his.Verdict: if you want to complete watching the trilogy then go ahead. However for me this is nothing but repetitious action and acting. If you've seen all the 80's action classics like First Blood(1982), Commando(1985), Raw Deal(1986), The Delta Force(1986), Die Hard(1988), Red Heat(1988) then give this one a skip.","8/10"

"The Equalizer 3","moviemanmo973","1 September 2023","This is the worst film in the trilogy. The best part of this film is that it takes place on the beautiful Almalfi Coast. The music was also decent but otherwise this film was a bore. The action is limited to about 3 sequences. The opening action sequence which is shown in the trailers is the best one out of all of them.The villains are the most clich√© villains ever that don't ever truly feel like a threat. All of the characters were very weak and unmemorable.The story was just uninteresting which made things worse since there was hardly any action.This is a very disappointing ending to this trilogy. Don't waste your time.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","onpointmag","5 September 2023","I love me some Denzel Washington, God knows I do, but this is my least favorite movie with him starring in. Not because of him, but because they did waaaay too much! For starters did the camera person really need to spend the 1st five minutes of the movie walking past dead bodies. We got the point! Denzel (aka Robert McCall) killed them all. (Sorry Fuqua, you are an exceptionally talented director & the body of work you put on the big scree is awesome, believable work) But (in terms of writing) an overload of dead bodies alone, does not make a great story. A great turn of events does. Anyway... No one will probably admit it but the story line was long & unengaging. In the first two movies Denzel was a person with heart, spirit, and influence. In EQ3 he's no more than a menace, a vigilante. His killing started before we even knew why. It also seem like they weren't quite sure if they wanted to write this movie as an action flick, an emotional drama, or a travel blog and just show all the beautiful buildings, food & culture of Italy. I loved the first two installments, but this is blase at best. No wonder during an interview when the host told Denzel she was surprised to see him make a 3rd sequel, Denzel said, he thought Robert McCall had run his course too, but ""apparently they felt McCall still had work to do"". It's almost like he felt his presence in the movie was an after thought too... cause that's exactly how I felt watching it. Sure, he was in every scene, but his presence wasn't valuable enough, if you ask me. Still, I love Denzel. He hasn't loss a thing. The man commands the screen & is still one of the best actors to ever exist.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","kuner-59029","4 October 2023","The Equalizer 3 is a strange film, so strange that I wonder how it was greenlit in the first place.The entire film takes place in Italy, and about 85% of the dialogue is in Italian. One has to admire them for doing this. It's always ridiculous in films when Russian or Italian gangsters suddenly speak English with each other. They went for realism in the language department.However, the rest of the film feels like a slow, horrible, surreal fever dream. Right off the bat the color grading jumps out at you. The colors are so desaturated, they may as well have filmed in black and white. The film opens with a landscape shot of Sicilily, and it looks like some brown-yellow-greyish mess, similar to the movie 300, but without that film's comic book stylings and bursting earthen red tones.Anyone who has ever been to Italy can attest to it being a very colorful country with usually great weather and the sunlight bringing out popping colors. Here it looks like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. This stands in stark contrast to the harmonious life the film is trying to portray.The depictions of Italians is a caricature and could be considered racist.For one, the Film depicts Italy as a crime ridden hellhole run by sadistic gangs that terrorize the people and the police, cut off people's hands, torture them, even bomb the police. It's a joke. Italy is one of the safest countries in the world. Even Germany's murder rate is twice as high. The US's murder rate is 12 times as high!I've worked in Italy multiple times and had run ins and dealings with the Mafia. They're scum. But not like in the movie.They portray Italians as tranquil peasants, sitting at cafes and wearing 1950s clothing, sitting there like sheep passing the time, waiting for mafia thugs to come and terrorize them. A scene at a school depicts the children wearing school uniforms. This hasn't been the case in Italy since Mussolini.The mafia are portrayed as thugs on motorcycles with face tattoos, who in broad daylight loot a hotel, terrorize people (a cop even) in restaurants, and feel more like stereotypical Hollywood Russian mob hitmen.In reality, the Mafia works almost entirely behind the scenes via corruption. They're invisible. They're not street thugs with face tattoos. They work in city administration, customs, transportation, construction. They mainly syphon public funds away by having controlling interests everywhere and putting people in power on their payroll (or sometimes intimidating them).In my personal case, our business had to pay bribes to the actual police. Multiple times. They threaten you with some bulls**t code violation and openly tell you they will shut you down for a few weeks and drag things out, so it's cheaper to just pay them.The Mafia would never lay hands on a policeman or cut the hand off of a chief of police like in the movie. The idea that a crime family can intimidate police is laughable. The police in Italy are as militarized as everywhere else in the world. Just a bit more corrupt. Thugs in uniform. No one in their right mind would mess with them. There's no profit in that.The mafia has its hands in everything, but they don't go around randomly butchering people, raping their children and other things alluded to in this film.So all that said, the Italy depicted here is a fantasy Italy, much like the fantasy Sparta and Persia in the aforementioned 300.I'm not faulting the film for having a fantasy setting, but if you have a fantasy setting, this should be reflected in the tone. V for Vendetta, 300, Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, Braveheart, there are tons of examples of films that distort reality to fit the tone of the story.But the tone of Equalizer 3 is... a mess. What tone were they even going for?A political spy thriller involving the Mafia, ISIS and corruption? Too unrealistic and silly.An hommage to a gritty 70s Italo crime thiller? Too sombre for that.A sombre drama? The story's too simple and the characters too thin for that.A Liam Neeson style silly violent power fantasy? Too slow and not enough action.The film lacks a coherent tonal language. The only thing that is consistent is the violence. This film is not just gory, but sadistic. While movie violence doesn't shock me anymore, in this case it still appalled me. The film revels in people being slaughtered. It's shot in a semi realistic way, but absolutely glorified. Eyes are stabbed, limbs broken until the bones exit the wounds, people are crushed by cars, hacked in the face with meat cleavers... you get the idea. One scene even depicts a killing spree in first person view like a video game. This film has no moral compass, because it presents the violence a human misery in these desaturated, naturalistic colors, while at the same time glorifying it as if it were an awesome video game killstreak.Despite all the gore, the violence is still played safe. Only men and mostly only the bad guys get it. The scene where the mafia beats up the cop in his apartment in front of his wife and daughter would have been far more effective, if they had forced him to watch them beat the wife or even daughter. But they don't get so much as a scratch. The movie tries to be hard, but chickens out where the violence would actually be shocking instead of just abrasive.As a filmmaker you have a choice when it comes to violence. You can make it cartoony and fun (i.e. Robocop), or you can go the Saving Private Ryan / Schindler's List route, keep it realistic and shocking, and focus on the suffering to tell a story. This combines the two in the worst way: Focus on the suffering and misery and present it as cool. It's akin to putting Heavy Metal over the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan.Like many modern low budget films, the pacing is extremely slow. Long shots of people walking through halls, entering rooms or exiting cars pad the run time. With tighter editing, it could have been 25 minutes shorter.These are some major flaws. It doesn't help that the story is stupid, paper thin and unrealistic.However, the movie does have some undeniable qualities in terms of craftsmanship. Denzel Washington steals every scene he is in. He is supremely talented, and breathes life into his character with many little quips, little smiles, nods, the way he moves his eyes, tilts his head. There's a lot of subtlety going on.The scene with him and the CIA agent at a caf√© is a highlight in terms of both writing and acting. The dialogue is sharp and full of wit, and Denzel manages to be curteous, unassuming and dangerous at the very same time.Some of the scenes with him and the locals like the doctor or the policeman are extremely well acted as well. If you're a fan of his, you will get your money's worth. He used to be in a lot of big films, and it's a shame to see him relegated to smaller productions recently. He still feels like he could helm intelligent blockbusters like he did 30 years ago.Instead we get this.","1/10"

"The Equalizer 3","jtsteve-85230","11 September 2023","This was definitely the worst out of the trilogy. It lacks the action that you definitely associate with The Equalizer, even if the opening seemed to be especially brutal. In fact, much of the movie doesn't really strike me as a film that Antoine Fuqua had much involvement in. McCall doesn't seem to scan the environment for weapons or even do much of what the title implies he does. Ninety percent of the film is him spending time in a small town just hanging out with the locals, with Mafia thrown in for a couple of scenes as an afterthought.That, and half of the film seems to focus on Dakota Fanning's character, who isn't really interesting enough to hold your attention for a terrorism subplot that serves as an afterthought.That, and the movie just ends on an anti-climax that wasn't exactly riveting. The fact most reviews on here are giving this movie 8 or 9 stars is wildly suspicious. That being said, Denzel gives his all, as always, and still ends the movie as an interesting character, as always.","1/10"
"The Equalizer 3","TxMike","15 March 2024","Seems every four or five years Denzel Washington makes an 'Equalizer' movie, starring as Robert McCall. I just re-read my review of the first one, McCall as a character doesn't change much, just the situations he finds himself in, and the techniques he uses to eliminate the bad guys.In real life Washington has been vacationing to Italy for over 30 years so that setting was a natural for this movie. McCall considers himself 'retired' and he finds the community of Altamonte and its towns folk to his liking. He is thinking this may just be the place to settle down.Breaking the peace are an Italian mafia family, dealing in drugs, and ruthlessly brutal to any that cross them. McCall witnesses some of them brutally mistreating some of the innocent merchants, this bothers him terribly, he formulates a plan to set things right. Part of his plan involves getting Dakota Fanning as CIA agent Emma Collins on the path of the crime family.This movie is not high art, it uses pretty standard 'good guy vs bad guy' tropes. One reviewer even says it is 'The Magnificent Seven Minus Six', and that is a pretty good comparison. But it is entertaining, and that is the only point of a movie like this. I think most of us find it easy to cheer an 'equalizer' putting the really bad guys in their place.At home on DVD from my public library.","7/10"

Very disappointed.The love story was very weak and he seemed out of place.The bad guys were poorly setup and didn't even appear that dangerous or scary.All in all, it was a very disappointing experience that I regretted taking part in and wish that I had spent my time watching something else. I think even Barbie had more action than this.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","view_and_review","26 February 2024","We already know that with action movie sequels they have to have more action. Usually that's more explosions, more gun play, more fighting, and a higher body count. E3 did go for more, but it was more brutality. And it was good.Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is now in Italy. His soft heart and sleuthing brought him there where he would single-handedly take down a criminal family. But, unlike the Godfather, he left alone a child who shot him in the back. He would then spend the next few weeks in a small town in Sicily rehabbing and subsequently finding another group of horrible people needing an attitude adjustment.While he was in Italy so was a CIA operative named Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning). For those that don't know, Denzel and Dakota were paired together 20 years ago in arguably Denzel's best vigilante movie: ""Man on Fire."" In E3 Denzel didn't have to save Emma directly, but he did help her in more ways than one.I liked the change of scenery for E3. They went away from Boston to the very picturesque and idyllic scenery of southern Italy. If ""The Equalizer 3"" did anything it made me want to visit Italy. The aerial shots of the vineyards and seaside village were better than any footage I've seen in any movie featuring Italy. The area was so beautiful and serene it seemed sinful that blood was spilled on its streets.If E2 took a step back from the first Equalizer, then E3 regained the footing. It was again more personal and focused. There was an increase in gore as if Robert had lost his patience dealing with bad guys. Naturally, he needed to be efficient, but he also needed to be more deadly if for any reason than his age. He can't have much fight left in him, so he needs to take care of his enemies quickly.It would seem apropos that The Equalizer would finish up in 2023 when it seems that John Wick has also finished up. Both began in 2014 (seems a lifetime ago), and even though John Wick has one more sequel than The Equalizer, they find themselves finishing up at the same time. Take care of yourself Robert MCCall.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Uriah43","4 January 2024","This film begins in Sicily with a former CIA assassin named ""Robert McCall"" (Denzel Washington) killing a number of men involved with drug trafficking and laundering money for a Middle Eastern terrorist organization. Having completed his mission, he then takes some money that was stored in the house and calmly walks out. However, upon doing so, a young boy suddenly emerges with a rifle and shoots him in the back. Although seriously wounded, he manages to escape in his car before eventually losing consciousness on a ferry headed back to the Amalfi Coast. Upon awakening, he finds himself being treated for his wounds by a small-town doctor named ""Enzo Arisio"" (Remo Girone) who graciously allows him to stay in his house until he can sufficiently recover. Grateful for this opportunity, Robert uses this time to stroll around the village and meet the people who live there--eventually being accepted as one of their own. He finally feels at home. Unfortunately, he then discovers that his new friends are being terrorized by a notorious crime family--and he knows what he has to do. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this film was a definite improvement over its immediate predecessor due in large part to the human element and the manner in which the characters interacted with one another. Likewise, the beautiful Italian scenery also enhanced the overall effect as well. Be that as it may, although this film isn't quite as good as the original film in the series, it was entertaining in its own right, and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.","8/10"

The movie takes it time developing the story but after a while it doesn't know where to go with it. It's a fun ride most of the way but it wraps things up in a rather unsatisfying way. It's a great looking movie with terrific location photography and Denzel Washington does a nice job but the script lets him down. I've seen all three Equalizer movies, including this one, in the theater (today I was at AMC Raceway 10, Westbury, NY).

"The Equalizer 3","ethanbresnett","30 August 2023","Denzel Washington teams up with Antoine Fuqua once again, returning to the role of Robert McCall in a solid albeit relatively formulaic threequel.The story finds McCall in Italy, where he attempts to find a semblance of peace after settling in a welcoming community. However it isn't long before the mafia starts to threaten this peace, leading McCall to flex his vigilante muscles once again.If that doesn't necessarily sound like an overly original story it's because it isn't. It follows the same story beats of most 'one man army' type films like John Wick, Taken etc. That's not to say the story is bad. It is perfectly serviceable and delivers what you'd expect, but it doesn't go beyond that.Thankfully the performance of Denzel Washington stops the film feeling overly generic, as he once again conjures up an intriguing protagonist in Robert McCall. His ability to effortlessly switch from charm and charisma to steely and calculated is brilliant to watch. He is just very believable in the role which really grounds the film.As well as this, Dakota Fanning gives a good performance and is perhaps underutilised. Her story thread does feel a little underdeveloped in truth, and maybe should have been fleshed out or dropped entirely.Speaking of being fleshed out, the villains of the piece are as generic as they come. A little more work here would have been appreciated just to add a but more interest.The action that is served up in the film is good but perhaps a tad sparse. A couple of extra sequences or an extension to the existing ones would have been welcome, and would have also helped the pacing slightly, which does feel a little off.Overall The Equalizer 3 is a pretty good ride. Antoine Fuqua doesn't push the boat out too much but he pulls together an enjoyable and engaging film that will be sure to entertain.","7/10"

I always preferred the john wick franchise over it.This one was not necessarily bad, it was alright but it feels off for some reason and it felt kinda boring, a lot of elements were missing from the previous ones such as the iconic scanning and going into Robert's head and the time counting.This one also felt long as it didn't feel like a three act film but a film with just one long act that takes the span of 2 hours.The story was kinda decent and the fight scenes were still great but I wanted to see more, the only thing that held this film apart was the scenes with Denzel, I legit didn't care about the side characters and other stuff.I still recommend watching it though.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Neptune165","2 December 2023","I love Denzel. Best Actor of all time in my opinion. I also like the other equalizer films quite a bit. The first one was a way to show us who the character is and just how skilled he is. The point of the first one was his struggle to re-enter back into the life he had sworn to leave. The second film, our protagonist had a lot to fight for. There was significant adversity in the antagonists he was up against. This third film really didn't have a whole lot of tension. What was supposed to be the problem in this film that our protagonist has to overcome? (Spoilers) He got shot by the kid at the beginning of the film, which was leading me to believe that they were going to go for a ""Even if you take the lives of people who do terrible things, you'll still end up being the villain in someone's story"" type of angle, which is a good one. However, we never hear from the kid again, and he just absolutely stomps a mafia ring without much trouble at all. There was no opposing force that created any type of resistance for our protagonist. Of course the fight scenes are always fantastic, but yeah that's my two cents on this one. Wish there was more to the story than just ""ok he lives happily ever after in Italy now yay"". Also all of this aside, it was beautifully directed, and the actors did a fantastic job with the story they had been given.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","isantistao","5 November 2023","If you are expecting this to be better than the other two, don't set yourself up for dissapointment. I know, I know, it certainly should be the best of the 3...after all, it takes place in Italy with the real Italian Mafia...but yet somehow there is much less action than the other 2! There are hardly any fight scenes. There's really only 2 scenes that could be called fight scenes, and the fighting is short and involves little choreography. Basically the type of action that you wish to see when you watch a movie like this is almost entirely absent, the opposite of what it should be. Which is frustrating. And that's not the only frustrating part of the movie. Another frustrating part is its predictability and how everything seems to happen just right for the main character. Speaking of which, another frustrating part is how unrealistic it is when this is happening. Which leads me to another frustrating part, which is the unrealistic portrayal of how a man like him would experience Italy, a place known for being rude to outsiders, and especially racist towards black people...yet somehow he experiences no racism, or even rudeness at all, and gets instantaneously welcomed into a community of people who somehow speak perfect english. It's super weak, lame, and frustrating. Not necessarily a bad film. It's scenic and has good cinematography, so it looks nice. It just has really weak writing and non-existent choreography except for those 2 fleeting scenes that can hardly be called fight scenes at all. The story is just so lacking. It seems this trilogy started strong and only got weaker with each installment, which again, is the opposite of how it should be. And the ending of this final film was very anti-climactic too. The main character basically just took down an entire mafia family like knocking down domino's, without sustaining any injuries, or even taking a punch, because there was no fighting what so ever as he was doing it. And then the movie just ended before there could be any retaliation, or seeing what happened to him after he did it. It's just so lame. I'm so disappointed. I'm giving this a 5 because I'm being generous since it wasn't that bad, but it certainly wasn't a good action movie.","1/10"

So of course he gets shot in the back and wakes up in a wonderfull village at the shore in sicilly and a doctor and policemen just fix him without asking questions... ok... He's trying to drink tea and is mocked for it but as he recovers he is getting best friend with the locals. We are 1 hour and 15 minutes in the movie and what happened? Kinda nothin... except some mafia goons harrassing the locals. In the end they try to force in some action but it just doesnt feel rigth. Denzel kills everyone without any kind of trouble he is just in god mode and erradicades everything in sigth. But somehow out of your sigth most of the time. As I said in the beginning I didn't expect much but cmon watching a white wall probably would be more entertaining than this...","6/10"

I didn't have high hopes for this.However it delivered, the settings were beautiful, it was actually a more fresh idea and didn't feel like the exact same movie with a coat of paint like the taken franchise or others became. It made you care about randoms and that was good.It went really fast which is an excellent sign, the female agent was great, I'm all for women in roles but just get the casting right! They did here.Fight scenes were awesome, the sounds were even better, so much better than the JW style, it's just a great film where you can escape reality.","6/10"

The more violent the better the film. They didn't understand that it's the story is what makes the film, understanding the how when and why of the characters and their world.So this offering is really really violent but without justification. Even why McCall is in Italy is only lamely and glibly explained at the end of the film.Shame and waste of opportunity .Would I watch again ? No (but i would and have the previous 2 films)","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Screen_O_Genic","13 September 2023","Robert McCall is a former marine and spy who finds himself in Sicily on a mission. Events unfold and he ends up confronting and taking on the Italian Mafia. My first foray into the Equalizer universe, this is one Action flick with your usual fistfights, gunshots, mutilations and explosions. One thing that stands out here is the talk. The slow burn chatterbox style of build-up in a film like this which usually never works is on full display and it sure weighs, slows and drags. The story is a fantasy in the vein of ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" where a bald, overweight oddball accomplishes what the entire Italian police force fails to do and brings the Italian Mafia to its knees and lives to tell the tale. The backdrop of Sicily in its old time vintage grime adds sordid splendor to the sketchy plot and erratic pace. Denzel Washington looked like he was doing a job in this flick and you'll feel like you're going through one seeing this to the end. Watchable and nothing to write home about this is a sleeper of the year.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","heisenberg83","1 September 2023","Something missing from this one - any light or fun or even a glint of excitement. It's like a Christopher Nolan Batman movie but even more dark and miserable, imagine if directed by Darren Aronofsky. The violence is unending and brutal, I'm surprised this took just a 15 rating in UK cinemas. I remember getting some thrills, fun and excitement from the first two Equalisers but didn't take any from this. By the time Denzel takes out the final villain, I felt woe for humanity of this is what's deemed entertainment these days. Maybe I'm getting old but I'll stick with classics like Dirty Harry and Death Wish thanks.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","SnoopyStyle","4 October 2023","In Sicily, crime boss Lorenzo Vitale and his son are returning home to find lots of dead bodies. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is being held prisoner but not for long. After more killings, he is wounded but escapes. He finds safety in a city threatened by other criminals. He calls the CIA and gets operative Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning).Denzel Washington is doing super-fighting and director Antoine Fuqua is bringing his cinematic style. The partnership continues to be solid although the movie franchise keeps drifting away from the original TV premise. This could be any number of avenging vigilante ex-spy superhero. Let's be honest. Denzel is almost seventy. It's less and less reasonable for him to still be super fighting. He needs to fight with experience and brains more than brawn. My favorite scene is the restaurant where he does exactly that. I'm fine with the general idea of a black John Wick or Jason Bourne. Denzel is probably aging out of that role. Everything else is fine. I didn't actually recognize Dakota Fanning although I kept thinking that she looks familiar. Denzel's age does keep bugging me throughout the movie.","6/10"

The while movie drops for me from all sides.Spoiler Alert!!!That moment in the square, people started to use phones, all together after a long encounter. A monster who just chopped the hand of a big city police chief, suddenly now worries from a protest of few citizens and cams? Speaking of which, is it that simple for a mafia head to chop off the hand of a police chief and send him publicly to hospital and gets away with it? The wholes story line and events take a drastic turn down in this movie. How unfortunate.The ending, i expected something at a bigger magnitude than the usual John Wick thing.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","yasinhussain-14721","30 August 2023","If you're an absolute action fanatic, and you're hoping to see plenty of it in this, lower those expectations now. While there are some fantastic action scenes at the beginning and end, the middle is where things really slow down. Literally like half of this movie is just showing McCall's ordinary day-to-day life in Sicily, which was to me, a very surprising decision by Antoine Fuqua, since anybody with a brain would know that an overwhelming majority of the moviegoers for this are gonna be die-hard action fans, yet this film possibly has the least of that out of the whole trilogy. But what annoys me the most is the fact that our protagonist, our *main* character, barely even has a role in the plot that unfolds. He starts and finishes the story, but other than that, he's almost entirely unnecessary! It's actually Dakota Fanning's character that keeps the story ticking along, and then every now and then Denzel Washington's character drops in a bit of key information to make it *seem* like he's majorly involved. And linking to this, where on Earth does he even get this information from? This was actually a recurring theme throughout the series (so not just in this sequel), but still, certain things just don't have any clear explanation, like for example, how did he figure out the bad guys' location? It doesn't at all make sense. All they had to do was show us how he managed to find out these elusive details and the movie would have flowed along nicely. But as a result of not doing this, it feels like the film untimely jumps straight into the action.But anyway, I'm talking way too negatively about a picture that I actually had a lot of fun with. Even though it does just mainly depict an old man going about his day in a friendly, sociable area of Italy, I strangely didn't get bored in the slightest, even though I could easily describe it as boring (if you can somehow understand what I mean). And the action sequences were epic, just as they were in the prequels to this. Not one bit dragged for me.In conclusion, whilst I'm ever so slightly disappointed that they didn't end on a big one, I am still very satisfied with my cinema trip, as it was a great feature to kick back to and take in.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","avindugunasinghe","8 December 2023","Though the more you see of McCall the more his adventures seem superficial, The interesting personality Denzel portrays is infectious. Great cinematography making the story evermore dramatic. Beautiful visuals of Italian city and culture. Excellent special effects.

Having been to small towns and villages I have experienced how locals can adopt you after a few days and how you will do anything for them. May not be the typical American Equalizer but great cultural integration. If you love travelling and integrating with different people then this will appeal to you.I know fans of the earlier two films will want to see more planning and action but the point of the film is that he has finally found where he belongs. Yes there is a leap of faith at the beginning from several characters to trust him but it still works. Dakota Fanning was also a good addition.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","steveinadelaide","3 September 2023","Denzel Washington as Robert McCall is back in THE EQUALIZER 3. But this time, he has decided to retire and settle in Southern Italy, enjoy a peaceful life, and make some local friends. Of course, as you would expect in an Equalizer movie, it doesn't stay quiet for long, and McCall discovers that his new friends are under the control of local crime bosses - and he wants to protect them.The Equalizer 3 gets off to a slow start, but by the second half of the movie, things pick up. Of course, the plot is predictable, and there is nothing original about it. The action scenes are well choreographed and intense, contrasting with the beautiful Southern Italy backdrop to what is going on.As usual, the tone of the movie is gritty, with rare moments of humour. Denzel Washington puts in a solid performance as Robert McCall. The rest of the cast is forgettable. The story superficially skates across themes of redemption, justice, and family. There's nothing new. I enjoyed the soundtrack, but it's standard stuff for an action movie. The dialogue is ok but doesn't have any memorable lines.I was entertained by Equalizer 3, but there's nothing much to be emotionally invested in, and it is a by-the-numbers action movie with lots of explicit violence. The theme of community and family probably resonated with me the most.If you are looking for an action movie to pass the time, particularly if you have seen the other two Equalizer movies, I'd check this out. But don't expect a groundbreaking film with original ideas. Take plenty of popcorn!","5/10"

Except for senseless and many brutal deaths, the dramaturgy is just worse.The film has no depth in either the characters or the story itself. The film is artificially lengthened by many unnecessary scenes that are unnecessarily long, as if you were stretching chewing gum.There is hardly any character building, the roles all seem very superficial and weak. You hardly learn anything about the new person in the film, many questions are not answered or only answered very vaguely.The screenwriters, directors of this story and the dramaturgy failed here.

"The Equalizer 3","thesar-2","7 September 2023","This Sorta-Senior-Bourne does not Equate the greatness of the first two and yet, still gets a solid recommendation. Only, catch it on streaming.While I really did have a good time here and cherished the baddies getting 10x more than they deserved, this is definitely a SKIP-theatres kind of movie. On the surface, it looks like it would have grand cinematography, but it really doesn't. They truly made an interesting and picturesque Italian village look dull and boring.""Retired"" Superspy Roberto McCall finally feels some of the pain he dishes out when he gets wounded during one of his many vigilante adventures. In about half the movie's time, he heals in a foreign land, gets warmly welcomed and has enough encounters with the local thugs, his mouth waters once more for vengeance.One thing that ultimately let me down was the lack of episodic ""heroism"" scenes. This was based on the weekly television action-drama of the 80s about an ex-CIA agent stealthy helping the needy and punishing the criminals. One thing they did great in both parts 1 and 2 was making you feel like you've seen a half-season worth of episodes/climaxes within the runtime. This was sadly absent in the supposed ""final chapter.""Instead, this boiled down to just two linked Italian Jobs. And for the majority of the movie, he's the ""getting too old for this stuff"" recovering patient. Most of this action movie is just as slow as the first chapter and while I did like the world-building/character-developing, I would have loved to see him more able than disabled. Plus, the story had all the beats you needed, they just weren't all felt.And yet...I did have fun. The small sparks of the old Robert McCall were really nice. I mean, Denzel Washington. The name says it. Even in his worst movies, he shines. And he still charmed me to death.I do love how consistent this franchise is. Yes, this was the weakest entry, but still dang enjoyable. Plus, I love how HARD-R this is. In the few kill-moments, Robert doesn't mess around. SOOO glad this wasn't PG13.Overall, if you liked the first two, there isn't a reason to not make this a trilogy night. And if you're worried about this going on too long, keep in mind: mercifully, each installment gets shorter and shorter.Listen up Hollywood, PLEASE make shorter movies. I really can't bare to go into another 3-hour movie, especially ones you already told us was just the first part of two. Egah, too long!***Final Thoughts: Not that long of a franchise, even though it's been going on for about a decade now, but here's my ranking:1. The Equalizer (2014) 4/5 Stars - Barely edges out #2, almost a tie.2. The Equalizer 2 (2018) 4/5 Stars.3. The Equalizer (2023) 3¬Ω/5 Stars.","10/10"

This movie also shows us the beauty of Italy and the Italian culture.Denzel Washingtons acting is superb. The way he acts by his face expressions,With his body language,by his looks and With his words is awesome to watch. Antoine Fuqua is a very talented director and in my opinion he has created a masterpiece.Fuqua directed both the Equalizer and the Equalizer 2 in an excellent way. All the Equalizer movies has different stories and maybee this is the most beutiful story of the three movies.The Equalizer 3 Its a great story who is getting personal for the wiewer and the message is:we can all contribute to do this world a better place.The filming is so good that it feels like you are two steps behind Mc Call and can follow every step he takes during the whole movie.Great acting also from Dakota Fanning and Remo Girone and from many others of the actors in this movie.Robert McCall is personifying a person who is doing this world a better place to be in and what we can learn from this movie is that we all can contribute to do this world a better place to be in.In this movie we get to know Robert McCalls human side more. We can feel how he like all human beeings are facing situations every day where he can choose to help others and then reap the joy to see others rejoice.Excellent movie who deserves to be watched many times!I hope that Robert McCall Will be back in Equalizer 4

"The Equalizer 3","olcare","10 October 2023","Denzel Washington makes it feel like he was born for this role, even elevating a simple movie.The film is primarily straightforward, easy to understand, and doesn't promise an exceptional script, but it does tie the series together well and doesn't diminish the entertainment.Of course, there are clich√©s, whether it's the peaceful town or the mafia, they're all clich√©s, but what stuck in my mind in the end wasn't the clich√©s.One of the simplest reasons I'd give this movie a 7 is the makeup. The makeup for the deceased and the CGI in the explosion scene was unexpectedly good; I genuinely applaud the entire team for this aspect.What I really wished for was a more complex storyline, a story that would grip us more, but I didn't feel too bad about how it ended.

And a pity for a great actor like Denzel Washington, forced to play the worn and sad roles of a once vigorous character.

This is where retired government assassin people go when they get old. At first, I was not a fan of one my favorite tv shows reimagined to an American character. I watched the prior two films before seeing this at an advanced screening. Only Denzel can turn what is essential a B movie action flick into a first rate thriller.This third movie brings humanity to the deadly enforcer and it gives the film a heart. Had there not been any films before this one, it could stand alone as it's own film. There's a very much deadly enforcer in this one who didn't get the memo about McCall so he simply doesn't care because he's just as badass.Action movie lovers will get their money's worth here as well as Denzel Washington fans of his ""thinking"" action hero.","5/10"

However, this latest one-come on, it felt like they were pushing it onto the audience.Denzel, well, he does make it look super cool and extra entertaining, but this one doesn't quite reach the level set by the first two editions.This is the reason for a bit of disappointment; you start watching with very high expectations, solely because of the brilliance of the first two parts. However, as you progress, you find that it doesn't quite measure up to the same standard. While the concept of taking the fight abroad was good, the plot, its presentation, and the failure to maintain the character tidiness while executing the action are among the reasons for my disappointment.Nevertheless, if you've seen the first two, it's worth watching the third, especially for Denzel.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","karthierocks","3 September 2023","I was really excited to see Denzel back in action and went to watch in theatres the first day itself but honestly it was bad. It had the nuance and potential to be a great concluding chapter in the Equalizer series but it didn't do the character any justice. Somewhere along the way, the director, Antoine Fuqua lost the charm of how he made the first Equalizer great: with riveting and inventive action that keeps you glued to the screen. This movie doesn't have that. The opening act was cool but after that, the movie goes stale and bland for a long time until the end of the second half but even the climax of the movie wasn't properly done. You can easily predict what would happen in the movie pretty easily and if you have watched the trailer, there's actually nothing more to be seen cause they have included all the good portions of the movie in the trailer. Thankfully I didn't watch the trailer and so atleast, that was an advantage for me but even then, the movie is simply put: boring. I've even liked the second movie but this one is really bad!

"The Equalizer 3","eddie_baggins","31 August 2023","Does the third entry in the Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington Equalizer series do anything you wouldn't expect or give you anything you wouldn't wish to receive? Absolutely not, but that's entirely the point in a surprisingly solid third outing for Washington's Robert McCall as he finds himself on a not so relaxing holiday to Italy.A much more entertaining and well-rounded outing than the trite second chapter that seemed to suggest McCall should stay retired for good, Equalizer 3 is the biggest step yet into exploitation territory, marked by a grisly opening act and a procession of gory yet also cartoonish violence that sees both Fuqua and Washington revel in the excesses of their over the top story that hides nothing about its true identity and wears it like a brand new hat from a clothing store.There's no doubt a film of this ilk is below someone as talented as Washington but it's also a guilty pleasure joy to see such a talented performer embrace such a simplistic yet uncomplicated outing that does what it says it will on the box and does it well and while Washington may here be teaming up with his Man on Fire partner Dakota Fanning as upstart government agent Emma Collins, this is very much the Washington show and a show he commands with a simply facial expression or a gun through the eye.Moving the McCall action from the United States to Italy is also a strong move for Fuqua's film with the seaside set locale in Southern Italy allowing for a lot of solid moments of eye candy around the cheese-riddled dialogue, the questionable friendship/romance arcs and side plots about kindly fisherman and while there may be less action than some might expect from a film brandished with the Equalizer name, when McCall gets going he makes it worth your time, gleefully dispatching Bond like baddies as if his a blood relative of John Wick, ensuring fans will be satiated with the carnage they are given.Unlikely to win any new fans, this old school action/thriller that feels like a product of a bygone era is a competent and effective genre offering that is unashamed of what it is and at all times aware of what it isn't, giving us an entertaining ""final"" chapter to the exploits of one of Washington's most over the top yet memorable characters.Final Say -A refreshingly old school action flick that's journey into exploitation cinema may surprise fans of the first two outings, The Equalizer 3 doesn't have a lot of depth or meat on its bones but thanks to a commanding Washington, a great location and some intense action, The Equalizer 3 is sure to appease.3 1/2 ice buckets out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","leevi-pettersson","9 September 2023","Considering that the two previous installments had been quite good ones(especially the first one), I had pretty high expectations for the movie. Unfortunately after watching it, I found myself feeling like I had been one of the bad guys in this movie, but with less gore.One has to wonder that if Fuque and Denzel were spending good time on the beautiful coast and decided that they might as well do a movie? So shallow and thoughtless it feels sometimes that even the fish in the movie might have problems swimming.One of the biggest issues of the film are relationships which Robert/o creates. When compared to the previous films, I found myself caring much less what happens to the people involved. For example in the first movie there was a lot of story arch for the young female character and you really felt it. Also it was clear to see how much Robert was struggling with his conscience. In this movie he appeared almost sadistic sometimes. In the second movie the character bonds were much stronger and the people were interesting. These ""civilians"" and criminals were way more one dimensional.As some of the previous reviewers have pointed out, we are starting to stretch the limits of imagination way too much. Obviously Robert has always been more or less fantasy character but this time we are taking things up to the notch. Also multiple scenes in the movie are not realistic at all or something what would really happen in the current criminal world. After all, this does not happen in Mexico or some parts of Africa or during the last century.The slow tempo did not really bother me and I liked Roberto having a plenty of cups of tea. Cinematography is the clear winner of the movie and Italy looks stunning, so much so that the country could consider hiring Antoine as a creator of travel ads. Music is quite good too but it makes me wonder what Harry could have achieved with this one.The film serie is known for it brutal action sequences but for those people who expect more of that, may feel like they have been gut punched by Roberto because after all, there is very little action and it's rather boring when compared to the previous films of the trilogy. The final action part is very disappointing and it almost feels like all the wine bottles were put into the basket of the beginning scene.I have been pondering between 5 and 6 but since we can't give half points, I have to rise it to 6 and there are indeed some redeeming qualities like the beautiful cinematography. But for those who are after more realism and depth in their dishes, this smells like an ""expired"" fish. So stick with the previous titles, you get more soul and some.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","arsalanweb","7 October 2023","The Equalizer 3 is an action-packed thriller that delivers on many fronts, earning a solid 7 stars out of 10. While the movie had its moments of excitement and intrigue, it did fall short in a couple of key areas, hence the slightly lower rating.Let's start with the positives. Denzel Washington once again shines in his role as Robert McCall, the enigmatic vigilante with a heart of gold. His performance is nothing short of stellar, and his portrayal of McCall's unwavering dedication to justice is a true highlight of the film. The action sequences, when they do occur, are intense and well-executed, showcasing McCall's lethal skills and resourcefulness.The storyline, though not groundbreaking, keeps you engaged throughout, as McCall embarks on another mission to right the wrongs of the world. The supporting cast also delivers commendable performances, adding depth to the characters and the overall narrative.However, where The Equalizer 3 falls short is in the absence of those iconic slow-motion scenes that have become synonymous with the franchise. These moments added a unique flair to the previous films, and their absence is certainly felt. Additionally, the film's pacing was a bit slow at times, causing certain scenes to drag on longer than necessary. Tightening up the editing and injecting more adrenaline-pumping action could have improved the overall viewing experience.In conclusion, The Equalizer 3 is a solid addition to the franchise, with Denzel Washington's magnetic presence and a compelling storyline. While it may not reach the heights of its predecessors due to the missing iconic slow-motion scenes and occasional pacing issues, it still delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant a 7-star rating. Fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this latest installment, and it's worth a watch for anyone seeking an action-packed evening at the movies.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","TMAuthor23","9 September 2023","Denzel Washington is one of those actors who raises a movie's quality and value just by being in it.Coincidentally, John Wick also walked off into the sunset not long ago. The characters share some DNA, but their worlds are entirely different. One borders on fantasy, this one tries to stay grounded in the real world.The setup is very long, with the script used to justify McCall's deep connection and commitment to the people of the small Italian village that has adopted him. The extra time spent on the brutality and arrogance of the Italian mafia boss is unnecessary, other than to create a desire to see him pay for his deeds.Dakota Fanning, paired with Washington for the first time since they preformed together in Man On Fire, provides a capable performance. The question that the plot made me think about though was this: as experienced and clued in as McCall clearly is, why doesn't he recognize the danger he attracts to people he is interested in when he starts waging a vigilante war? It's a plot point that creates some disconnects with his aggrieved portrayal. He creates the battle that he says he doesn't want to fight. Or maybe he does want the battle, so he can completely remove the violent threat to his New Haven.Equalizer 3 has a tenuous hold on reality, because, as happens with most action movies, the action sequences sometimes stretch the laws of physics. And for me, I find it very disturbing when a child is threatened in a script. For any reason.But ultimately, because Denzel Washington is an exceptional actor, and his character has significant backstory that we've seen in earlier films, Equalizer 3 wraps up the series in satisfactory fashion. The action is kinetic, Denzel provides the gravitas, and the story concludes with a definitive end point for McCall. A few threads from the original film are tied up too.As with most series like this, the original is the best. But a good actor is like a tide that that floats all boats.Recommended.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","CinemaSerf","31 August 2023","Anyone remember the little tune that went with the Edward Woodward television series? Well you won't hear it here in this rather procedural vehicle for Denzel Washington. His usually meticulous planning is compromised by a young lad with a rifle. This leaves ""McCall"" needing the care of a doctor ""Enzo"" (Remo Girone) in a small Sicilian town that is about to become the centre of the venal ambitions of ""Vincent"" (Andrea Scarduzio) and his henchman younger brother ""Marco"" (Andrea Dodero) who uses his team of thugs to extort from the local businesses. It's only a matter of time before heads clash and, well - you can guess the rest of this actually rather brutally predictable drama. Dakota Fanning appears now and again in a rather unnecessary sub-plot involving the CIA and some Syrian narcotics smugglers that is really undercooked - but for the most part this is really just Denzel being, well, Denzel on his quest to save his new-found friends from the grip of the unscrupulous Camorra. It's overlong for what it is, and I found Washington's performance to be rather sluggish throughout before a denouement that came across as rather simplistically rushed. It's fine, but forgettable.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","dps86","4 September 2023","So don't for a moment think that because Denzel Washington is getting older and that he is somehow loosing his touch, you would be sorely mistaken -- and the same can be said about the director. Antoine Fuqua, for they both have struck gold with this, the final installment of their spellbinding and riveting series based upon the television series in the mid-eighties of the same name. And, without giving anything away, you will learn Robert McCall connects back with some of his past adventures from their previous movies, and does so in ways that reflect the lead characters unwavering principles and make him even that much more a doer of good.Bravo.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","akcenat","2 December 2023","The latest 'Equalizer' is the third installment of the action thriller franchise starring Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, a former CIA agent who uses his skills to help people in need. However, this time, the movie fails to deliver the same level of excitement and suspense as the previous ones. The script is terrible, full of clich√©s, plot holes, and inconsistencies. The plot is unbelievable and unrealistic. The action scenes are over-the-top and lack logic, making the movie more suitable for a cheaper production of B movies. The only saving grace of the movie is Washington's performance, which is still charismatic and convincing, but not enough to save the movie from being a disappointment. Equalizer 3 is a letdown for the fans of the franchise and a waste of time for the viewers who expect a quality action thriller. I give it a 6.25 out of 10.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","eclarkdog","13 January 2024","I'm a bit surprised by the lowish rating. I found this third entry better than E2. Fanning and DW have a good screen chemistry after all these years since she was a child actress. Her role is really rather small, but adds a nice personal touch to the story, and their brief screen time is well done.Beautiful scenery, some brutal action, and a concise plot make for a very watchable action flick. I see quite a few reviews here saying the movie is boring. I don't get it. I was thoroughly entertained. Nothing is overly drawn out here. In fact, imo I would have liked to have spent more time in this beautiful Italian town getting to know the denizens a bit better.The opening sequence to the movie is excellent and sets up the plot. Denzel does his thing with a satisfy offing of the baddies and make the life of the good people better. It is everything you want from an Equalizer movie.","5/10"

"The Equalizer 3","talllwoood13","21 November 2023","Without subtitles good luck watching this and keeping up with the story. Granted it's not the toughest to follow plot in the world and they are in Italy so it makes sense but either way that was one huge complaint I had with this.Like the other movies the first scene sets a tone for what is to come. I love the human shield he does in the beginning of the film to shoot the last bad guy.I hated the location in this film. Italy I've been told is a beautiful place but this particular location It comes off as the most claustrophobic town in Italy. Nothing but narrow roads between buildings in an over populated little town where it feels weird to see people driving around in cars there. The only thing worst than this would be riding a subway in Tokyo during rush hour. The town is like a hot woman with really bad body odor. From far a perfect 10 but the closer you get to her. In this case closer to the town the more closer she'll etch towards a 1/10 because of how close everything is together. I'm sure 5 houses down could hear the toilet flush.How Denzel gets into the town and everything makes sense. The plot is over done but at least it didn't end the way certain other movies end where the whole town finally has enough and takes out the bad guy in the end. No it's not one of those.The CIA angle worked. However I struggled for the most part with this one for it to keep me interested. Even when they revealed the how and why he went to the first location in the beginning of the building I still didn't really care. I'm just glad Robert didn't fall in love with the only African looking woman in town if so I'd be insulted.I kind of hope this is the last Equalizer as I don't think anything else they get Robert to do would even be remotely interesting after this.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","jboothmillard","12 September 2023","It all started with the TV show starring Edward Woodward, then came the movie adaptation, which was alright, the sequel was pretty much the same standard, this third instalment was supposedly the conclusion to the trilogy, directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen, The Magnificent Seven). Basically, after arriving at a secluded winery in Sicily, criminal Lorenzo Vitale (Bruno Bilotta) slowly makes his way through the building, where he finds several henchmen have been brutally killed. When he finally enters the basement, he finds former Marine and Defense Intelligence Agency spy Robert McCall (Denzel Washington), being held at gunpoint by two of Vitale's bodyguards. McCall gives him the chance to leave alive, but Vitale tries to kill him, so McCall kills him and the rest of the gangsters. After walking out, he obtains a key to a vault at the winery and takes a bag full of stolen money from a cyber heist. While walking out into the courtyard, McCall is shot in the back by Vitale's adolescent Grandson (Adriano Sabrie). McCall considers suicide due to his injury but changes his mind and takes a ferry to the mainland. While driving on the Amalfi Coast, he pulls over, unconscious from shock, and is found and rescued by local carabiniere Gio Bonucci (Eugenio Mastrandrea). Bonucci brings him the remote coastal Italian town of Altamonte, where he is treated by small-town doctor Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone). McCall makes a slow recovery, walking with a cane and struggling to use the stairs. He forms friendships with the locals, including waitress Aminah (Gaia Scodellaro), and becomes fond of the town and its people. McCall makes an anonymous phone call to CIA officer Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning) to tip her off about the illegal drug trade disguised as business transaction that was taking place at the winery in Sicily. McCall's suspicions are confirmed when Collins and other CIA operatives find millions in cash along with bags of Captagon tablets hidden in a storeroom. McCall recognises he is being tracked when Collins appears, but he does not give clear answers when asked about his identity. Meanwhile, members of the Italian Mafia-type criminal organisation the Camorra harass and kill villagers trying to coerce them out of their houses and take over Altamonte for commercialisation purposes. McCall overhears high-ranking Camorra member Marco Quaranta (Andrea Dodero) pressuring local seafood storeowner Angelo (Daniele Perrone) to pay money he owes. As punishment and warning, Angelo's fish store is firebombed by the Camorra with the entire town helplessly watching. Bonucci watches a video of the firebombing and with Italian central police tries to track a van involved. Bonucci, his wife Chiara (Sonia Ben Ammar) and his daughter Gabriella (Dea Lanzaro) are attacked by the Camorra and beaten for interfering in their operations. Later, Marco and other gangsters demand that Bonucci set up a boat for them. McCall overhears this and requests them to move their operations to a different location. When Marco refuses, he kills him and his henchmen. The Naples head of police is threatened and tortured by Marco's brother Vincent (Andrea Scarduzio) to find who killed him. Collins' car rigged with a bomb by Vincent, but she escapes after McCall warns her. Vincent later threatens to shoot Bonucci in front of the entire town if McCall doesn't reveal himself. McCall walks out from the shadows, but before Vincent can kill him, the several of the townspeople record the ordeal on their camera phones. Vincent and the rest of the Camorra retreat but plan to return the following day. Later that night, McCall kills Vincent and his many bodyguards. The stolen money is returned to an elderly couple, their pension fund, by Collins on behalf of McCall. Back in Langley, Virginia, Collins receives a promotion for her role in ending the Altamonte drug trade. It is revealed she is the daughter of McCall's late handler Susan Plummer and her husband Brian. With the Quaranta brothers dead and all threats to the town eliminated, McCall is finally able to relax and celebrates a football tournament victory with the townspeople. Also starring David Denman as Frank Conroy, Salvatore Ruocco as Vincent's Man, and Alessandro Pess as Viking. Washington is well cast as the retired skilled agent and silently aggressive good Samaritan, and it is good to see him reunited with Man on Fire co-star Fanning, now grown-up and being reasonable as the CIA agent keeping tabs on him. It is the same basic formula; the lead anti-hero observes nasty men doing things to the innocent friends he has made and uses his ""particular set of skills"" to get rid of them, the fights and violence are good, otherwise it is just a standard slick enough action thriller. Worth watching!","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","searchanddestroy-1","6 December 2023","Of course EQUALIZER franchise belongs to the bad ass films genre, as those starring Steven Seagal, JCVD, Jason Statham and a couple of other not real actors for me. Except that, concerning EQUALIZER, Denzel Washington is a true authentic and talented actor who won the Academy Awards for TRAINING DAY, from the same director for whom he is his fetish actor; I mean Antoine Fuqua. The latest made this one, the third of the franchise. I am not usually fan of this kind of actionner where the lead always wins, is nearly never wounded or even ""touched"", never the slightest scratch. But I dont know why, I LOVE the EQUALIZER series, mainly because of Denzel who, as I just said before, can perfectly do far far better, totally different kind of characters - unlike JCVD, Seagal and Statham !!!! And the peculiarity of this franchise is that the stories are different in the plots, atmospheres. For instance the first involved the Russian mafia with an army of thugs, delightful villains, and a terrific body count; the second film was something different: only three or four bad guys, bad guys where one of them was a good family man for whom we could feel empathy.... Here, there is again new elements and another kind of story telling. The lead character - Washington - remains faithful to his role, so swindle for the audience, and the excitement is the same, with maybe less action scenes than usual, except the opening and last part of the feature. The Equalizer is better here than usual for my taste. I told you, this one doesn't look like the previous two, which were already not the same one to the other. I hope the franchise will proceed. My favourite scenes in any EQUALIZER film are Denzel Washington watching his timer for the ten seconds countdown, just before showing his skills.....JUST GREAT !!!!!","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","TomTalksFilms","2 October 2023","5 years since the last film in the equaliser franchise and Denzel Washington is back as Robert McCall. For anyone not in the know Robert McCall is a bit like a John Kramer character who deals out justice to those who may have continued to get away with their actions otherwise. Unlike Kramers use of traps though McCall prefers a good old fashioned shotgun, Sniper or pistol, you get the idea. This time around he finds himself in a small town in Southern Italy being attended to by a doctor after taking a bullet to the back in the films prologue. He begins to get used to the fine things Italy is known for such as their food, hospitality and oh yeah drug smuggling gangs.Just as he starts to feel like he's found the perfect place to retire his break is interrupted by a gang called the Camorra who without going into spoiler territory essentially plan to take the town for themselves.It feels somewhat unfair to compare this film to the likes of John Wick Chapter 4 as yes of course they would both fit into the same genre as they're both action films. That being said however it's a bit like comparing CS:GO with Call Of Duty, yes they're in the same genre, they're both online multiplayer first person shooters but at the same time they're very different. This film is very much like the CS:GO to John Wicks Call Of Duty. Robert McCall is much more methodical and spends more time planning than taking action this does mean that there's overall less action in this film compared to say the likes of John Wick. I don't think that's a bad thing though as what action there is in the film is impactful and I have to say a lot bloodier than I had anticipated it being. The trade we get with less action scenes is an all together much more grounded story. We see the damage this gang is causing to the people of this tight nit community and as the audience we are fully onboard and are just waiting for McCall to strike. That being said it does also mean that this isn't an action film for all fans of the genre it's a much more realistic story and sets itself and the franchise away from the likes of the John Wick films.Overall this was an enjoyable way to spend a late Monday afternoon and it's great to see Denzel Washington back where he belongs on the big screen after a short hiatus.Rating: 7/10.","7/10"

I like the location and feel of this one, it's well directed. I do question what it is that he's doing there all day and night though, all we see is him drinking tea in the cafe. This one contains no sappy person for him to save thankfully and has the appropriate violence. The people of this small town help him and welcome him among them and he's happy to return the favour.","8/10"

It's a little slow at times, but it's clear they wanted more story than action. The characters are good.

"The Equalizer 3","lavatch","4 January 2024","There is a special moment in ""The Equalizer 3"" when Robert McCall addresses a thug in a restaurant, emphasizing how ""timing"" was so important in bringing them together. And the point he was stressing was how unfortunate the timing was for the thug!No actor could possibly play McCall with the swagger of Denzel Washington, which makes watching this movie so enjoyable. It is especially his concern for the downtrodden of the world that is both touching and engaging.This episode is set in the idyllic Sicilian town of Altomonte in Sicily. It is there that McCall becomes attached to the locals, such as the kind Dr. Enzo Arisio, who nurses him back to health after being shot in the back. There is even a slight romantic intrigue when a restaurant proprietor takes an interest in McCall when she admires his hat!Another good character development was Collins, the CIA agent who at first is skeptical about McCall who becomes ""a person of interest"" and later ""an interesting person.""Everyone is hoping for a fourth installment of the compulsively watchable Equalizer.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","ShadeKnight","16 November 2023","The plot seems like it was taken from a 4-year-old and expanded upon - poorly.Every action in the film felt unjustified, unbelievable, and underwhelming.Character development was sub-par, taking the reasonable yet haunted character from the first two films and making him an untenable sociopath, at times irreconcilable with himself in the same film. Everyone else in the film was a cardboard cut out, even the love interest that goes nowhere and merely serves as a) eye candy, and b) someone the main character can be ""empathetic"" with to offset his apparent psychosis, thereby giving the audience a slim thread of likability to hang on to.The action was mediocre at best. The ""let's all stick together"", syrupy-sweet relationships that develop are hackneyed and implausible.I don't fault Mr. Washington for this tripe, he's an excellent actor. It genuinely feels as if the writers threw this together in a couple of weeks, high on adrenaline and whatever else, and genuinely thought it was passable. It wasn't.Truthfully, I've never been a fan of Mr. Fuqua, except for a couple of his films. Just about everything he's done has attempted to be grandiose and elevating and merely gets to ""meh"" on the meter.Anyway, watch the film. If you like it because coastal Italy seems exotic to you, great. But don't be afraid to come to terms with disliking it within the first 45 minutes and turning it off.","8/10"

"The Equalizer 3","doyler79","4 September 2023","In the cinematic world of ""The Equalizer 3,"" Denzel Washington reprises his indelible role as Robert McCall, reviving a character that bears the distinct aura of a modern-day Western hero.

"The Equalizer 3","martimusross","8 November 2023","Equaliser 3It got off to a very slow start, however this pace was all part of a very well planned story that required lots of comprehensive characters, and there were a lot of them. Some of them were really violent, threatening small time thugs that enjoyed torturing innocent and defenceless people, this is the setting for our hero to settle some scores. The story only made sense at the end so you have to be patient.A few things irritated, the subtitles it was practically an all Italian movie.Slowly but surely the tension built and hero delivered in spades, the camerawork was inspired as were the medieval settings, apart from the Mafiosa types lol, I want to get on a plane tomorrow and visit this beautiful place.Overall this was a really great movie and Densiel was inspired. I'm giving this a really firm 8, it didn't disappoint, but beware there is one terribly gory scene that you might want to hide behind your blanket.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","sjensenstrad","9 October 2023","The Equalizer movies are just awesome. Denzel has a strong one dimensional character that despite overwhelming coolness and always 1 inch from violence manage to also have empathy and warm heart for the weak. Denzel is genius at this.This third story was a bit confusing at the beginning, in Italy, why?But from there it turns in to a warm and extremely cinematic movie, the violence is absolutely more sparse in this one. But for me it did not matter. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to the end as it was entertaining and thrilling.If you would like more Denzel Washington I can recommend ""Fallen"" it is my all time favorite movie.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","ahmdemir-86645","13 December 2023","First of all hello everyone The movie once again included beautiful scenes. But I think the first two movies were more logical and interesting. When you say justice, the subject and actor of the movie, Denzel Washington, immediately comes to mind. Still, it's okay, it's watchable, it's not a very boring and low-level movie. Maybe logically it could have been a better movie. Only the operation to eliminate the mafia and save the town was good. Still, watch a good movie, don't miss it and write in the comments what kind of movie you watched. Happy movie enjoyment to everyone, have a good dayBye....","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Cinephilos","13 October 2023","All three Equalizer movies make the audience not only hate the villains but also the villains' culture and nation. In Equalizer 1, the Russian mafia and Russians in general are described as evil. It's difficult to distinguish the villains from their cultures. The Russian mafia regional boss who dies on the funky floor disdains the entire American people by saying ""You Americans think you can buy whatever you want."" In Equalizer 2, there is even less sympathy for the Turkish father who abducts his daughter from his ex-wife only to hurt her. The audience gets the feeling that not only this Turkish man but also his entire culture is complicit in this crime because the Turkish culture is mysogynistic and patriarchical. About Denzel's African-American sidekick painter, one can't decide whether to root for him or to give up on the African-American male culture which drives men to crime. As for Equalizer 3, I got the feeling that Italy is so powerless about the organized crime that the innocent peace-loving people and the police must all bow before the omnipotent Camorrah. Although the audience roots for the good Italians, it also learns to fear the loss of government control over crime in Italy. The only good guys are the CIA, which is a strange way of looking at the world.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Horror_Flick_Fanatic","14 September 2023","The Equalizer 3 (2023) is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the popular action trilogy, starring Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, a retired government operative who now uses his skills to help those who cannot help themselves.In this installment, McCall finds himself drawn into a conflict with the Sicilian Mafia, after his best friend is killed in a seemingly random attack. McCall travels to Sicily to investigate, and soon finds himself caught up in a web of deceit and violence.Washington is once again superb as McCall, bringing a quiet intensity and gravitas to the role. He is equally convincing in both the action scenes and the more dramatic moments. The supporting cast is also excellent, with Dakota Fanning, Remo Girone, and Eugenio Mastrandrea all delivering memorable performances.Director Antoine Fuqua crafts a visually stunning film, with sweeping shots of the Sicilian countryside and picturesque villages. The action sequences are brutal and unflinching, but they are also well-choreographed and exciting to watch.The Equalizer 3 is a must-see for fans of the franchise, and it is also a great film for fans of action movies in general. It is a well-made and entertaining film with a strong performance from Denzel Washington.Here are some of the things that I particularly loved about the film:The Sicilian setting is beautiful and atmospheric, and it provides a fresh backdrop for the action.The supporting cast is excellent, and they all have good chemistry with Washington.The action sequences are brutal and intense, but they are also well-choreographed and exciting to watch.Washington gives a masterful performance as McCall, bringing a quiet intensity and gravitas to the role.The film has a satisfying conclusion that wraps up the trilogy nicely.Overall, The Equalizer 3 is a thrilling and satisfying action film that is sure to please fans of the franchise and fans of the genre in general. I highly recommend it. So many films I have seen this year that I felt wasn't worth the cost of a movie ticket, but I didn't have that feeling with this one. I really enjoyed it and in my opinion, its the best of the Denzel trilogy.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","juelzthegreat","11 October 2023","The ending of this trilogy is all about McCall and his desire to find peace and a home. It probably wouldn't even make sense at this (st)age to let him fight every goddamn Mafioso in Sicily.Yes, it's a bit underwhelming in case of fight scenes as e.g. The scenery starts with lots and lots of dead bodies and you don't really know why and wonder how it all started, but Fuqua wants to put Denzel aka McCall in the spot: his heart, his characteristics, his wisdom, but also the heaviness of his heart because of his transgressions.That's it, that's the film you get, a character study in a action trilogy that even though it feels a bit too shiny (for Fuqua typical unfortunately), it definitely has the heart in the right place. And I appreciate that a lot from a flick, where everyone expects only action and violence.","1/10"

For a prequel, Denzel Washington is too old. The formula of a vigilante bringing justice to people is not new, but the shooting in Southern Italy is magnificent. The plot is nice, showing a receptive population that welcome Robert McCall and makes him feel good. The plot of the international drug traffic gives the chance to see Dakota Fanning, now a young woman, in the role of a CIA agent that Robert tips off and uses his advices. The plot with the Mafia (Camorra) is very well resolved by Robert McCall in the end. Great to see Vincent having an OD with his drugs. That should be the fate of drug dealers in every civilized country. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Protetor: Cap√≠tulo Final"" (""The Protector: Final Chapter"")","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","mluinstra","2 November 2023","Greetings from the other side. I enjoyed the first two Equalizer movies, so I was excited to see number 3. Was I ever disappointed! Heck, I didn't even watch the entire movie. I got to around 2/3 and then picked up my phone and whatever. Since the movie no longer interested me, I was half-watching it until the end.This movie was SO BORING. I see other reviews telling us that the scenery was beautiful, and that's because there is no action or anything else to watch. They show us Denzel walking down stairs with a cane, Denzel drinking tea, and Denzel going up the stairs with his cane. Most movies wouldn't show us the entire journey up and down the stairs, but this one does.There was so very little action, that it shouldn't have been called an Equalizer movie, but something else. It was like a bait and switch. I'm not even sure what the heck is was about. The intro was good, and I got excited because it was Denzel killing bad guy butt, but then it was just the camera following him around like he was on vacation, and it was boring as hell.I tried watching this a couple months ago, and I got bored and did something else. I tried again tonight and the same thing happened.Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie. That bogus Equalizer TV series with Queen Latifh is a joke as well. She is a great actress, but she can't pull off that role. So many cuts during her fight scenes that you could fall into an epileptic seizure. Plus that kid of hers is annoying as hell, and having a kid on this type of show is just silly.","6/10"

It was like one of those bad summer movies where the violence is too much. I love a good action flick but I don't need this level of violence to entertain me! Denzel Washington doesn't need to make this garbage for us to watch anything he in. Sort of reminds me of the Expendables...to many exploding heads for my liking. On a side note, the countryside and Italy was so lovely... it reminds me of my time in Tuscany when I was a child.

"The Equalizer 3","JohnDeSando","1 September 2023","""What happens here, happens in many towns. The mafia. They're like cancer. No cure."" Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone)The good doctor of a picturesque Amalfi coastal town is about to discover that his patient, the imposing anonymous Black man, Robert (Denzel Washington), can cure that cancer. It's all a fantasy, of course, but a durable one.Just like our formulaic Westerns, our vigilante motif lives where the stranger comes into town and changes things. Considering the long tradition of spaghetti westerns, Italy is a comfortable place for our good versus evil shootouts.This third and presumably last installment of its franchise, The Equalizer 3 has much less of a body count than, say, in John Wicke, but far more heart and soul as it zeroes in on the masterfully understated expressions of the Oscar-winning star. While the Wicke franchise offers bloody ballet, Equalizer McCall offers terse no nonsense: ""Nine seconds. That's what I'll give you to decide your fate.""Why this retired government assassin lands here is uncertain, but it is certain that while he grows loving toward the town, he is equally appalled by the Camorra mafia's blatant drug smuggling and abuse of the townspeople. He will have none of that.In a series of bloody set pieces, especially the painful ""arm wrestling"" encounter, Robert begins to set things straight. Helped by the luscious cinematography of Tarantino's lenser, Robert Richardson, with the pure white town spotted in red, director Antoine Fuqua and screenwriter Richard Wenk capture the beautiful vulnerability of a former medieval fishing town confronting the messy brutality of modernity.Like most others in the audience, I know what is coming to the bad guys as this improbable savior whitewashes the bloody town to make it pure again. Because this is allegedly Washington's swan song as Robert McCall, we watch more intently the professional assassin of The Equalizer 3 put to order the other not so smart assassins.My delight is the comfort that comes from seeing the bad guys get what they deserve because they are getting away with murder of various kinds in our real world.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","statuskuo","11 September 2023","This is a movie that just feels like they were painting by the numbers. If you enjoy the cookie cutter action flick, it's not bad. The template is a western. A solitary man (with some affliction) shows his ability of force. He come to a town that is suffering under corruption. He is pushed to the limits until he fights back for the townspeople.Yep. It's that basic. Again, if this template plays to your heart, this is worth a watch.I would also say, seeing Dakota Fanning, previous of ""Man On Fire"" with Denzel was a bit jarring. That might've been the selling point, but she is as believable as a operative as Jason Statham would be as a mild mannered reporter in a cape. It just felt awkward. I would almost assume she studied Jodie Foster in ""Silence Of The Lambs"" Her line deliveries are very strange and her gait doesn't have that feel of a person of authority (people in law enforcement know what that walk looks like; Dakota seems to be attempting it, but comes off as a gazelle moseying).The action doesn't swell to where you want it to go. The original Denzel Equalizer felt so satisfying in doing away with the baddies. This one felt so...bland. Some of the violence is cartoonish. Such as shoving a gun through a guy's skull and firing through it (c'mon). While others feel like just run of the mill items of convenience used to make ugly bloody pulpy messes.The baddie in here is a nod to a town's gentrification. I know Denzel loves being the savior of the underdog, but does the script have to have it be so obvious. His tough guy words seem off these days. He was such a presence in ""Man On Fire"" That flame is gone.I get the link between Dakota and Denzel. It's as if you are a fan of ""Man On Fire"" and you want to know what became of Pita afterwards.Well, she's a spec op who walks funny.All in all, not a bad watch. It does what you want it to do. Nothing more, nothing less.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Gringorilla","13 September 2023","The Equalizer has went the opposite direction of John Wick. While John Wick has become more and more action-filled and chaotic, The Equalizer has toned the action down in favor of more meaningful scenes and tone. But there is power in the pause! After learning from the first films what Robert McCall is capable of, every scene where he does not act on his abilities makes more of an impact. Instead of getting bored from tediously long action scenes, you get the suspense of waiting for hell breaking loose. And when it does, it is glorious.This movie is not without faults. It introduces some new characters that frankly doesn't need to be there as they don't affect the plot at all, and the ending is somewhat lackluster.The story itself is a pretty standard affair, but it is excellently excecuted. Throughout it you develop empathy for the right characters, antipathy for the others, and in general get a sense of the stakes at hand.All in all, this is, by a small margin, my favorite outing in the series.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","connecttoaakash","2 September 2023","I approached the theatre with minimal expectations, given that ""Equalizer 2"" had failed to live up to its predecessor's standard. Nonetheless, watching seasoned actors like Denzel Washington and Liam Neeson, both in their 70s, deliver relentless action remains a guilty pleasure of mine. Denzel's films consistently resonate more deeply with me, thanks to the emotional depth he brings, which is sometimes lacking in Liam's recent work.To my surprise, this sequel exceeded my expectations regarding its grounded and gritty nature. Denzel, a once-in-a-lifetime actor, excels at conveying vulnerability and loneliness through his expressive eyes and facial expressions. In this movie, he expertly portrays a character torn between conflicting emotions - doing the right thing or walking away.Director Antoine Fuqua, renowned for his ability to depict violence and its consequences, doesn't disappoint in this regard. The screenplay is tightly woven, with the first half focusing on the protagonist's quest for community and a sense of belonging.The cinematography is exceptional, beautifully capturing the picturesque Italian towns.A special mention goes to Dakota Fanning's inclusion despite her limited screen time. Her chemistry with Denzel shines, evoking nostalgia for their previous collaboration in ""Man on Fire.""Throughout the film, a recurring dialogue emphasizes that ""you are where you were supposed to be,"" while Denzel's character grapples with feelings of being lost. Strangely, after the movie's conclusion, I reflected on the same sentiment.","8/10"

Even though these are McCall's easiest foes, they may be the most satisfying deaths. He's more of Michael Myers slasher killer in this one.

He is the sole savior of this film since it is a total trainwreck. Yes Italy lends itself for beautiful scenic shots and the maffia for a good story. But boy oh boy did they make it a good guys/bad guys script filled with nonsense. To name a few plotholes/nonsense: the internet gang hacks the bank account of a pensionfund so the pensioners loose their money. They transfer the money but then change it into cash. The maffia threathens a policeman and mutilates a head of police while corrupt policemen are usually assets that are bribed and blackmailed. On the plaza Robert is confronted with Vincent after killing his brother. But after the confrontation Vincent leaves without Robert (usually would have been pushed in a van and transported away). Robert knocks Vincent unconscious, but still manages him to let him eat his own drugs. How? Robert gives the bag with cash to a CIA operative with only the name of the man to which it belongs. A) how does this women gets the money into the USA without any problems and b) how does she know where to find him? It is all lazy scriptwriting, hopefully Equalizer4 will have an intelligent script that makes sense.","5/10"

She is very obviously miscast, but that is no excuse for this bad of a performance. Just terrible! Every line is flat and she is completely out of her element. The attempt at being a tough girl is laughable.Then in the last 15 minutes everyone gets slaughtered in the usual Equalizer style, but I wasn't interested in/attached to any of the characters.

"The Equalizer 3","latinfineart","18 November 2023","I would say this was an entertaining film. I thought the Gomorrah guys were a little over the top, especially the big boss and his brother, but the movie was scenic and the local Italian towns were great. As usual with Fuqua, the direction seem to be handled well, and the writing wasn't bad. Denzel was great. Fanning was decent, but I felt she was miscast for the role, or perhaps they should have written her character as someone with more field experience. She felt like she was in over her head and did not feel like a feasible character.The one thing that I did object to was the soundtrack, it was one of the worst soundtracks I've heard in the past 10 or 20 years. It felt like it was done by a kid who was trying to be annoying, and there was absolutely no reason for that. Lots of good artists out there who could have created a soundtrack that helped to absorb one into the fail, instead of the opposite effect. Hopefully Marcelo Zarvos does not get any more films to degrade.","7/10"

Denzel Washington will be 70 next year, but his hero Robert McCall is still ready to kill dozens of armed criminals with his bare hands, timing it with a stopwatch on his watch. Clear, this is a non-serious entertainment show. What's more serious is who the Americans are smearing with mud along the way. The evil Syrians are sending synthetic drugs (to be sure, with the Syrian flag is on the packaging) to the Neapolitan Commore. Using the huge money raised from their sale, evil Italian mafiosi make a bomb and blow up... a train station in Italy. Well, you've heard about unmotivated aggression. And only the CIA, in the person of blonde yesterday's schoolgirl, with the help of a retired volunteer bone crusher, can unravel this sinister scheme.

So much so, that back when it came out I was on ""Team Equalizer"" (against Team John Wick) ... I know, no one asked for that - at least officially.But some people were wondering who is better ... as much as I love Denzel Washington (let's keep it real, he is the better actor of the two), John Wick does not just have a movie more (both having TV shows, though Equalizer is not supposed to be any good, from what I've heard) ... but it is the better franchise! No denying that - and while the inferior second movie is almost forgotten with the final (?) entry in the franchise ... it is not erased. It is there - I quite liked that one too, but it did not hold a candle to the other movies.All that said, there was a lot of ... well people were telling me how brutal this one is. Maybe I have become used to it (movie violence that is), but while this does have a few really hardcore spikes ... when it comes to brutality, I was not ... shook (that's what people say nowadays, right?).

"The Equalizer 3","silicontourist","7 October 2023","Its very hard not to like Denzel (Washington) in any of his films over the years because, he is a superb actor who has great screen presence. Whereas the first 2 films were straight to the point, with a faster pace and some nice extra touches (like the emphasis of looking at his watch to evaluate killing time) this 3rd outing is, very laid back with a slower pace that matches the lifestyle pace of a place like Italy; especially in the islands. Its all done with an abundance of really cool style wrapped around a very good script. His payback to the thugs is done in a thinking, planned perfection (most likely the reason that the films critical dissenters did not like as it wasn't just wham, bang and dead). It was literally a cool, memorable and stylishly clever way to end on a good trilogy final note. Oh yes! He kills a ton of Mafia scumbags as well so, there is still a lot of Denzil's original villain disposing action sequences. And its all done amidst some of the finest scenery you will ever get to see in a film!I will miss this series of McCall Equalizer payback films.","3/10"

"The Equalizer 3","mselby-01342","4 January 2024","""The Equalizer 3"" dives into a fresh and engaging plot that, while somewhat detached from its predecessors, perfectly suits the enigmatic character portrayed by Denzel Washington. The film kicks off with a riveting scene where we're led through a sprawling estate, eerily adorned with casualties of Denzel's character's actions. This installment takes a different pace than your typical action-packed flick; it's slower, but this deliberate pacing is key to its charm. It allows for a thorough exploration of the narrative, and as viewers, we get to deeply appreciate the quaint Italian town setting. The depiction of the town's life is heartwarming, introducing us to affable locals whose lives are soon disrupted by the tyranny of a local mafia boss. This development cues the classic intervention by Denzel's character, resonating with the essence of the Equalizer series.Admittedly, compared to its high-octane predecessors, this film might seem like the series' underdog. However, it stands out with its unique storytelling and setting. If you're a fan of Denzel Washington, enjoy a good action film, and appreciate a story of justice, ""The Equalizer 3"" is definitely worth your time. It may not be the strongest in the series, but it's a commendable addition that offers a different flavor to the Equalizer saga.","4/10"

"The Equalizer 3","rmmil","5 January 2024","I'll start off by saying I loved the first film in this series. I thought the 2nd film was ""okay"". The 3rd film, well...it has a great shooting location, I'll say that much.When crafting any story a basic requirement is some level of tension. An actor can be an absolutely amazing one like Denzel Washington, but if your script gives you nothing there's not much you can do with it.This film lacks ANY tension. The outcome is a foregone conclusion. The protagonist has, slowly, between each film, become more and more a ""John Wick"" level killing machine but his opponents in this film are about as tough as your average street thugs.There is never any moment when you think Denzel's character could lose. The final shoot out is a non event.The film pads its length considerably by adding in a pointless subplot to reunite Denzel Washington with Dakota Fanning. Fanning, playing the least believable CIA / NSA (?) operative in cinema history, exists in this film to be this weird nepotism favor Denzel gets involved with part way into the film, but her true purpose is to make a short-ish plot light film somewhat higher stakes.This was a big disappointment from previous Equalizer films. Go watch it for the scenery and nothing else.","2/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Scar38","20 December 2023","I really enjoyed this film, it kept me entertained and on the edge of my seat for the entire running time.Denzel Washington is such a good actor, he excels in everything he does, every time I watch him I know I'm going to enjoy it, and he is still so fast, his fight scenes are brilliant and so well done, despite him being nearly 70.I was a bit apprehensive about Dakota Fanning being a lead in this, but I was pleasantly surprised, she is beautiful and a very good actress, if there is a sequel I hope she will be in it.I'd like to say how good the bad guys were aswell, the way they treated people made me hate them, but their comeuppance was fitting and very violent.Brilliant film.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","ajkeller1122","3 January 2024","Is this Equalizer 3? It sure doesn't feel like it.First 2 movies were great! Loved them! Saw the rating on this one (Higher than the 2nd one!) so I went into it, thinking I was in for a treat. I'll say this for sure... 10 minutes in, I fell asleep...Oh man, oh man, oh man....... What the hell went wrong with this one? I love Denzel Washington. Great actor. And he's good in this. But this didn't feel like an Equalizer movie.First off, it's VERY slow. You get a decent opening sequence with some blood splatter & what not. But after that it's just a dull, plain, bland movie. Also the score/ost/music was VERY weird & annoying. It really bothered me that they didn't even bring back the original Equalizer theme.Seriously, the music is VERY bad.The ending is... Well... it's an ending I guess? If you're expecting McCall to kill the final bad guy in brutal fashion like the last 2 movies... Don't get too excited. It's actually a VERY boring death. I was counting on the watch with McCall and wondering ""bro, when's this dude gonna be dead?"" We literally follow this guy to his death for like 2 mins....So what was the point of this movie? Other than give Robert McCall his happy ending, I don't really know? Again, I love the first 2 movies. Was VERY excited for this one. But unfortunately, it didn't deliver at all. I will say it delivers utter disappointment.It took a couple years for the same writers of the first 2 movies to write this script to the final chapter... Seeing as how the 2nd film ended, that could've been the finale & to me, it will be.VERY disappointed. If you're expecting this to be on par with the first 2 movies, I promise you... You'll be disappointed. I'll only give it a 4/10 since some of the kills were good & denzels acting but that's really it. I'll never watch it again though.","1/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Lythas_85","2 September 2023","The begining was kind of slow.. but since it is a Denzel movie it is always enjoyable.. how does he do that? Most movies when there is no action going on, we just sleep or fast forward through the boredom..anyway, the dakota fanning scene with mccall was funny.. every time they have a female character, they always need to assert dominance and say dumb things.. her taking in mccall or trying to intimidate him or whatever she tried to do lol.Im sorry but she is what? She is 29 but looks 20.. nah, she aint got the looks to try to be some CIA badass case agent.. for that, you should have brought Gadot, De Armas or maybe Johansson.. or Scarlett would have been awesome at this..ok, the last paragraph I was writing while watching the movie so at the end we understand why he was doing this.. she is a rookie and he pretty much feeds her all the info he himself finds because she had no actual intel nor the experience to come up with all those leads and deductions.. but you see.. that is the thing, without McCall to guide her, she would be easily become a one hit wonder..right? She breaks some crazy drug smuggling thing thanks 100% due to Roberto and then she wouldnt be able to do anything close to it later on.. but ok, details, right?And like another reviewer said.. the villains were ridiculous.. ""Teddy"" from movie 1 was much more menacing and presented a better challenge.. here, you have some punks terrorizing the city for half of the movie and when robert gets better, the dudes are gone next scene LOL..even the super bad guy.. he goes to the city, makes a scene.. next sequence, every one of his guys are gone and then he receives some nice OD to see how it is like to die by one..so, I would say the point of the movie was to make him find a place where he belonged and wanted to be there.. let us ignore the fact he aint probably got a visa.. and better yet, no job.. but infinite money for tea every day in the morning at the local caff√©it doesnt matter.. it was just a fitting end starting with him helping someone he barely knew, helping the people he began to care about and also helping someone related to someone he really liked in the past.Well done.","1/10"

"The Equalizer 3","mmjnr10","14 September 2023","Im one of those many who can't seem to find a decent action thriller nowadays and I was so skeptic going into this one especially after the total let down of Equaliser 2.. First part was excellent for me and will remain this way but part 3 doesn't fall too short behind infact some people could find it the best of all 3 subject to taste and different opinions but for whatever it is it got me writing a review on imdb which I very rarely do but I feel obliged doing so after really enjoying it in cinema and as I said the rarity of quality movies in this genre over probably the part 3 years as if Hollywood has gotten of all sudden brain dead with so many so called ""blockbusters"" flopping one after another in such a despicable way that has put off me off going to the theatre all togather.. This is one without giving anything away is a very well done well thought after movie that I believe could go in the classic books with the excellent choice of story, locations and overall directing which will make it standout to any serious viewer with proper taste... If anything you should take from brief comment it's to go and watch it without much expectation for too much expectation will always let you down!I gave this movie 9 yet its more of an 8 especially in comparison to movies coming out in its genre nowadays... it surley is not a 6-7 I tell you that much.. Reason I rate it so highly is to improve it's overall rating and hope others understand this point and be more generous with the rating towards decent films for as I said there is hardly anything decent in this extremely important genre nowdays.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","jenncollins311-172-719781","11 September 2023","Surprised at how much more violent and entirely more bloody than the first two Equalizer movies in this trilogy. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not. The plot leaves alot to be desired. And it didn't seem like there was much dialogue. And it moves pretty slowly. Lots of ""thinking"" scenes which was sort-of misplaced. But they are heavy on the blood and gore and shoot-em-ups. Definitely a slow-burn type of build-up to get the audience worked up and swayed to Denzel's savior side. Whatever. Yes, scenic views of the quaint little Italian village and cute villagers. But just entirely too much gore and blood for my taste. Disappointed they would put this out as a ""blockbuster"" or whatever. Save your money. Stream it in a few months when it is available.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","graves-scott","3 January 2024","The entire action genre now figures they have to copy John Wick. Kill people with everything at hand instead of bringing weapons with you. Every movie tries to one up the last movie with more of that improvised weapons crap.Also, Denzel is almost 70. He requires more cuts in a single fight than Liam Neeson. That has to be a new record.Also why can't thy turn lights on? Everything is so dark and hard to tell what is happening. I am sick of that laziness.Lastly, subtitles. I guess the movie is in Italy so they speak Italian, that's fine. But I can't see the subtitles from my chair, so I don't want to bother with subtitle heavy movies.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","mrdanielkanewilliams","30 January 2024","The film starts off with a good action scene where Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) dispatches some dangerous drug dealers. This ends in a bit where Robert is held at gunpoint which is intense but unfortunately leads to Robert getting injured. Then this results in the next hour being slow whilst Robert's wounds heal.But this slow hour did keep me entertained by introducing the next group of bad guys in a brutal way. From watching the first two movies I also knew there was a big fight coming, but if I hadn't seen the first two movies I might have been tempted to turn the film off during this hour.When this fight starts I was kept very entertained especially when Robert fights off one of the main bad guys in a bar. The last fight scene involves some good stealth action because Robert has to sneak into a bad guy's mansion and kill some henchmen, but during this scene I would have liked to have seen some more hand to hand combat.The end of this scene also drags on for a bit as well, but overall I had fun with this film and I might watch it again... If I can't find anything else on TV/Netflix.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","will003","8 October 2023","What a great entrance! I think is a movie that deserves a 9 out of 10 because I expected a little more action than the movie had. But at the same time, different than in the second movie, Robert is fighting again remembering all the killing he did with an inside conflict without knowing if he is a good or a bad person -in the exact words of the movie. So he ended up in the small village in Italy and the rest is the story of the equalizer! This time, Robert is really trying to settle down in a special place and enjoy the rest of his days, but again is forced to act and serve justice.Considering this, the lack of action in this one in comparison to the other two movies is kinda explained considering that Mr Mccall really wants peace. At the same time, on the first two movies we see a Mr Mccall that is a good person but a sad and lost man that still feels the lost of his late wife. On Equalizer 1 and 2 he is helping people and it's notable that this helps him to carry on, but now, in his on words, Altamonte is giving back what he doesn't feel in a very long time: peace. Considering this, for the first time you see real RAGE when he kills each mafia individual, that's why he is ice cold on his kills! Absolutely amazing!The plot in the end caught me off guard. I don't know about other people, but I really did not expect the girl was who she was. Considering that I don't recall anyone bring her up in any conversation in the previous movies.Anyways, great plot, great scenes, Denzel is the goat in my humble opinion and you can see in his eyes he really hated the mafia that was tormented the people he learned to respect and that gave back the peace he had been looking for some years now.Justice was served again.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","fraser-simons","27 January 2024","Way better than the second one, which was just bad. And it returns to the weirdly American fetish of having spies and killers go to Italy and become enamoured with the people and culture, only to feel like they should intervene and save them from whatever - typically the mafia, of course. We had a brief respite from it with the return of Cartel bad guys and what not. You'd actually think villainizing Russia would be in vogue right now but I guess, who wants to go there and have a good time. It's cold and crappy, right?Anyway. This is very tropey but fun in its prograndist kind of way. There's always someone worse out there than the local drug lord, and it's always our main character. If you're in to this particular power fantasy the action is here for you and everything else is pretty passable. It's no John Wick, but it's better than the average action type movie these days, probably.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","imizrahi2002","16 September 2023","It's enjoyable...
the art and therapy of violence.It's a well put together story that offers the viewer an outlet for all of their existential angst...seems to be a lot of that going around today and movies like this help the viewer feel like they don't have to give vent to all that pent up feeling that life, as we've known it, is coming to an end. Hence, the therapy part of the second line...
i liked the setup. The editing was clever. I can't say how or it would be a spoiler. But you'll understand if you see it.The low ratings are a joke. Probably by guys who went to see it with their girlfriends. And when their girlfriends got either angry that they had been taken to such a violent movie...or did nothing but talk about how attractive Denzel is, all the way home, well...you can see why they rated it so low.And, of course, denzel's got this character DOWN! Just like most other characters he's inhabited...
so sit yourself down in the bloodbath and exit cleansed of your feelings that the bad guys never get their's...edit: and KUDOS to the composer of the OST...there's this part of when some of the violence happens...it's like the instruments are SCREEching! It got into my cells...i'm a musician that can play a number of instruments...have done recording and listened to more music than most 20 people would in a lifetime... and i can't quite figure out which instruments were used to attain that sound...it MIGHT just be some synth patch, but...in any case, it's VERY effective.","8/10"

this one not so much. Works as an ad for the Italian tourist board as scenery is lovely but baddies are from central casting and totally unbelievable. On the other hand the towns people are from straight out of Disney, friendly old ladies, shop keepers giving away fish, helpful retired doctor and angelic children - barf. The overall pace is slow and storyline predictable, Denzel is a one man Magnificent Seven saving the hapless residents.

"The Equalizer 3","Wordwhisperer","9 February 2024","This is the worst Equalizer of all 3. The characters are really really weak. Dakota Fanning's character comes out of the blue, no history behind, gets a big case and all of the sudden the entire CIA is behind her and they win against the Mafia. The mafiosso characters are nothing but dumb dumb people, just like any movie where the main character has to win. The script is awful, huge gaps in it, dumb dialogues which, sometimes, make no sense. There is no link between some of the scenes. It seems like there were short movies that have been added one after another. I wish this series had a better ending.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","petemcphee2","17 October 2023","It is like they made a movie whilst on holiday in Italy. It feels so far removed from the previous two movies I had to check who directed, Antoine Fuqua must have been on Syrian synthetic meth to deliver this. It felt so low budget, like a spaghetti western about gangsters. I'm assuming the wriyers strike caused problems as that would explain why we had 2 action scenes where Robert McCall takes out the baddie villa twice in a movie. The first time its shot without action, just a long tracking shot of carnage through the villa where McCall is revealed to have killed almost everyone but then surrenders so the big boss comes into the room..... so he can then kill him.... cos timing it so the big boss is there was too difficult presumably?Im really dissapointed. The worst part was that the supporting cast were so dreadful. It was nice to see Creasey and Pita back together even if they did shoehorn the big reveal of who her parents were, da da daaaaaa!It's a shame the Equalizer trilogy ends on such a weakened movie.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","alwinsup","31 August 2023","Just came back from the movie theaters; i loved it. The equalizer 3 has a subtle approach. The pace is not very fast but it never gets doll. Instead, you will floath allong with the main character Robert McCall (Played by Denzel Washington) in a lovely italian small city. The setting of this Italian small city is fantastic. You can feel the Italian vibe, the cozyness, the warmth and the simpleness of life where the whole village is one family.Maybe because i also have watched the other two parts and Robert McCall is for me a knowable character; i didnt mind the slow build-up before some action arrived. Instead you get to see more of the other side of his character which is great otherwise it would have been more a repeat of the first two parts. In this way you are more ''grabbed'' by the filmmakers and feel more connected with the ending of this trilogy. Because i dont know about you guys, but i left the movie theater with a smile after the last scene. I cant remember much movie trilogies with a ending thats feels so satisfying like the Equalizer 3 gave me.The action (there is still plenty of it) is good. It felt a little bit like John Wick but somehow also not. I love action shooters movie but believe the film makers did the right thing by not implenting to much over the top violence and shootings. In my eyes it would have disrubted the balance of the movie. Now.. the balance is just perfect and the main focus stays on the story line.Last but not least; i even laughed sometimes during the movie. But maybe not everyone will catch the same vibe as i did. In the end a solid 8 out of 10.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","jessejedi","4 September 2023","I didn't watch the first 2 movies in full. Similar to some of the other reviews, I felt the third one lacked some action. We knew very well the final boss, Vincent, stood no chance against Robert, not to mention they know nothing about Robert. But then as the final scene rolls out, I realized this is the ending of Robert's story. He was always avenging for others, but this time he can protect them. He also found a place he calls home. The purpose and meaning of the music and cinematics throughout the movie now make sense to me, and I finally can properly appreciate the movie for what it is: a retirement tribute to Robert McCall.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Ezpl8yer","13 September 2023","Which isn't a bad thing from the studio's perspective: it means that they have little to no excuses to make many more Equalizer movies. However, unlike Fast and Furious, where one cannot even count the movies anymore, The Equalizer 3 actually is marketed as the 'final chapter'. I say actually because the audiences probably won't notice that this is the final instalment in Robert McCall's story or at least what resembles a story of some sort. This lack of grand-scale storytelling over multiple films is partly due to the first two films on which this film is based on, but that doesn't excuse the film's own narrative problems and its inability to develop our main protagonist and his history from the first two films.Don't get me wrong: The Equalizer 3 is not a terrible film. It certainly improves on certain aspects of The Equalizer 2 and has qualities of its own. Unlike the second Equalizer film, Robert McCall, played by the always reliable and charismatic Denzel Washington, isn't going around the world saving and helping random people. In Contrast, he is much more grounded in a local community, very much like the first film but now in Italy. This gives the story more depth and focuses the plot, even though this advantage over the second film is not fully utilized which I'll explain later. Furthermore, the accompanying cinematography of the locations in Italy is what you expect from a movie of this calibre. The action scenes are also well shot, and mixed with some creativity and symbolism make them well worth the wait in this otherwise slow-paced action film. The accompanying actors all do what they have to do, with a standout turn from Dakote Fanning. On a sidenote, it is nice that actual Italian actors are cast and also speak Italian, in comparison to many Hollywood blockbusters where we have to endure over the top accents in the English language.However, even when these good components are brought together, the story somehow falls flat. In general, the movie is basically about our one-man army Denzel Washington fighting the Italian mafia due to their aggression towards the local people who saved him and gave him peace. Along the way, a bigger connection is formed with international drug trafficking which is where the CIA gets involved and discovers secrets of the Italian mafia Denzel is fighting against as well as secrets of Denzel himself. However, how exactly this connection with drug trafficking was established in the movie is still vague to me after having seen it.Unfortunately, the film has many of these plot points that are shoehorned into the story without much explanation nor elaboration. Although no plot holes are present in this movie, these type of plot points that try to expand the scope of the story fall flat. Not because they do not make sense, but because they do not move forward themes and ideas that are interesting, especially in relation to our main characters. That a mafia clan is bigger than we thought does not really surprise an audience in an action film. I won't reveal spoilers here, but the surprising reveal in the end on the character played by Dakote Fanning that somehow connects this film to the previous two is also disappointing because it is not developed nor played on much in the film, just like the mafia reveal. This is disappointing considering the on-screen chemistry between Denzel and Dakote Fanning.Overall, the story suffers from superficiality. The film is supposed to be about Denzel's character homecoming, him finally 'finding peace'. However, that is difficult to believe. Although much time is dedicated to building a sense of relation for Denzel's character to the local people, it still feels rather superficial in the end because there are no stand-out, well-developed side-characters who reveal something interesting about Denzel's character, let alone his history. He may well be integrated into the daily life of the small Italian town in which almost the entire film takes place, but it doesn't feel like there is a strong bond between the various inhabitants of the town and Denzel's character. Sure, the previous movies didn't flesh out the man's motivations and past, but if there was anytime to do it, it would be now in this third and supposedly last film. At least that is what viewers of the previous two films like me hoped for.This slow build-up that is present in the first half of the film is also undone by the action that follows it. When Denzel and the movie do finally get to business with the Italian mafia, Robert McCall's motivations are even more questioned since he pro-actively goes out to hunt down the members instead of more justifiably attacking them at home when he or his loved ones are threatened. Another home-alone like stand-off sequence as in the first two films would have maybe felt repetitive, but it feels weird to crack down on the mafia this hard with all the violence (this movie is not for the faint-hearted) included when little to no inhabitants of the town have actually been seriously threatened, let alone killed.Even more so, Denzel's character is not even attacked in a way that makes the audience scared of what's to come for him, unlike the first two films where friends were kidnapped, tortured, or even murdered. I guess the equalizer's job is to equalize natural enemies of the people as quickly and efficiently as possible, but it doesn't make for compelling storytelling when our main character does not go through much personal struggle nor physical pain to achieve it. In other words, Robert McCall is kind of too perfect an assassin to be actually believable. The same mistake was made in the second film, and although it looked like this film was steering off of it by injuring Denzel badly in the beginning, his recovery in the end reveals that the filmmakers haven't learned their lesson. It would have been a great opportunity to see him struggle after having to recover and being injured for so long, but his terminator-like skills just reappear without a problem.This makes the killing, although creative and gruesome in a stylistic way, muted since there is little to no danger or actual surprise. As a result, when Robert McCall's duty is over at the end of the film, it comes as a surprise because it feels like the typical processes that a protagonist should normally go through in a film in order for the audience to believe him or her are missing. In a time where films are becoming longer and longer, The Equalizer 3 could have used a longer runtime to implement the necessary scenes for both the story and our main character to be more compelling. Instead, clocking in at 1h49, the film is more style than substance. In this case, the style is greatly executed but given the fact that the action is more sporadic in this film than you would expect, the shallow story is hard to ignore. Both Denzel and the audience deserved better, especially since there was so much potential here.In the end, I would rate this film a 5.5: better than the second film thanks to the recycling of plot strategies of the first film but falling short due to similar mistakes of the second film. Thus, I would recommend to watch this film when it is on sale or released on your preferred home-entertainment platform instead of going to the cinemas for it. Not a bad watch, but certainly not as good as some say.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","jtindahouse","9 October 2023","My ratings for the first two 'Equalizer' films were 9/10 and then a drastic fall down to 6/10. I really enjoyed the first, but the second one I did not find the same connection with. This third entry in the series falls somewhere in-between those two. It was far from perfect, but it did enough to scrape its way to the finish line in one piece.The film has a pretty good opening scene. It was unexpected and unique, and set things up nicely. Then the film falls into a bit of a rut for the next hour or so. There are surprisingly few action sequences in this film. The ones that there are are great, but I certainly could've used more of them.The film has a good menacing villain, but much like the action sequences, it feels like we don't get enough time with him. The film unfortunately spends a lot of the runtime on the least interesting elements.What carries the film though is this character of 'The Equalizer'. He is undoubtedly very cool and lot of fun to watch when he is operating on screen. Sometimes things do all feel about too easy for him, but hey, we aren't coming to these movies for shocks and surprises in the script are we? We know what we are sitting down for and that's what we get. 7/10.","3/10"

"The Equalizer 3","marcussmith-79590","26 September 2023","Equalizer 3 (E3) delivers in a big way. The third installment of this film was more realistic and had a better ending than the second film and slightly less impressive than the first Equalizer. E3 differs from the first two films with it's European setting, possesses a strong storyline with a good amount of bloody action. Dakota Fanning plays a moderate role that made me reflect back to the film ""Man on Fire"" when her and Denzel paired together in another action packed film. I thought E3 was a solid film that delivered. The film's action sequences were gruesome and gory, but not too unrealistic. The plot was simple, but appropriate and Denzel's portrayal of Robert McCall was charming, fierce, and moral. The film hits the mark, especially since it's difficult to make a third film that isn't substantially worse than the first two.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","ginocox-206-336968","7 October 2023","The Equalizer 3 (2013), directed by Antoine Fuqua, starring Denzel Washington reprising his unstoppable vigilante role in the two earlier Equalizer films, offers excellent production values, credible performances, and an enjoyable viewing experience.The tone is a bit uneven. It begins with a sort of mysterious, suspenseful sequence, then grinds to a tedious pace somewhat reminiscent of scenes from Denzel's Man on Fire, then picks up the pace, although in a largely predictable formulaic manner.At 68, Denzel is a little slow and a bit heavy for the role, but is benefited from a quick-cut editing style. At 29, Dakota Fanning seems to have passed her window of opportunity for her role by several years and a few kilos. The other performances, largely by unfamiliar actors, are spot-on and credible, although a bit two-dimensional.The tepid B-story romance falls flat. The film is rated R for violence, but the love story seems better suited to a high-school stage play. Two loose ends seem distracting: the MacGuffin from the opening scene, and a potentially intriguing revenge angle involving a character who fired a .22 bullet. Overall, it could have benefitted from less attention devoted to the picturesque scenery and more effort at character development. Other than miscasting Fanning and the obligatory interracial love interest, the film thankfully avoids woke themes.","7/10"

End of the trilogy, film that the Mafiaso/Cammora characters here are really repugnant, nasty ,vicious individuals -sucking off the blood and sweat of the ordinary working person for 'protection ' money which never really has been addressed in either The Godfather films or Goodfellas.And yet this is how all the 'Corleones' made their fortunes.It was, to a certain degree ,in The Sopranos...
This adds a certain depth to the villians in The Equalizer 3, that one feels a certain elation during the fight scenes. Something that Indy Jones and M. I never had.....even the head Cammora villian looks like the smug,arrogant hospital male Matron Matthew Loga....surely a ripe villian for the taking!Denzil Washington is his usual charming, decent self and his neat,orderly fastidiousness (certainly with dunking his tea bags) reminds me of my friend Chris!It looks good- showing Sicilly with all its "" ciao Mama Mia"" stereotypes-,with well directed action scenes and whilst the romantic sub plot with a cafe owner is poorly written, it has heart,soul and pace.A worthy finale to an enjoyable trilogy.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Arek-kerA","1 October 2023","This is a very forced sequel made just to grab some more cash from the audience. The actions scenes are on a tv show level and the plot is predictable. It looks cheap and undeveloped. The overall quality is belowe ""streaming service premiere"" quality. Even regarding cinematography - it's grainy, it's shaky, it's random. The cast sleepwalks through the whole movie. It's a pity that such a talented actor like Denzel Washington is in this movie. His career went south, I rewatched the original Equalizer and it was so much better. Big dissapointment and waste of cinema screen. Should go staright to tv.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","sswren1","5 September 2023","Saw it today. Frankly I must be old school. Not old hat; old school. Because I enjoy good scripts and characters I can either identify with or feel empathy for.I'm not part of the short attention span generation who requires explosions and mindless violence that doesn't give you time to take a breath (John Wick) or where the screen is loaded with so much tech and gimmickry (Transformers) or the foul language masquerades anger for toughness (nearly everything) so I can feel totally entertained with this one. A good script, sensational photography which is incidentally why the pacing of the film works. The town is amazing. The people are delightful. The bad guys are horrific and doctor Enzo steals our heart.There's enough of McCall's trademark to satisfy. Wow.An awesome piece. A great way to wrap the series.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","bostonct","2 September 2023","Denzel does this like only Denzel can. He's getting a bit long in the tooth but it was a pretty solid entertaining movie. I wish this series started earlier so there would be more sequels as I do still like watching Denzel do his thing. Personally, I thought things tied together reasonably well (need to stay to the end to see it). The Italian locale offered some pre-conceived notions that may cloud our views and/or opinions but I don't think it got into the way at all. Everyone else has offered up their views on the action so I won't duplicate. Just know that if you're a Denzel fan and/or a fan of the Equalizer series, you will enjoy this one, and maybe you'll hope there's one more, like I hope.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","levybob","1 September 2023","Seriously, if you decide to see 'Equalizer 3' you already know the sort of film, the sort of story, the sort of action you're in for. Hamlet, it isn't. Oscars it ain't gonna win. Subtlety is nowhere to be found. So, the question is,Given all that, will you be disappointed?I was, sort of.This McCall (Denzel Washington) seems somehow unrelated to the McCall of the earlier two films. He's no longer 'the regular guy' with a secret who just happens to work at Home Depot. No. It's as though he's been looking for trouble, and as the film opens he's found it. Or it found him. But here's the problem. He is so good at what he does (killing), and what he says (telling his victims what's going to happen to them and when) that when the fighting starts we know that nothing can happen to him. And so whatever suspense there might once have been, it's no longer there.But there's good to be had.(1) This Equalizer is shot in Italy (likely The Amalfi Coast) and it's great to look at. Its beauty makes for an ironic counterbalance to the violence that takes place.(2) Like in 'The Magnificent Seven' what we have here is a village being controlled by a band of hoodlums. Did I hear 'Mafia'? Could be. And so the stranger in town is faced with either walking away or helping the helpless in their battle against crime.(3) The bad guys are really bad. Unfortunately the worst of the bad guys gets off'd too early (for my taste).(4) There's a question raised early in the film. Is McCall a good man or a bad man. And when he's asked, McCall answers, I don't know. And after viewing the film in its entirety, I'm not altogether sure.Anyway, You know what you're in for. So, go and enjoy.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","lizma-02967","7 September 2023","I just watched the 3rd one instalment of the Equalizer series and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pacing was excellent and the characters were all well introduced. The bad guys weren't likeable at all and perhaps that's what prevented me from giving it a full 10 out of 10 score. I thought the story should have spent an extra 10 minutes or so to flesh out the bad guys, maybe something like their upbringing or background of their family. Make them just a little bit more 3d and not so 2d in the story.Denzel's character McCall is a superhero, simple as that, though one without any bullet proof skin or ability to fly. I suspended any disbelief to thoroughly enjoy myself since he's the most believable superhero possible. Robert (or his Italian name Roberto) McCall is a great superhero hero we really want to see in real life, calm, cool and knows everything there is to know about swiftly dispatching the bad guys using just his Flash-like speed and medical doctor knowledge of every square inch of the human body.It does seem like it's the final outing of Denzel or McCall as the protagonist but? I suspect the story seems to suggest the next episode is one where he returns as a guru to a protege. The setting could well be the same location in charming southern Italy where McCall seems very much at home.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","shelbythuylinh","23 September 2023","They should call this Robert McCall One Man Army LOL. Nothing ever fazes him and he is cool, calm, and collected but deep down at least he has a soul. Not all mercenaries or PI's would having such a soul.But in all seriousness, he finds a place in Italy and finds his place. It seems the violent past comes back to haunt him though he wants to so desperately leave that behind. Still he can't help but be involved.Italian mafia bullies people who are poor and less fortunate and even the police can do nothing about it. Going so far as nearly having a police friend of McCall's getting badly beaten up and nearly killed.So McCall uses his brand of justice to finally end the mafia and find peace once and for all.Nice to see a Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington reunion. She was just a kid when they first teamed up. Still the ending will surprise you about her character!","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","dasa108","17 October 2023","Very good movie. The construction of the plot and the feeling of tension grows until an ending that has it all. It must be recognized that one of the keys to the film is to take us to a different place (the first two were in the US) and that place was magnificently filmed, generating visual delight. The casting, cinematography, cinematography and direction were top notch. A couple of details should be noted: the first is the loose end of the first sequence that one hoped would be resolved; The second is the lack of realism in the representation of crime (exaggerated) and the police (ineffective, corrupt) that does not go hand in hand with the reality of present-day Italy. Despite this, it is an enjoyable experience and represents his ideal role for the main actor. It is a film that has rhythm but honors great masters like Peckimpah where the violence can be fierce but does not necessarily take up all the footage. Recommended.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","cruise01","2 September 2023","3 out of 5 stars.The Equalizer 3 is a fair vigilante action thriller which Denzel Washington delivers his action role and a direction by Antoine Fuqua which feels like a formula sequel.The plot is good. Taking its setting in Italy this time with Robert (Denzel Washington) laying low and living with the people in a small town. Until they are being harrassed by italian mobster. Which he starts taking matters into his own hands. While the US government lead by Dakota Fanning is on Roberts trail.Plot is decent. Feels like an episodic thin story for the franchise. An italian mobster harrassing people for money and they are menacing the town by taking it over.Denzel Washington delivers the role and is always worth the watch with these films. Dakota Fanning is also a new addition which has some connections to Roberts past. While the rest of the cast ensemble is okay and the bad guys are forgettable.The action sequences is okay and gritty with its opening sequence. The action does fall thin in the climax.Overall, it is an okay film with a great lead and decent direction but falls short with its action and decent plot.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","jkb2012","8 January 2024","As a fan of both the franchise and Denzel Washington I can definitely say that this is a very good film and I personally thought that out of all The films in the trilogy this one was particularly better than the last two even though I know normally sequels by the 3rd one get bad however this one is not that just the fact that that takes place in Italy is interesting and not the US if you are a fan of the franchise you will definitely like this installment also I thought it was awesome that they didn't kill off Denzel's Washington's character normally that happens in a film like this but it never did and I I'm so glad I definitely hope they make a 4th one with Dakota Fanning.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","imseeg","2 September 2023","Denzel Washington (rogue agent) goes to Sicily (Italy) to combat the Italian mob. And he wacks them all. The end.The bad: too little action, too much Sicilian scenery. Only about 5 figthing scenes, that's a bit meager. Sicily does look beautiful, but isnt this suppose to be another Equalizer edition (the final one) and doesnt every Equalizer movie has to have A LOT of thrilling fighting scenes? Bit disappointing to be honest.More bad: the (supposedly vicious) mob boss isnt impressive at all. So arent the other mobster guys. They look kinda silly and are way too easily killed by Denzel. No real thrill in that.Even more bad: Dakota Fanning is miscast as a (supposedly) tough cia agent. She looks too cute for that.Conclusion: Lacking in thrill, lacking in action, lacking in mean bad guys.Not any good?It's not all bad though. Denzel Washington is still COOL, CALM and COLLECTED, the way I like to see him, but it's too much looking like Denzel was on holiday on Sicily, instead of being a thrilling gangster movie.Ah well, despite the slowburning ""holiday"" look and feel of this last edition, it is still an enjoyable watch...but the first edition is definitely better, although the second edition is definitely worse, way worse than this one....","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","travisvincent","5 December 2023","The third entry into the Equalizer series left me wanting no more. Part of the problem is it feels like Denzel Washington's heart wasn't in it like the first two. Also, the plot is thin and within the first 15 minutes I realized this was going to be paint by numbers, not breaking any new ground. The action is decent but the gore is over the top, reminded me of a horror movie and not an action movie. The cinematography however is fantastic. There are plot inconsistencies that could've and would've ended the movie sooner so of course the movie drags on. Add to that that half the movie or more is subtitled...and here's the kicker, I forgot to enable subtitles and when I realized I didn't, I didn't care and could still follow the plot. Dakota Fanning however, was a pleasant surprise and did a good job in her small role.To summarize: it's not a horrible movie but I expected more considering the star and series.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","smirn_dogg","9 October 2023","Simply another movie about the Americans ""freeing"" another country. The film advanced the common narrative of ""Oh poor (insert country name) is so oppressed, please, almighty Americans, come and save it!"" It also exploits the scenic Italian countryside and urban centres to make up for its lack of storyline, meaningful dialogue, and a failed attempt at romance between Denzel and the Italian waitress. It's really not worth watching unless you want to watch the pitiful remnants of Denzel's once great acting career fizzle out on the screen before you. I really expected more from Fuqaua, this was a garbage-quality film.","5/10"

"The Equalizer 3","MovieIQTest","28 October 2023","It's such a pain to watch this great actor to play a role that would be ideal for him 20 or 25 years ago; even 10 years earlier would be still okay for him, and of course, such flashback time zones would also be very comfortable for us to watch him playing that action hero. But this third movie about this character played by Danzel is just painful and tasteless to watch.He walked like an old man, even he tried to pretend he was still young enough to do the labor. His face was puffy, his limbs were loose without muscles, his lips even slanted to one side and dropped lopsided. When he played the regular patron in the diner, he looked exactly a regular black American retiree, old and spiritless. The characterization made him to constantly arrange and rearrange the napkins on the small table, by doing so, it also prolong the movie length. He climbed the endless steep steps with difficult energy, even it was his bullet wounds caused him so, but in the real world, he's indeed too old to climb so many steep staircases.Regarding the movie itself, it also turned out to be not so great to watch. I just could give it 2/10 Stars.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","bheadher","5 January 2024","Now why would I say that...perhaps because each of the Equalizer movies has a unique 'mood' to the story. Certainly 1 and 2 had plenty of villains, but 3 stands alone, allowing us all to see pure evil and how Robert McCall responds to that evil.Yes, Danzel pulls out all the stops this time, vanquishing evil the best way he can...from nowhere. Just like a ghost haunting the streets of a Sicilian town, he is not there and suddenly he is everywhere. At no time can you predict from where he will strike; yet you know he will. I'm sure you've noticed I am avoiding spoilers at all cost this time. For you to fully appreciate this episode in the Equalizer trilogy you must not have any preconceived notions on what happens next.Just enjoy this one, for it truly is SUPERB!!!","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","dtswpod","15 September 2023","Favorite episode from the old TV show was when the this guy beats his wife and kid and to teach him the error of beating up people the Equalizer rips the guy to a bloody pulp. Lesson learned, it's bad to use your fists, except, you know, when it's okay.Credit to this film, it doesn't even pretend to be as high minded. Violence is pretty much the only solution in this picture and the movie shows plenty of it. And like the old Edward Woodward show, you won't mind much because the bad guys are 100%, grade A cartoons. Plus, it's Denzel doing the ass kicking and he's always a joy to watch, even when he displays what can only be described as the ability to become invisible.No, its not a super hero movie but the ability to become invisible must be one of the Equalizer's talents because the guy sure gets in and out of places without anyone seeing him. Or seeing him too late.Look, it's a stupid movie. You want the better angels of our nature go find Denzel's performance in The Tragedy of Macbeth. That's art. This is fun, garbage for the teenagers and those adults who know better but don't care.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","MiloSuperSpesh","8 October 2023","This is a glorious feast for the eyes, amazing cinematography, set pieces that hit hard and fast out of nowhere, minimal filler, straight to the point.Denzel / robyn mcall slips back in to his black clothes with ease, but it seems like his age is catching up with him, as he moves slower in general, so clever editing and dark shots create a very believable illusion.The film is great for the most part, the plot is straight forward, lovely wide shots of the locales and scenary, solid acting by the good guys / innocents, music has that franchise flair to it and it feels like a clash of styles as we switch to the italian side.The later half is let down by the bad guys, who are built up to be a nasty bunch backed up by muscle, slick hair cuts on flashy bikes and blacked out cars but in the end seriously underestimate one man.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","olcayozfirat","8 October 2023","As a fan of the series, I enjoyed it tremendously. While watching the movie lying down, I moved to a sitting position out of respect for McCall. My admiration for Denzel Washington reached its peak with the series. As they said they were going to force McCall in every movie, he took down the bad guys so easily, I swear I was filled with joy.And how beautiful the music in the finale was. It made me sad for an ending. However, I eagerly waited for the final music of the first movie, but it did not play. When the movie ended, I was sad that I would never have such a pleasant wait again.It is the 3rd and last movie of the series, produced in 2023. This time the movie takes place in Italy. Mccall came here again for some business and was shot by an accidental bullet. A person who finds him brings him to a doctor in a small town. During his recovery, Mccall sees the gang that haunts the town and begins to fight with his own methods.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","SoumikBanerjee1996","5 October 2023","Whenever the movie delved into action, or wherever the script decided to show its skill in showing blood and gore, every one of those instances begot some sequences that not only leave the audience in awe but also set a certain tone for the narrative to seek.However, every time it reverted to dramatic portions, less eventful segments of the script, so to speak, the intensity drops below expected levels, that impact is gone. The essence that was previously showcased is nowhere to be found. And that's primarily because of the weak writing (and an even weaker antagonist).Not to mention, the film, for the most part, came off as a grand advertisement for Italian Tourism rather than a full-fledged feature that was supposed to expand the 'Equalizer' universe!P. S. Denzel will do wonders as a psychopathic villain, I hope he gets to play one before he calls his retirement.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","cmkdakota-65369","17 September 2023","As a super fan of Equalizer parts one and two, I knew they had set the bar really high for this one. It's very hard for sequels to live up to the first one. Nevertheless, they did a very good job with this one by using a variety of venues to change it up a bit. First of all, the entire set and scene is in Italy.It is not daylight eye candy like in the current Greek wedding movie, but most of it takes place in a darker mode and for a good reason. There is one point when Denzel Washington is talking to a young misguided gang thug that the look upon his face is indescribable. Be forewarned that the movie is quite violent with lots of blood and gore and occasional rough language, but if you love a good David and Goliath movie, you will love this one. That is something else they've done very well: interweave the main character's sense of his obvious dedication to and faith in God with his mandate to spend much of his life slaughtering evil people.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","xxxxxdarkmoon","9 November 2023","Don't believe in extremely negative reviews and ratings. Haters gonna hate no matter what.If you enjoyed parts 1 and 2 of The Equalizer franchise, you'll love this final 3rd part.Part 3 takes it to the next level.I have to warn all people who have wrong expectations: This is NOT a non-stop action fireworks, like a superhero in a video game, when hundreds of enemies shoot at you, but all of their bullets miss. As it is happening in the almost simultaneously released John Wick 4 movie.Nevertheless, The Equalizer 3 is outstanding. This time around, Robert McCall seems to be more relentless towards the villains than ever before. And the reason for this is explained. The director took the time necessary to show why McCall does what he does. So the film is never in a hurry. But when it comes to the fight scenes, you'll see the most merciless Robert McCall you've ever seen. As mentioned before, the directory explains why that is, why Robert McCall is so relentless.However, the director does not make it seem like McCall is invulnerable. McCall almost dies in one of the scenes.This is the most emotional part of these three.I have to admit that I had tears in my eyes for the last 15 minutes. It's a good ending. McCall seems happy in the end. This is more than I expected. And, he tries as best he can NOT to be the hero. But he simply is.I also would like to mention that there are beautiful landscapes/images. The location is great. Great cinematography.So don't believe in extremely negative reviews and ratings. Haters gonna hate no matter what.","7/10"

If anything, they got the (extremely cringy) preachiness of original Robert McCall right, and not anything else.Odd enough, third installation of this series isn't half bad. It's slow and grounded, but this actually works really well for the title. McCall ends up in saving a small Italian coastal town from cartoonishly evil mafia, and save for some water-muddling with terrorism and CIA (that doesn't really matter nor work), contained plot and location turns out to be a really good idea. It's classic ""good, unarmed citizens vs. Evil baddies"", much like any 1980's show -- including some episodes of original ""The Equalizer"".Running at pleasant length of under 2 hours, almost everything goes will with this title.

"The Equalizer 3","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","25 September 2023","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulRobert McCall (Denzel Washington) is living in seclusion in a small town in the Italian hills, hoping to put his violent, destructive past behind him. However, his peace is typically short lived, and after a violent altercation, he is granted refuge by Dr Arsio (Remo Girone.) The town is under attack from a protection racket run by a vicious local mafioso, and after a trip to the local winery, McCall also finds dogged federal agent Collins (Dakota Fanning), on his trail, who has a connection to his past that has relevance to his present position. It all builds up to an explosive final confrontation with the wrong-doers that will have a decisive outcome.Over a timespan of nearly ten years, The Equalizer, a modern day cinematic series adapted from a 70's television series, has become an established franchise that runs in the pantheon of recognised action staples. The director/star dynamic has remained a constant as well, with sixty plus lead star Washington in the lead, and director Fuqua at the helm in each. I trust most people would agree the original was the best, but the original director staying on seems to have recreated the magic for a significant number of fans, but surely everyone can agree three is the magic number.The sheer pointlessness of the whole thing overrides everything, a hollow, insincere effort seemingly seeking only to desperately appeal to fanboys for a quick buck. It repeats the formula of the first two films almost interchangeably, playing out in the most by-the-numbers manner possible, with nothing to make it stand out in its own right. Which is a surprising fault, given the sheer lack of action in the whole thing, with long, boring segments playing out, not punctuated with anything really stimulating in between. There's just nothing of oompth to the story, the villains or the hero. Denzel has the simmering intensity to lift anything, but even he feels drained in this.Everything I say about it, I could have said about the sequel, but that feels like an elevated experience compared to this lifeless, pointless exercise. Some entertaining, brutal action is all that gives it any sort of distinction. **","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","3 October 2023","Unlike The Equalizer 1 and 2, this film is surprisingly underwhelming. It's not just because it has less action compared to those movies, but because it has a plot which is haywire and hard to process. I still can't understand what the plot was about. Denzel is the only reason you should watch this if you're interested but otherwise this can be skipped as it fails both as an entertaining third part as well as an ordinary action film in general.The film's first 10-something minutes are spellbinding. I expected more of that, but I guess the makers needed to stop at that and release this as a short film instead. The action scene itself has been all over the promos and hence doesn't surprise you when you see it, but it's the only actual memorable part of the film.From there, it goes on a downward spiral because what follows is not a movie but a sequence of random, forgettable scenes. The first two movies not only had a lot of action, but their character drama was also on point. This is clearly missing here, and the film turns out to be dull. There's no suspense or thrill factor going on beyond the opening sequence, and even the finale fails to stand out. The villains were weak and at no point did I hate them.Robert McCall's desire for peace didn't carry much emotional weight either. I didn't feel any emotion by the time the film ended. This is a rare disappointment from Denzel Washington and has surprisingly nothing going in its favor except the locations, the actor himself as well as the few action scenes. It's pretty average and forgettable, and something I won't call a perfect film to end this franchise with. If they make another, I'll give it a watch just for Denzel and the first two movies which I have revisited multiple times. But this one... not really.","8/10"

It is tho made with unexpected style by terrific returning director Antoine Fuqua AND is set on Italy's beautiful Amalfi coast, in an idyllic community on which Washington recovers from another guardian angel type revenge mission. Returning writer Richard Wenk then has this community plagued by vile mafioso's (like Andrea Scarduzio & Andrea Dodero) so Washington has to get violent again (pulling in the CIA (Dakota Fanning) on the side). It's simple fare, but delivered with polished aplomb.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","subxerogravity","31 August 2023","Once again, Denzel brings the heat. He gives so much to do so little in order to make Robert McCall such an interesting character when all he really needed to be is a blunt weapon of destruction like John Wick, but Denzel is too good for that, and Antoine Fuqua goes with the flow making something perfectly structed for an actor of Denzel's Calibur. Don't have to be a fan or familiar with the other two movies to 100 percent enjoy number three, but familiarity with the other two movies does enhance small things that naturally tie all of them together.Denzel has to be around the same age Liam Neeson was when he did the first Taken film. With that said, I'm gonna need some more old Denzil taking names and the other thing.Well excited action flick.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","waityear","5 October 2023","There is nothing in it , except Washington. This is the worst movie. It has too much lengthy and meaningless shots that gives tour of Italian city,
There is not much action and its very limited.There is not real story and most conversation is also lengthy and meaning less.No character development as well.This is a very disappointing sequel
Don't waste your time and money.Better watch something else or spend money on something else.People will watch this just because of Washington and name of sequel number 3 to successful franchise.I belive that is it, this is end of this franchise
Denzel has great potential and I hope in future we see more acting like ""Training Day""","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","boblipton","14 November 2023","Denzell Washington is back in the role, killing people with ruthless efficiency in the service of people who can't defend themselves. This time he's in Sicily killing Mafia, but discovers an oddily: lots of drugs coming through one of the most secure ports in the world. Wounded, he makes his way, inexplicably, to Naples, where he recuperates and discovers some lovely people. But Camorra thugs burn down a fish market he's fond of, so he kills them, and finds himself in the hairs of the head of one of the Camorra clans. He also informs CIA operative Dakota Fanning of the drug situation.I will watch Denzell Washington in the most arrant nonsense. He is believable in any role he chooses to play, even MacBeth. However here, as in other recent action movies he has undertaken, he is under the direction of Antoine Fuqua, and I have issues with that. Fuqua invariabl gives the audience a lot of bloody scenes. Sometimes I try to convince myself he is spoofing the love of blood, or that he is offering the audience the sating of blood lust that Elizabethan revenge dramas did. I can never do so. He just likes offering bloody scenes in place of character or plot development. I also have issues with his dark lighting and muted color palette.So, it's a mixed effort, so far as I am concerned. And when Fuqua and Washington do their next ultra-violent movie, I'll see it, because of Washington.","1/10"
"The Equalizer 3","andrew-marks59","1 September 2023","Let's start out with the good. Denzel. C'mon, he's always good and in this he's still got it. Funny, hard-hitting, and a seemingly untouchable leading man.The bad speaks for itself if you end up watching it. The pacing is slow in the first half, the action is barely there, and it seemed even more unnecessary than the second Equalizer film.Let's just say you're writing a script and you introduce a large plot point that could severely cripple the lead character. Would you:A. Bring it up later to challenge the protagonist in a confrontation.B. Never address it again.You can probably guess what the screenwriter ended up choosing.McCall is good and in this he's too good. Not once was he challenged. He gives two beatdowns in the second half of the film without a scratch to himself. It's boring to watch and even harder to watch because the first half of the film was already a snooze.It's sort of like a non-film that prides itself in taking a crap on good times. The worst part is I paid to see it. I paid to get crapped on and I don't even usually like that sort of thing. Leave it to the people on Craigslist, they're the real professionals. Antoine Fuqua and his team, who are usually pretty good, decided that hiring professional wet workers and whatever their crap equivalent is, was too much of a bother.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","tim_sen","17 September 2023","I really enjoyed this film. I haven't actually seen the previous 2, but I saw Denzel Washington was the star and wanted to see this in the cinema, and I thought the acting and characters were great and the scenery was beautiful.There aren't that many action scenes but the ones there are are done really well. The villains are set up to be awful (the film does very well in doing that), so you want them to get what's coming to them.Without giving spoilers, most of the film is set in a small town in Italy, and it does a great job of showing us what life is like there and you really connect with the community. I'm very glad I watched this film and now I want to see the previous two!","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","aaaaaron-frannnnnnnn","7 September 2023","So, this movie was a good and fun action movie. After very heavy movies like Oppenheimer and political movies like Barbie, we needed a break. So Equalizer 3 was a breath of fresh air: Denzel happens upon a small and friendly town, which he protects from mobsters. No big twists, no messages - just a good movie with impressive kills and one-line speeches. This is not an ocscar movie, but nor was it trying to be. If you like watching a guy, who kills some bad guys, this movie is right up your alley.The small touch of Dakota Fannings character being the daughter of Denzel's friend in the first movie was nice.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","sammyadelaiye","5 September 2023","Very violent and fast paced and somehow feels like a punisher movie, but also feels like a worthy follow up to man on fire. The master & apprentice chemistry between Denzel and Dakota gave me flashes of their father-daughter like relationship in Man on fire. We see the protagonist more vulnerable, showing more emotion. The action scenes had me twitching and on the edge of my seat and the way the town is shot with the beautiful cathedrals and historical European architecture and streets I loved the supporting cast and the heavy themes of community and kindness. You may need a tissue, it's a surprisingly emotional ride.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","jon_anderson77","17 September 2023","Went into this with apprehension purely because in my opinion movies that move their location to Europe usually take a hit in quality (Rush Hour 3, Taken 2) but part 3 of the Equalizer really turned out to be the exception. Paced in such a way that the bad guys doing bad things builds the anticipation of the destruction you know is coming their way. Having McCall injured lends really well to Denzel who lets face it is getting on in years so prob doesn't want to be doing a lot of stunt work, not that there isn't any and when the action takes place it's impressive. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy what appears to be the end of the franchise I think it's actually my favourite of the 3. It's beautifully shot, the location and his intentions lend perfectly to the characters original role as a man helping others out of bad situations and the dispatching of the baddies when it happens is brutal and satisfying. If I had a complaint about plot it would be the end set piece could have been better and was a bit basic. The final boss got off far too lightly in my opinion. The conclusion of the first movie in the home depot type location is hard to beat for this and is just a great bit of cinema set to a brilliant soundtrack. Complaints wise. Dakota Fanning being in the movie was completely pointless and was obvious fan service for those who saw and love Man of Fire. She's a pretty terrible actress now despite being a pretty good child actor and they would have been better off casting someone else in the role especially as she is barely in it. Other than that it's one I look forward to owning and re watching when it's released on blu ray. Solid 8.5 for me.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","chand-suhas","5 October 2023","Back to basics and once again it has a simple story. Robert McCall is on his vigilante mission to find a cyber ghost and well he does. He rather uncovers a larger crime happening and gets shot while trying to leave. Badly injured, he almost loses his conscious when he is taken to a doctor by a Carabinieri at Altamonte. McCall bonds with the people there and feels this to be the place he belongs. Sadly the place is tormented by the local mafia and once again, poor mafia fails to figure out who they are messing with as McCall sets his timer on them.The film has basically two and a half action scenes rest filled with scenes where McCall gets himself acquainted to the new place and people, which takes most part of the film. This one amplifies the drama compared to the other 2 films and yet knows to play to it's strength. Almost an hour between the two action scenes might be tad bit boring but Denzel Washington ensures to get one hooked to the story. The villains well by the numbers are weakly written and no match to the lead character but then, the action scene kind of feels worth the wait.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","rebeltaz-18705","3 March 2024","Twenty minutes. That was as long as I could take it. The first Equalizer was great. The second one was pretty good. I had high hopes for this. I don't know why. There hasn't been a decent movie come out of hollywood in over a decade. But... I was hoping...For twenty minutes, I sat through an Italian language film. In that entire time, there was MAYBE a dozen words in English. I have no desire to READ a movie. If I want to read something, I'll pick up a book. As a matter of fact... that's exactly what I did as soon as I turned this off.The scenes that I did see jumped from one place to another with no rhyme nor reason. Denzel is in one diner having dinner. The next second he's in another street cafe having tea. We bounced all over Italy in the twenty minutes that I could sit through.There was absolutely no story whatsoever before I stopped watching. Whether there was EVER any story, I don't know, but by that point, I could NOT have cared less.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","kh-17438","5 January 2024","I have watched all the Equalizer movies, Equalizer 1, 2, and now 3. It seems sometimes bad guys win and dominate in real life so watching them die extremely violent deaths in the Equalizer movies seems fair and just in the not so real life.I'm older now and aware of when people are acting and Denzel's Equalizer movies make me forget he is a character. It's not that I am going to stand up in my living room and cheer him on and my best compliment I can give a movie is I look up the ending while I am watching to make sure it is not awful. I'm investing my time and don't want to waste it. The night I started Equalizer 3 I had left my phone in my sister's car so I had to fast forward to the end to make sure Denzel made it out okay, and then I had to go back the next night and watch it again. Which was tonight. I loved it!","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","RonellSowes","7 January 2024","Granted in the overwhelming majority of action movies the hero gets all the bad days and lives happily etc. However, there can at least be a little, unlikely bit of jeopardy if they're not superhuman-like Robert McCall. If you've seen the previous movies you know what you're getting into here, but either way the fiona demonstrates his omnipotence at the very start. Opening on the carnage of some dozen henchman he's just killed before he disposes of the last few from a chair with guns pointed right at him; all in a matter of precisely timed seconds. This guy obviously has nothing to worry about with the small town goons he deals with the rest if the movie. The action is hard hitting though far fetched and just because it uses a lot of blood doesnt make it realistic. Pretty much everything about only works if you think about it as little as these filmmakers did. The lulls in between the action, perhaps to flesh the movie out, only serve as a halt. And this movie adds all the usual trivialities to increase our care but as always, ultimately the only reason we're interested is Denzel Washington.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","hoernkeem","31 January 2024","Eric's Grade: C-
This is the third installment in the popular 'Equalizer' film series starring Denzel Washington in his continuing effort to have Liam Neeson's action career. 'Equalizer 3' is directed by Antoine Fuqua who directed the previous two installments. This is yet another project that was delayed to COVID-19, but finally got filmed in 2022 and released in 2023. Along with Washington the most notable costar who shows up is Dakota Fanning who starred with him 19 years previous in 'Man on Fire'. Even though Washington's action hero is showing his age, he is still a popular, bankable movie star as 'Equalizer 3' took in $191 million dollars at the box office.Washington stars once again as avenger of the downtrodden Robert McCall, and in an introductory action scene he takes out a gangster at a winery in Sicily, but he is injured. He winds up rescued by a local peace officer on mainland Italy. He is taken to a secluded town on the Amalfi coast to convalesce. As he recuperates he begins to become more enamored with the town and the local populace. He notices the townsfolk being intimidated by the Camorra which is essentially the mafia. McCall takes this personally and eventually must spring into action to protect this town from the villains that would exploit it.I had heard good things about this movie, but I found it lacking throughout. First off and most glaring is that Denzel is really showing his age here, and it begins to be more difficult to by him as a one man action dynamo. The action set pieces here did not impress that much. It is hard to buy that this one man is battling essentially organized crime. It feels more like he is just cleaning up the streets of a small overly aggressive gang and not one of the most feared criminal organizations in Europe. Additionally the whole inclusion of Fanning's character and the CIA angle to the plot feels entirely inconsequential and nonessential to the story of McCall trying to protect this town. I can still buy Robert McCall protecting people from a group of baddies that would do them harm, but this plot tries to be too large for its own good, and McCall's mission becomes unbelievable by extension. Denzel Washington is getting a bit long in the tooth to make an action film like this seem anywhere near plausible. It is still possible but his character has to pivot using wits more than brute force and in your face violence. It is a dual edged sword though because this series is built on intelligent violence, and unfortunately the action here is as weak as plot. The movie is watchable and mildly entertaining, but not as good as we really want it to be.","6/10"

"The Equalizer 3","markomiklic-93837","4 October 2023","If the idea was to make a movie where Denzel comes to Italy to find his peace, and to meet some people who embrace him, only to find out that some scumbags give them the hard time, and then he wipes them out in trademark Equalizer fashion, it would be everything you would expect this movie to be.What happens instead is, the movie tries to be more than that, and the result is that it falls flat on both the action part (there are literally 3 action scenes which last like 5 minutes altogether), and the plot is so lame and contrived that by the time the credits rolled, I was like ""What the heck was that about?"".Enjoy the opening scene, which is the only ""Equalizer"" part of the movie. If you stay beyond that, get ready to watch Denzel drinking tea in a bar for over an hour.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","kgprophet","18 October 2023","Spoilers AheadDenzel Washington has been an A list actor who almost consistently chose projects that wouldn't disappoint his audience. His strong acting skills bring integrity to the Equalizer franchise, and consistently deliver on the goods. The third outing received mostly good reviews, with the caveat that we should expect more of the same. The setup is appealing, our hero is stuck in a lovely little town in Sicily. The bulk of the film shows Denzel becoming friendly with the locals. It is no wonder why the majority of the running time shows him interacting with the supporting cast. Denzel has a natural charm, but a somewhat foreboding presence, and it works well here.Because of the main character's actions, he has the potential to bring trouble to this peaceful community. But here is one of the points in the story that isn't really exploited to it's full potential. Similar points in this refreshing take on the retribution genre are left unexplored. A sympathetic doctor is seen as a respected elder in the town. There is a tiny hint of his military history. He should have been more involved fighting the mafia gang that harasses local merchants. Another missed opportunity is Dakota Fanning's CIA character. She has a vulnerability reminiscent of Starling from ""Silence of the Lambs"". She is a fish out of water when she comes to Italy. She needed to have a more hands-on situation in tracking down the bad guys. For instance, we find out she is a marked for a hit by the mafia. This could have been realised as a more tense action sequence than what does occur. Sadly, her screen time is very limited.There was also something missing in Denzel's character as he witnesses the harassment. I think his moral dilemma could have been explored more. With an Oscar winner leading the way, the potential for a more serious crime drama, ""Godfather"" style is missing here. As Denzel's character finally carries out the retribution, the large scale showdown we all expected doesn't happen.Major SpoilerWe instead are supposed to accept that this large mafia figure's compound has only one aloof bodyguard standing at the main gate. Without first checking in, he opens the gate and lazily checks out a car alarm. Denzel, or anybody for that matter, easily takes out the one guard and waltzes into the compound unnoticed. The subsequent killing spree didn't rise above expectations. I thought to myself ""OK there will be the surprise confrontation at the end of the film"". We are made to believe the story has been resolved and everyone lives happily ever after. Maybe when Denzel goes back to Boston. But no. It turns out all the buildup, with the likeable Doctor, the CIA chick, the Shop Owner, The Young Cop, and others, are left on the wayside through most of the third act. Likewise, with the inevitable comparison to the John Wick franchise, the action sequences are too quick and on a smaller scale than you would expect. Or, if compared to the ""Taken"" franchise, Denzel doesn't have a hero moment rescuing the CIA agent from peril.The lack of more action is curious, since this film should have had a large enough budget. So ultimately I have tag this production as lazy. For instance, the majority of Denzel's scenes have him sitting comfortably, usually at a small cafe. Even when confronting the bad guys. I understand Denzel is in his elder years, but his character works better being more agile. The same for the Doctor with the military past. He could have been more involved with confronting the gang. It would've be an effectively shocking moment in the story if the beloved Doctor was killed by the gang (which I thought was the case when someone is left to hang outside a broken window). This would create a really strong reaction by the townspeople, and more importantly, motivate Denzel's character to take action.So sadly, an underwhelming script with Denzel shown mostly enjoying his Italian vacation, is only mildly interesting as the designated bad guys are knocked off in interesting ways. All that was really left was the gorgeous cinematography of this photogenic Italian coastal town. I hesitate to not recommend this low scale revenge flick, since it is made better than most of these types of films with numbers at the end of their titles However I still give it a 5 out of 10.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","isaacsundaralingam","1 September 2023","Denzel Washington was first Robert McCall 9 years ago. And with this third instalment in what can be described as a decent enough action franchise, he's finally hanging up the gloves.Directed by Antoine Fuqua; who also made the first two movies, The Equalizer 3 is probably everything you'd have come to expect; from Denzel's charismatic performance set against a generic enough plot, to decent action, hit-or-miss dialogues, uncompelling motivations and a 'sure why not' climax. It's fun and never boring, but it's also never that great either.Is it sad that we'll probably never get to see Denzel being Robert McCall again? Not really, but was it fun seeing Denzel be Robert McCall for three movies? Yes, absolutely.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","diotwell-87102","4 September 2023","This third and final movie is well acted and well directed. I loved that McCall was not turned into some sort of super hero, but a man feeling his years who really wants to rest. Yet, again he must equalize. The villians were brutal, so he uses the same brutality to stop their terror.Fanning was excellent. She did not over act, and it was good to see them together again working to save the village.Normally long build ups bore me, but not this time.

"The Equalizer 3","Neptune165","2 December 2023","The Equalizer is such a high impact movie. If three is Denzels last one, I feel they should continue the story line with the girl. She knows him better than anyone. Denzel as the equalizer puts so much passion into every scene, it's hard to see it come to an end. Job well done! Played with compelling depth by Denzel Washington. This film transforms the typical action hero into a figure of complex introspection. Director Antoine Fuqua artfully blurs the lines between McCall's hard-edged vigilante justice and his reflective, almost philosophical side. Here, McCall is not just a dispenser of justice; he's a man in a contemplative battle with himself, questioning the morality and impact of his actions. Washington's performance elevates McCall beyond the typical action fare. He brings a thoughtful, almost introspective quality to the character, turning him into a kind of warrior-poet amid chaos. The film's style mirrors this complexity, combining straightforward action with moments that verge on the surreal. Ultimately, 'Equalizer 3' stands out as a thought-provoking paradox, offering both a thrilling ride and a contemplative character study. It's a narrative that engages the audience on multiple levels, encouraging both serious reflection and a subtle appreciation for its deeper nuances.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","arungeorge13","4 October 2023","Yeah, the action is less this time around. Yeah, the supporting characters are lacking. Yeah, the antagonists are one-note. But, can anyone question Denzel's screen presence? The man effortlessly swings between being the sweetest human being in one scene and the most deadly assassin in another. It was also nice to see Dakota Fanning reunite with Denzel (a wonderful callback to Man on Fire), and their exchanges, though meant to be expository, carry a warmth that's hard to brush aside. The action blocks are assigned only when they're absolutely needed, and that was indeed a pleasant surprise. We know Denzel's 68, and we don't need to see him doing anything over-the-top (even within the logical confines of the series' universe) at this point.Robert Richardson's cinematography captures the quaint beauty of Italian towns, with some truly fantastic night shots. Marcelo Zarvos, a more recent Denzel and Fuqua collaborator, adds a bit of grunge to the mafioso proceedings. All that said, the emotional stakes are comparatively on the lower side. The Sicilian neighborhood (and its people) comes across as endearing, but we don't exactly know what particular incident triggers McCall where he, once again, decides to take things into his own hands. Well, I guess these films aren't meant to be much more than forgettable-yet-enjoyable fare.. and Denzel & Co. At least know when to call it a day.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","mfeierskov","22 October 2023","A different, but very good entry into the series. The character growth across the three movies is subtle, but noticable and that's why the different tome of this movie works very well. Even though there is less action than the previous movies, the pacing is great, and it's not at all boring. Seeing Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning in the same shot 20 years after Man on Fire, was honestly kind of an emotional moment, because of how amazing that movie is.Even though I've enjoyed the series very much, I hope they don't make a fourth. This would be a good place to end it knowing that McCall would have found a home, friends and possibly love.They kept the door open for a continuation of the franchise with the way he passed the torch to Dakota Fanning, but I don't really think they will do it, since she wasn't really a field operator, and it would seem out of place for her to carry on an action franchise.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","deruytergilles","12 January 2024","I thought the film was good, it was perhaps a bit shorter than the previous films, but like every time, Denzel Washington does not disappoint. I thought the film was a good addition to the full story and had me on the edge of my seat again. The action remains sublime, they could perhaps have gotten more out of the film to extend the story a bit, but all in all it was still a good movie.They did their best to make the film consistent with the two previous films, even though it is in a different setting and a completely different place.If you want a good action film with a good story, this film ticks a lot of boxes.I never really write reviews about films, even though I have seen a lot of films and I do have an opinion, I may not always dare to share it, but everyone has a different taste in films of course. I am writing this review because I definitely want to see a 4th movie with Denzel and see how Denzel's story comes to a complete conclusion. Because I think we now have an open ending again and don't really have an ending.Here is my personal opinion: if they plan to make a 4th movie then it should be with Denzel and otherwise they shouldn't start it. No one can replace Denzel in this series.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","thongman","1 October 2023","Denzel is once again classic Robert McCall in this kick their asses thriller. Dakota Fanning is all grown up and beautiful, handling an adult role. All in a backdrop of southern Italy, it's an amazing location. The villains are your typical idiots not knowing whom they are dealing with and certainly try to be the badasses that wan to be in their own minds. It's a good movie and has some genuine times you can see Robert McCall falling in love with the people of this small village as his appreciation of them grows. Check it out while it's still at the theaters or wait for dvd release or streaming, it's worth seeing any way you view it.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","mason25","23 October 2023","As a man who loves a great action movie, and the previous movies had more, I may have been expecting a bit more out of this than I got, it was still a good movie.Regarding the above, I was hoping for more hand to hand combat, and a bit more for action sequences. Though understanding that this was intended to show Robert's growth and acceptance of actually wanting to settle down, it did this very well.It was easy to see how much he only wanted to live in peace and he went for exceptionally quick and efficient kills with minimal risk to himself. It was even a bit anticlimactic for the final showdown.This movie was shot in such an amazing location all I could think about was needing to take a vacation or to move to Italy and just learn about all of the interesting sites and areas.I hope they don't try to continue the series indefinitely. Each movie has been great, but I don't feel that it could continue and feel like Robert has made progress in what he believes.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","free_man_ever","15 September 2023","This storyline was better than The Equalizer 2, that soundtrack that keeps coming whenever violence arrives was so outstanding! Even the little funny lines or sense of humor had the theater burst a laughter as if it was a comedy movie, I guess Denzel's charismatic acting and his facial expressions helps a lot in that humor side of the film. The villain was a little soft and easy that's the only little negative in my review. The graphic violence looked disgusting in a good way.The reunion of Denzel and Dakota was a very special nostalgic choice. Watch the movie

"The Equalizer 3","Cinema-reviewer321","4 October 2023","I liked the first movie The Equalizer (2014) and thought it was a cool action movie starring Denzel Washington, and the sequel The Equalizer 2 (2018) was ok and not as good as the first, but Denzel Washington was the best part of the movie. Now on the third and last movie for the Equalizer movies, I thought The Equalizer 3 (2023) was as good as the first film with it being an entertaining action movie but also a good ending to this trilogy of films. I also liked how Denzel Washington's character Robert McCall is trying to retire and be at peace in Italy, but he must deal with this Italian mafia terrorizing this town in Rome.Once again Denzel Washington as Robert McCall is great in the movie, and I like how his character is thinking about what he is doing and if what he does is a good thing or terrible thing, even if it means protecting other people. Though there are cool action scenes, there are not that many, and we get to see Robert McCall making friends and helping people in the town in Italy and is trying to stop certain situations in a nicer less violent way, but if that does not work, he will have to resort to violence. Also, I liked Dakota Fanning's character Emma Collins; she was an FBI agent that was good at her job, and I liked the interactions between her and Rober McCall with certain situations involving the Italian mafia and how they are affecting the residents of the town.The main antagonists being the Italian mafia, they are standard villains that do not have much about them, other than they take whatever they want from the people of the town and hurt them whenever they can. When there are action scenes, they are fast and brutal with Denzel Washington doing a fantastic job in them giving them his all, and the ways he is killing people are creative and bloody. The movie has better pacing than the second film and is shorter than the earlier two films; where the second movie felt slow with its pacing and felt longer than it should, this movie felt fast when it needed to be and had a good runtime of one hour and forty-nine minutes.The Equalizer 3 (2023) was nice conclusion for this trilogy of films and it was better than the second film along with it be as good as the first movie; Denzel Washington was great, I liked how Robert McCall is trying to live a peaceful life, the action scenes were cool and violent, and I liked the location being Italy. If you liked the last two films, you would like this; people will like seeing Denzel Washington back in the lead role for the last time, and like the cool action like the other two films. The Equalizer films are not perfect action movies or anything like that, but they are well done action movies that I would suggest checking out if you have not already.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","sambofett","9 September 2023","What can I say, this is a very well written story about an iconic hero figure that really excels in all departments.Plot, simple usual story, the equaliser wants to help those in need and the mission he is in doesn't actually become apparent until near the end, adding a great twist along the way.Then he finds a beautiful Italian town to recover in and makes friends with everybody and then has to step in to help those that need it to save the town from the usual mafia types
It was good to see him connect with so many, to once again exact justice on those that think they are untouchable
Spoiler alert, there would be room for more lol.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","pokerface-49204","1 September 2023","What a nice movie, beautiful story and showing italian culture, and Mr Mcallann never disappoint you!! Compared to the exhilarating action unfolding on screen, the action movie delivers an extraordinary cinematic experience. Moments of tension and adrenaline grip the viewer from start to finish, keeping them glued to their seat. The incredible choreography of action scenes, creative use of special effects, and engaging soundtrack all come together to create an immersive atmosphere that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats.While the film transports us to fantasy worlds, it's also worth mentioning the rich Italian culture that draws from a captivating history and deep-rooted traditions. Italy is renowned for its exquisite cuisine, ranging from pasta dishes like spaghetti and lasagna to delights like pizza and gelato. Each region in Italy boasts its own culinary specialty, reflecting the country's diversity.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Luigi Di Pilla","16 March 2024","Even the beautiful landscapes of Naples coasts couldn't change that the story was very poor written. There was one meaningful flaw that I will not spoil further here. I missed the dynamic of suspense but they delivered instead unnecessary much blood and violence. Even the characters didn't come out sometimes really cool.I think It could have been done much more.As an Italian I liked very much the spoken Italian dialect. The filming locations were wonderful but it lacked with colors. I mean the quality of cinematography was not fine and I didn't like the soundtrack. Denzel Washington looked older but I would say he saved perhaps this action thriller from a complete disaster. That's why we gave 6/10.The third Equalizer is no doubt the worst of this trilogy.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","BoBo_Goal32","14 October 2023","The third time Denzel Washington has performed as Robert McCall was the time I thought the magic will vaporize. Didn't happen. He still got it and especially because it is him as the main character. And also, because it is Antoine Fuqua, which held the director's reins for this movie.McCall is destroying, once again, an evil mob cell in Sicily, but gets hurt and find himself recovering in a small town, near Naples and close to the sea. He thinks that he would retire quietly and far away from home, but the Camorra mafia has other plans for him, when he witnesses how they tare apart the nice community, which gave him the peace and silence to get back to normal.We all know were it is heading, but still Denzel manages to be very dominant and influence the final outcome and result of the movie, which could have easily dropped and crashed without him.It is well written, though the common sense was dropped of once the movie began. No one cares because each and every one who came to see the movie, has arrived to see Denzel kick some asses and he definitely does.The movie is extremely violent but shorter then the last two and were he could have gone wrong, the trusting directing hand of Fuqua corrects and of course there are not a lot of actors as Washington that can salvage this caliber of a movie at Hollywood these days - he totally does it.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","refinedsugar","1 November 2023","Let's talk about the 'Equalizer' series. The bread 'n butter is great acting mixed with a moral brand of action featuring a formidable villain. Denzel Washington returns for the third entry which doesn't dress itself up with some unnecessary subtitle. The original went foreign for it's villains. The first sequel '2' stayed domestic. Now the whole enterprise has gone overseas, but does it make a difference?Robert McCall (Washington) finds himself down and out in Italy after his latest quest for justice leaves him shot in the back. Recuperating he informs CIA Specialist Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning) about what he unintentionally stumbled on while he grows to love the quiet little fictional city of Altamonte he's in. The people welcome him with their friendly, open arms. Of course, it doesn't take long for the local mob to cross paths with him endangering those he newly cares about.I'll be upfront that I wasn't thrilled when the trailer dropped for this movie and it revealed they were going overseas. I didn't see a need for it and I've sat thru too many movies about a one man army battling the mob. Being in Italy allows for some culture, beautiful sights, but it doesn't affect the underlying elements on a real level. You don't have to go across the pond to deal with issues of corruption, organized crime and terrorism.Like I said this series lives and breathes on good acting, a moral brand of action and good villains. Denzel, Dakota and a cast of relatively unknown Italian actors bring home the drama, but the action takes a while to build and falters once it occurs without stronger villains. They're not developed. One note, cliche. There's not much satisfying weight to the revenge as well. It feels low energy at times.There's a heartful moment at the end that ties the story together full circle, but 'Equalizer 3' doesn't capture the height of the original film. The tone is an improvement from the last entry, but it's still stuck with unremarkable bad guys and story. This entry slides right into generic territory despite itself.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","kolzgb","4 October 2023","Big Denzel fan, and enjoyed the first 2 instalments of The Equaliser but this one just failed to impress.The main thing for me is that it lacked the same hand-to-hand combat that the first two brought ...there just wasn't enough of it, compared to what we were offered previously.Is it that Denzel is too old for that now? The second movie was only 5 years ago. Tom Cruise in comparison is still going strong and he's only 7 years younger. I suppose at 68, that's quite old, but I don't know, that's what stunt doubles are for, right?Anyway, it was disappointing. A lot more gun use this time than real fighting, which is what made Equalizer great.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","akshatmahajan","3 November 2023","I enjoyed the original movie as it was a proper blend of action and drama. This second installment felt short in delivering the same product as the story had less depth and was less effective. This third installment was better than second one. In this one, they focused more on drama and less on action.The screenplay was good, the direction was simple and the performances also ranged from average to good. Denzel's performance was good like the original and it was sufficient to make this simple story more effective.Overall, the movie was enjoyable and you should definitely give this movie a try.","9/10"

"The Equalizer 3","paah1944","6 September 2023","Denzel Washington does not make crook movies I have never seen him in anything even mediocre. This effort is slow to catch fire. It is no John Wick more the Jason Bourne style. Denzel uses his facials to get his message through. The collection of bad guys well placed and they all look uber fit. A few old gems used to best effect. A predictable ""Taken"" style retribution is the go. The savagery is eked out at the right pace. As usual Denzel often bites his lip to message body electrics. It is pleasing that the good guys do not end up being the bad guys for a change. The array of painful but effective weapons is as expected in this one. Photography was not real crisp with dark blue hues. A fitting finale to this trilogy. The end is a think back and memorable

"The Equalizer 3","mrglenngrant","8 November 2023","As a fan of the first two films I was looking forward to this one ... and it doesn't disappoint.The beginning is a bit of a shocker with the kid shooting Denzel in the back. A real 'Whoa!!' moment and I was expecting a '3 months earlier' thing but no ... the story carries right along.Obviously our intrepid hero doesn't die but finds his way into the hearts of the prettiest little Italian village and it's occupants - or vice versa. The characters that become his friends are all just ... lovely.His battle with the local mafia to protect the village and it's occupants isn't really anything new but, as always, is very well done. My only negative comment is that it somehow seemed a little bit too easy.There's not as much 'action' per se in this movie. Denzel is getting up in years I suppose. Still fabulous.Nice reveal at the end with the CIA woman being a call-back as the daughter of his old boss.Props again for the beautiful Italian location(s). It's a wonderful film to look at, that's for sure.79/100.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Amadeus01","4 February 2024","Like everyone else, I watched the first two installments of the franchise so I thought, for completeness, I'll watch the third one.The storyline is ridiculous, the Italian overacting is farcical and, sadly, Denzel is 70 this year, and he does not look younger. He can barely walk, the plot which required him to walk with a cane was probably on purpose.I am sure I will get dunked on by a lot of Denzel fans, Denzel was great in several movies (Philadelphia, Training Day, Crimson Tide) but he was already too old in Equalizer 1. This one is some 10 years later and it's painful to watch. I mean I want to give him a coffee and a cake and a blanket, and not see him implausibly eviscerate a gang of strong looking young men in their twenties.There is a lot more to complain about here but I just leave it here. Good luck to Denzel and his health. Let's get some non-geriatric action movies please?","8/10"

Denzel was Denzel, Robert McCall was Robert McCall, the bad guys all ended up dead and we got some nice Italian scenic shots.My post is more about the difficulty in rating a film like this where the artistic, creative aspects are straight jacketed by the franchise. I watched it because i was pretty sure about what i was going to see and i was also pretty sure i was going to enjoy it and i was right on both counts.However, there was a little bit of character development. Denzel was visibly older and his character was also. A retiree ready for a place in the sun (literally) where he could rest and live out his golden years.

"The Equalizer 3","dr_ahmed_elshamy","14 September 2023","In the world of cinema, there are those movies that leave you breathless, clinging to the edge of your seat, and ultimately make you believe in the power of good triumphing over evil.

This movie, an action-packed thriller, has the ability to stun its audience with its compelling portrayal of the eternal battle between good and bad. What's more, the acting in this film is nothing short of spectacular, especially considering its action genre roots. At the heart of this cinematic marvel is the incomparable Denzel Washington, who stands head and shoulders above his contemporaries. To sum it up, I'm thoroughly impressed, and I give it a well-deserved round of applause üëè.One of the most remarkable aspects of this movie is the way it redefines the concept of good triumphing over evil.

The storytelling is nothing short of brilliant, with a narrative that unfolds seamlessly, revealing deeper layers of complexity as the movie progresses.The characters in this film are well-developed and multi-dimensional. Denzel Washington, in particular, delivers a performance that can only be described as awe-inspiring. His portrayal of the protagonist is nothing short of a tour de force. Denzel brings depth, gravitas, and charisma to his character, making us root for him from the very beginning. His ability to convey a wide range of emotions through his acting is truly remarkable, and it's clear that he is in a league of his own when it comes to his craft.What sets Denzel apart from other actors is his consistency in delivering exceptional performances.

"The Equalizer 3","TharsheyN","15 October 2023","The Equalizer 3 is a thrilling addition to the franchise, and Denzel Washington once again delivers a masterclass in action and character depth. As a longtime fan of the series (Ever since I saw Chlo√´ Grace Moretz in the 1st one), I couldn't be happier with this latest installment. As sad as it is that this is the final film of the series, it ends in a lovely spot for both our hero and the storyline.The storyline is great and keeps the movie moving along at the perfect pace. It ties up the trilogy perfectly while ensuring the film is still fun and enjoyable for all. The movie is engaging and layered, delving into themes of justice, redemption, and the consequences of one's past actions. The film successfully weaves in elements of suspense and mystery, making it more than just another action movie. The pacing is well-balanced, with moments of intense action followed by quieter, character-driven scenes that provide a breather and allow for character development. The cinematography and editing are top-notch, contributing to the overall cinematic experience.Denzel Washington reprises his role as Robert McCall, the ex-CIA operative with a heart of gold. His character's evolution is striking, and this film gives him a chance to showcase both his impeccable combat skills and his emotional depth. Robert's strong moral compass remains the driving force behind the storyline. Denzel without a doubt makes the movie and the trilogy as a whole what it is. The whole Robert McCall having OCD is something Denzel Washington purposely came up with and added to his character.We have Eugenio Mastrandrea playing Gio Bonucci and Dakota Fanning playing Emma Collins (A character that is absolutely critical to the story and trilogy for veteran Equalizer fans). The supporting cast as a whole all do a brilliant job as well, so props to them for ensuring that their character portrayals were also entertaining and convincing.The VFX and SFX is absolutely brilliant and the action sequences are expertly choreographed and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. Director Antoine Fuqua's ability to build tension and deliver intense confrontations is spot on, and The Equalizer 3 is no exception. The fight scenes are visceral and satisfying, combining hand-to-hand combat with the environment and strategic thinking.Overall I give the film a well deserved 9/10. If you're a fan of Denzel Washington and the Equalizer series you will love it. The movie keeps the franchise fresh and exciting, and Denzel's performance reminds us why he's one of the greatest actors of our time. With its compelling characters, well-executed action, and a thought-provoking plot, this film is definitely worth the watch!","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","KarlsW66","5 November 2023","As a big fan of the franchise and a big denzel fan, I was really looking forward to watching this third installment.I didn't really have any expectation, one of my friends recommended it and said it was really goodI cannot even begin to express my disappointment. When the end credits rolled ,I didn't feel anything ,just numb.For a start the movie is incredibly slow, unecessarily slow and the whole of the first 10 minute segment didn't even need to happen and had no relevance to the rest of the movie.And then we spend a lot of time with Robert just walking around with a walking stick observing.And where on earth is (and I think you all know what I'm talking about) the classic equaliser soundtrack evident in the first two movies?? It's totally absent.The action sequences are ok, but there's very little in the way of any action and the finale left me wanting more. I just thought, is that it?Dakota Fanning was not very good in this movie either ,very wooden acting and I think another actress, any other actress, would have been more fitting for the part .Horribly disappointed. I don't recommend it. I've rated it 5 out of 10 and I think I'm being a little generous.","6/10"

This may have been a cinema mistake, although I am unsure. Because of the lack of subtitles, it was very difficult to follow the plot.It was very tame action-wise compared to the others. It could get quite gory at some points, but nowhere near the level of action from Denzel that you get in the first two films.

"The Equalizer 3","DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed","2 September 2023","What an Opening.Here's what I liked about the Film.1. Denzel Washington as always is Excellent, he has multiple bits of Great snappy Dialogue.2. ""I understand Weakness, I understand Pain, I Understand Suffering, I Understand Death and upon Getting to know these people, Im starting to Understand Peace"" - Just Sheer Force and Power From Denzel.3. It was Great to See a Fully Grown Dakota Fanning Reuniting with Denzel in another Film, even some of the Dialogue ""I'll find the Answers and Circle Back to You"". As well as Circling back to Robert McCall with the Answers, She Circles in real life, Back to Denzel Washington from Man on Fire to Equalizer 3 üëå4. The Table Scene with Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning, Again, Great dialogue between the two and a Couple of Funny Moments too.5. The Progression of Denzel Slowly Healing over time, going from Terrible Shape, to Decent Shape, to Back to Full Health was Great to See. The Different shots of him going up the Stairs or shots of him just sitting down on a bench for a rest before continuing up the stairs, were nice camera shots, a Nice vibe.6. The overall Cinematography and Camera Angles were Great to See at times.7. The Score was Good in Certain Scenes.8. There are a Couple of Impactful ""Out of Nowhere"" Action Bits, Car Explosion, Van Brutally Ramming a Mafia Member into Wall etc.9. The Opening was So Good, the slow Reveal of the Dead Bodies and the look on that Guys Face as he Walks through slowly, I loved the feel of that scene. It Set Everything In Motion Nicely.Here's what Brings the Film Down -1. The Villain and his Brother are One Dimensional as Hell, no personality or Flavour whatsoever. They are Brutal and that's it, no depth whatsoever.2. The Climax. You call that a Climax? It Just Ends out of Nowhere. The Climax Needed to Be Strong. On top of that, it was a Completely Missed Opportunity. The Script could of had the Villain Written in to Be, walking through the Streets in front of the Whole Village and Paraded around, and the Villagers Finally Get their Revenge.Overall, it was a nice Relaxing Film and if you bear in Mind that this is a Trilogy (Overarching Through Line) whilst watching, with that in Mind, it's not actually Bad, it's ok.","6/10"

Denzel's acting is great as we all expect from him. The end of the trilogy is not what I expected and surprisingly a more dramatic way was taken from the team which I liked, but this is subjective. Good directing and good depicting of the relationship between human and god form the director. Photography is very good and special too. This movie left me with some thoughts regarding, what make us live in a place? The people or the place itself? Maybe a combination of these two? I think it's the people though. You should watch and find your answer.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","mata7-1","8 January 2024","Equalizer 3 stands out from its prequels. It does not have the same kind of tone as the previous films, it doesn't ""set everything up"" before we get to the violent parts, here we seem to skip some character development and instead just go straight to the violent parts.It also doesn't have the same musical score like the previous one, or should I say the same ""kind"" of score. This score lacks gravitas, a lot has to do with the movies missing ""the equalizer"" theme from the first movies. And Harry Gregson-Williams is surprisingly missing from this movie. I'd really love to know what happened. Was Gregson-Williams just busy, was he tired of the movies or did the relationship with the director sour? This movie really suffer because of the exclusion of Gregson-Williams' score.I do not think this was a fitting end to the Equalizer story. I would rather like to forget that this movie even exists. But, it does have Denzel Washington in it, so there's that.","9/10"

"The Equalizer 3","dh-51489","16 October 2023","The director absolutely nailed this, the third - and apparently last outing - for Denzel Washington as Robert McCall.Deciding to get straight into it, rather than waste time on some sort of origin explanation, we see the aftermath of an entanglement with The Equalizer. Any disappointed you might feel for being cheated out of the action is quickly laid to rest, as McCall promptly lays everyone still alive to rest - bar one. And this triggers - forgive the pun - the situation that leads to the film's main storyline.I started this review by claiming that the director nailed this and I'd like to elaborate. While The Equalizer franchise is about action, it's even more about the satisfaction that comes with brutal justice. The director not only does a fantastic job of capturing the heart and soul of provincial Italy, he also provides us with characters you absolutely loath, leaving you chomping at the bit to see how and when McCall is going to 'punish' them for their bad behaviour. This balancing act between building the frustration that comes with tyranny - and the satisfactory release felt when justice is dealt - is a genuine credit to the director.The only thing I don't like about this film is the thought that it was the last.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","pedromiguelaafonso","2 September 2023","I don't agree with the assessment given by the Metascore website because the film is sensational in terms of its script, theme and Denzel's superb performance. A fantastic Equalizer triology emding. I highly recommend this film, which grips the viewer from the first minute to the end of this great film. Could not be better than i have opportunity of watch today. It was a evaluation i gave here. I've seen other films with this gentleman of cinema, and he's never disappointed me. He deserves every film award he gets in the future.Conclusion: We can't value the critics, because everything depends on what the great film critics value, but rather the opinion of the people who have seen the film.","6/10"
"The Equalizer 3","JayWolfgramm","28 November 2023","Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington complete their Equalizer Trilogy. These movies are not trying to reinvent the wheel or be some sort of highbrow cinema. You will not see this making the rounds when it comes time for Oscar Bait. And there is nothing wrong with that. These movies, all three, are just good straight forward action. Simple stuff, you set up the villains, make them despicable people that we want to see fail. Then throw in Washington as Robert McCall and have him give them the blunt end of a fist full of karma. The story is nothing new, but it is well acted, well shot and overall a fine time.","2/10"

"The Equalizer 3","movieman6-413-929510","3 September 2023","The Equalizer 3 Is the third film Equalizer film of the series and is again directed by Antoine Fuqua, who also directed the two previous films.During his latest mission, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is injured and cared for by Italian doctor Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone). Since then he has been recovering in the village of Altamonte in Sicily. In this way he has built up a relationship with the people of the village.Robert later learns that some residents are being oppressed by the mob. To thank the inhabitants for the help they have given him, he tries to protect them against these mafia figures.With this third Equalizer film, Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington return for what is probably the last time in this film series. The second Equalizer movie was a bit unclear due to the lesser story, because there were several separate storylines in that movie. The Equalizer also tried to help different people, with different things. Fortunately, this third Equalizer has a more focused story. Because the Equalizer is more recovering, this film does have a slower story. For example, Robert does more research into mafia cases than he really tries to counter them right away. This happens more towards the end of the film, but then the pace suddenly picks up quickly. Despite a more focused story, this third film has a slower pace. The film has its long-winded moments.Robert also collects more information for the CIA and then passes it on to CIA agent Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning). Their cooperation just doesn't really come forward as if they really are a mutual team. After Robert passes on the clues, the CIA only seems to catch the criminals more or make their actions more public to the world. The isolated CIA scenes seem a bit unnecessary.Unfortunately, the relationships that Robert has built up with the various inhabitants of Altamore are not all equally strong. As a result, some of these relationships and characters may interest you a little less during the film. Fortunately, Denzel Washington plays the role of the Equalizer well and charismatically, but like the character he is more elderly and recovering.They also show nicely the Italian environments and culture. Many Italian characters are therefore played more by Italian actors, who also continue to speak more Italian.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","loreloren","10 September 2023","Always liked the idea of Denzel kicking arse and using a stop watch,it's so original and the fact that he ends up knocking them dead is entertaining.This is my first movie to watch in a theater starred Denzel was truly something.Equalizer 3 isn't a fine piece of art and I think for that reason should be watched in a theater,other wise it might be boringBut that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy It. I personally enjoyed the unaware frighting scenes that came with the theater sound,It's nothing compared to a tv sound.And Denzel acting all helpless old man and later killing mercylessly is truly enjoying.But the villain of Equalizer 3 didn't bring any challenge to Denzel in fact no one lay a finger on him in the entire movie. The god mode wasn't effective cause the villain was a joke.Other than that it's not a bad movie but they could have done better.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","mitch-anthony","6 September 2023","I love Denzel but poor scriptwriting let him down and spoilt the movie. It was a disappointing end to a overall good trilogy. You have to suspend a certain amount of belief to think that ageing and wounded ex CIA assassin McCall can single handedly defeat the Sicilian Mafia. With that in mind I embarked on Equalizer 3. Yeah he's a trained killer, but c'mon. He takes out the crime family younger brother with relative ease, faces off with the older brother and is saved by the locals who intervene with harsh words and phone video (of course real mafioso would just kill him or kidnap him, as they had the police in their pocket!). Then McCall takes the initiative to covertly infiltrate the older brothers heavily guarded mansion. How you ask? Clever hacking of the security system? No, he lets off a car alarm and enters the mansion grounds after easily overpowering ONE guard. Next scene he's actually in the building and takes a few guards out with no real resistance. Poor, poor, lazy scriptwriting and sums up lazy $$$ sequels. I'll fondly remember Eq 1 & 2 but 3 only gets a 5/10 from me.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","martin_merelesc","14 October 2023","I liked it a lot!!! Since I can't stand injustice, it seems very good to me that someone defends good people. Each of his movies has been different for me, even though he has played the avenger in all of them. This one is not boring at all, as I have read in some reviews. Let's see it's not James Bond, nor Mission Impossible, it has some action, but the good thing about this movie is what Denzel does, his heart, his feelings...
Although sometimes it is too violent, but there are people who only understand violence. With this I don't want to justify it, but there are people so bad, so bad that they mess with the most vulnerable who deserve the worst. Another thing: do they speak Italian? But in what country have they seen it? In Spain there are subtitles every time they speak Italian, and even so I think it is perfectly understood. And Dakota Fanning is glad to see her older than in Thirst for Vengeance. Also, the place where the film takes place, ""beautiful"" and makes you really want to visit it, with or without a fight included. Too bad it's the last one in the Saga.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","alindsayal","7 September 2023","I have enjoyed the previous Equalizer films and finally we have a third film in this franchise and possibly the final film of the trilogy and here is my review for The Equalizer 3. The premise of the film sees McCall end up in Southern Italy where he becomes a part of the community, it ends up this community is run by the mafia which springs him into action.Main Character
Denzel Washington once again reprises his role as Robert McCall and he is fantastic. I feel like there are few true movie stars left and Denzel is one of them and oozes charisma in this role. He is believable in both the nice guy and as this menacing killing machine. This film is truly elevated by the performance of Denzel Washington and I am glad he agreed to do this film.Supporting Characters
Dakota Fanning plays a CIA agent and she is good in the role, she has good chemistry with Washington and it is nice to once again see her acting. Her role and character aren't particularly interesting but Fanning is good here.The rest of the cast suffer a bit though, everyone just feels incredibly generic with no character. All the people, protagonists and antagonists in Italy are by the numbers and they offer very little to this film, though everyone is really trying their best.Story
The story is okay, I do like the story that involves the development of Robert McCall and it is always fun seeing Denzel Washington taking down bad guys in the pursuit of justice. It is just a bit like we go through the motions here and don't get much that is new here. Plus they have a story involving terrorists and it brings Dakota Fanning's character into the film and it doesn't need to be here, it doesn't really affect the film and I wonder what the whole point of it was.Script
The script is functional, there are some alright dramatic scenes and humour, though I think it was raised by Denzel Washington's performance. There isn't much meat here and it dulls it down to your pretty generic action film.Style
This film is easily the most violent of the trilogy and when the action is taking place it is very cool and seeing Washington take down these mobsters is very fun. But the pacing of the film is a bit all over the place, after the first action sequence there is a big lull and it really took me out of the film.Overall
Overall, The Equalizer 3 is an above average film. It is one of those generic action films that works well for the fans of the franchise but isn't one that you need to rush out and see.Rating - 6/10.","9/10"
"The Equalizer 3","liav1609","6 November 2023","The first 2 movies PACKED action scenes, and this one had barely 2-3 of them...
I don't know why and who decided that this is a good idea to cut the MAIN idea of The Equalizer - ACTION SCENES! But it definitely ruined most the movie (pretty sure not only for me as I can see lots of comments with these complains).Also BTW with the ending being too soft for my opinion, even my girlfriend asked where is the action from the 1+2 movies and that the movie bored her a little too.The story is good, finally we can see him gets his rest and the quiet he was looking for.And because of the story - Im giving it 6-7, if more action scenes were made in this movie it was easily a 8 stars.I love Denzel by the way.","8/10"
"The Equalizer 3","rahulramanuj","9 September 2023","As much as I really wanted to enjoy the latest Denzel Washington blockbuster I was left with an underwhelming feeling on the whole.He was absolutely fantastic as usual, delivered brutal blows when needed and gave a slightly softer feel to the film. Where I feel it lacked were the other characters and also the storyline was too good to be true. The dialogue was decent and scenery was beautiful throughout in Sicily. Maybe I expected too much but it was nowhere near as good as the Equaliser 1 and in general films 9-10 years ago were a lot better than they are now. I'd give it a solid 6/10 but it was nothing special. Denzel was breathtaking as always though. ü§òüèΩüëåüèº","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","timitimitimi-9-302238","9 October 2023","Alright, here's my take on ""Equalizer 3"":Equalizer 3 is a film that, quite frankly, misses the mark on multiple fronts. While it aims to be a high-octane action thriller, it ends up being a lackluster installment that neither thrills nor engages the audience. Denzel Washington returns as Robert McCall, but even his stellar acting can't save this sinking ship.The script is riddled with clich√©s and predictable plot points, making it feel like a recycled version of its predecessors. There's a palpable absence of tension or stakes, and the characters feel one-dimensional. It's as if the filmmakers took the formula that worked in the first two films and diluted it to the point of irrelevance.The action sequences, which should be the film's highlight, are marred by shoddy choreography and uninspiring cinematography. Gone is the slick, visceral feel of the original, replaced by disjointed set pieces that seem to have been thrown together last minute.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the lack of character development. McCall remains largely the same from start to finish, making the entire ordeal feel pointless. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, serving as mere pawns in a poorly executed game.In summary, Equalizer 3 is a disappointing addition to what could have been a compelling franchise. It feels like a cash grab that disrespects not only its audience but also the legacy of the films that came before it. If you're looking for an action-packed, emotionally engaging thriller, I'd suggest skipping this one and revisiting the original.So yeah, not a fan. Would not recommend.","2/10"
"The Equalizer 3","tresm87","31 August 2023","2014 was a massive year for the action genre. 2 films that people really didn't see coming reignited a somewhat dormant and overdone genre. John Wick and then The Equalizer. These powerhouse hits full of classic action and legendary Iconic performances by well established actors brought the genre back to near 90s action levels. Near a decade later both franchises are still going strong.The Equalizer 3 brings all the ballistics and escapades Denzel has dabbled in and maybe even more this time around. The changes are more within the new settings than anything and that could be for the worse imo. Not saying the visuals aren't astounding, but the plotting changes because of the exotic locations may have watered down the story overall. We have seen enough mafia themed films to where it can cheapen the product at this point.Aside from that nitpick, it's still a very serviceable and exciting sequel with another great performance by the legend himself. Definitely doesn't break new ground like the first film, but it offers another chapter in the equalizer story.","2/10"
"The Equalizer 3","richzytko","18 December 2023","Denzel is the man. The third installment did not leave you unfulfilled. Set in beautify Italy, who didn't want to instantly be transformed there. And the hospitality and charm and the melodic language - I'm selling my house in NJ and moving there!What a shame that la familia is in Sicily! Who would have thought.Robert McCall still kicking. Those stairs! My knee hurts just thinking of it. While convalescing he sees a shake down that rapidly escalates into a one-man war. Every local is intimidated and compromised yet gathers around their new friend. Lots of graphic bloody broken bone scenes, glass shards to the face - he made his point.

"The Equalizer 3","whitetowel-74786","4 October 2023","I don't usually bother with money spinning third instalments but hey, movie pickings are slim and it's Denzel and Dakota reuniting some 20 years after the excellent 'Man on Fire'. Wish i hadn't bothered tbh, this Equalizer bookend mostly fires blanks.Of course Denzel is as brilliant as ever in the starring role, the all-Italian scenery is stunning and the (albeit) few and far between action scenes are well executed (and graphic), but that's about all. The story itself is slow, talky and lacking in genuine thrills, spills and intensity. The screenplay is cliched, uneventful and wholly predictable (Italy>crime>mafia>retribution - yawn) but most annoying is that literally half the film is in subtitled Italian dialogue, which is way ott and detracts from the overall viewing experience. I found myself fast forwarding after a while as the lacklustre proceedings dragged on like an extended audience with the Pope.Yep, all in all it's a disappointing one-watch end to the trilogy that's for completists and Denzel afficinados only. Back to the three Godfather classics it is then... Arrivederci Mr Washington.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","djrmc24","21 November 2023","The Equalizer 3 is one of those rare sequels that is actually better then the original. The story is strong in this 3rd outting. Denzel is better then ever and kicks total butt in this film. This movie see's our main hero trying to lead a quiet life in a small town in Italy but things start to turn south when local thugs disrupt that peaceful life. I think this movie works so well because it prioritizes the story over mindless action. Speaking of the action it is in your face and very brutal. The beginning of the film reminded me something that we see in a horror film with the carnage that is laid out. You can tell that Denzel really enjoys playing this part and has great chemistry with the Director. The Equalizer 3 is a really solid film and not just an action film but a film with a lot of heart at it's core. The Equalizer 3 gets a high 8 stars out of 10 from me. The best of the Equalizer movie series.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","PANDIAN120621","4 October 2023","Denzel is Undoubtedly the one of the greatest male actors of our generation gives a rich layered,charismatic & captivating performance without being too formulaic...
The action sequences are well choreographed with a touch of morbid and the opening sequence was innovative and the memorable one...but denzel slays the entire mafia with no challenge to his skills as there is no formidable enemy was a big drawback...
Onthe otherhand a one man army taking on a mob plot was well handled by director with sensible screenplay and camera by robert richardson captures the coastal Italy(Altmonte) is soothing enough to elevate the movie...
The conversation between doctor & denzel about good and bad man is a memorable dialogue that holds the soul of the movie...

"The Equalizer 3","mka-net","8 October 2023","This movie was just as good as the first two Equalizer movies. It reminds me of the way action movies used to be before Hollywood switched to cringe all-women-power movies that nobody wants to watch.I'm not going to spoil much. Just note that the movie is action-packed from beginning to end. Instead of focusing on artificially inserting progressive political talking points and too much CGI, it focuses on just making a great action movie.I kind of makes me a little sad that Denzel Washington is one of the last reminding great actors from the 90's movies. I'm hoping that Hollywood will go back to making great action movies like this again.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Movie_Beta","17 November 2023","I must admit, I really enjoy Denzel Washington movies and these Equaliser movies in particular. There is something satisfying seeing a pretty average looking guy standing up with vigilante justice for the little guy.Before starting this movie, a quick glance at the runtime shows it is the shortest of the trilogy at well under 2hrs runtime, which was not necessarily a negative, as modern cinema too often seems to go for 'bigger is better' mentality. That being said, we do lose some depth in this third part of the trilogy. There is no getting to know the characters of the village and their back stories and motivation. It's all very superficial.The movie does kind of break the normal sequence of things as the first scenes throw is right in at the deep end within moments of the start, and which in fact could have been the 'end' of another movie. The locations and scenery are wonderful and we get the feel of an old Sicilian village. Though as said previously, the pace just moves too fast for the viewer to appreciate and understand the setting and it's inhabitants.Action wise we get more than expected, with some really gory deaths, and a high body count for the bad guys. The final confrontation comes about too quickly really and has some Scarface influence in the extravagantly decorated mafia villa. The final scenes throws in one last twist and ties up this series nicely and ends it on a high. Enjoyable action thriller.8/10.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","ccarriere-43044","7 September 2023","That type of actions movie...the scenes are predictable so it is important to offer sometimes like in this case ...a black/white world ...where the villain are really bad & the rest are good even innocent...lots of blood ...but mostly after the kill the rhythm is good, the movie is actualy short 94 minutes. Denzel Washington is very good in this role, he succed in giving his character a redemption qualities. This film allow you to visit the mostly beautiful scenery...in southern Italy ...the only scene not so believable is the end in Naples...but only if you have been there ... I enjoyed myself.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","mattpberinger","29 November 2023","As a fan of the first 2 movies, I eagerly anticipated a sequel that could deliver action and excitement while delving into the intricate world of the Italian mafia. Unfortunately, this movie falls dramatically short of expectations, robbing the viewers of any suspense or surprise, and turning the story into a tedious, uninspiring slog.Denzel takes a vacation in Italy, drinks tea most of the time, shoots some mobsters for a few flashing minutes. Yes these brief shooting scenes are gory, yes they are cool. Wow what a compelling plot.No building action, no originality whatsoever. For most of the time he walks in old and dark alleys, and drinks tea while talking with totally shallow characters with a narrative so uneventful that it barely registers. The relentless gloom and doom, and the predictability of the actions leave the viewer feeling drained rather than engaged or entertained.Another major drawback is the over-reliance on Italian language and English subtitles. While I understand and appreciate the desire for authenticity in language, the execution here is cumbersome. The subtitles dominate most of the screen time, often distracting from the visual storytelling. This constant back-and-forth between reading and viewing disrupts the cinematic experience, making it hard to immerse oneself in the film's world.The cinematography, though potentially a redeeming feature here, only adds to the film's woes. The director's choice to shroud every scene in darkness might have been intended to create a moody atmosphere, but it instead results in a visually monotonous and overwhelmingly depressing experience.While I like the actor, this movie is a disappointing addition to the mafia genre, and it's definitely not on my re-watch list.","4/10"
"The Equalizer 3","muratnico-34913","29 October 2023","I try not to look at the rating before I watch a film as it either raises expectations or spoils a good film, after watching this film out of curiosity I thought I'd check and see what it got , expecting 5 at most, my god the IQ rate of the world must be shrinking every year, who would rate this 7-8-9??? Apart from Denzel and Dakota the acting is 3rd class , some scenes you would expect to see in a cheap video film. In my opinion platforms like n.flix, pr.me....etc are ruining the cinema trade for everyone. Equalizer 3 is a forgettable and unnecessary film. The plot is predictable, The only thing that saves the film from being a complete disaster is Denzel Washington's performance, However, even he can't save this film.","5/10"

And now he's got to deal with that.And here I thought that Robert was going to take the entire organisation head on.But no, he had help and he just took care of the locals, mafia style. Stabbing and choking and all sorts of torture methods.Speaking of which, I couldn't help but feel that the blatant references to the godfather movies were out of place, even if the events happen in Sicily.I mean as I mentioned, the stabbing and choking with a wire, the alternation between a death and a celebration scene, the traditional pasta meal, down to what looks like the beheaded horse in the bed scene!Too much really.But, in the end, it was a fairly entertaining movie, well executed I might say, for what it is.

"The Equalizer 3","Padi_2704","9 September 2023","""The Equalizer 3"" may have guaranteed an extreme activity pressed insight, yet it left me with blended sentiments. Even though it had its good points, there were parts of the movie that made me want more.First of all, the level of violence in some scenes surprised me. It is essential to note that this franchise has never shied away from violence; however, there have been times when it has felt excessive and gratuitous, which has hampered the viewing experience as a whole.The plot of the film, while fascinating in parts, didn't necessarily in every case draw an obvious conclusion durably. There were times when the narrative appeared to veer off course or introduced subplots that did not fully support the main plot. I was left with unanswered questions and the impression of missed storytelling opportunities as a result of this occasional lack of coherence.Surprisingly, ""The Equalizer 3"" also lacked the high-octane action scenes that series fans have come to expect. Given the establishment's standing for its extraordinary and innovative activity, this felt like a botched an open door to convey the energy that watchers expected.Finally, the peak of the film left me fairly unsatisfied. The simplicity with which Denzel Washington defeated the primary bad guy felt excessively great. It lacked the struggle and tension that typically distinguish such confrontations. A seriously difficult and sincerely charged standoff might have raised the film's general effect.Eventually, ""The Equalizer 3"" had its minutes, a brilliant cast, beautiful shots, Denzel Washington in the main role is really good, great acting and enthusiasts of the series might in any case track down angles to appreciate. Notwithstanding, the film's unnecessary ruthlessness, periodic story irregularities, a deficiency of activity, and a disappointing finale might leave a few watchers feeling that it missed the mark concerning its true capacity.","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","therealjaysmoke","7 October 2023","The Equalizer 1 was amazing, the 2 was wack, so I was hopeful and skeptical going into this one but my my my, 2hrs went by in a flash! Denzel Washington embodies this role perfectly. His demeanor, his facial expressions, his mannerisms. He is the exact fit for this role, I find myself wondering what watching a young Denzel (Training Day) play this role would be like.Now to the actual movie, I loved the start, the suspense was great and I liked how it came back full circle at the end with similar fight scenes. Speaking of which, the fight scenes were spot on and took me right back to the first movie. However, it was just too little and easy. I wish they had created more. Come to think of it, I think there were only 3 fight scenes in the entire movie. That sucks..It was great seeing Dakota back on the screens alongside Denzel. I think the script was too simple, which was a let down, considering the type of actor Denzel is. But it didn't really matter much because the cinematography was spot on. I just couldn't get my eyes off the screen the whole time. I seriously wouldn't mind watching this a couple more times.","5/10"

I just hope that he and Denzel in the future will have other projects together. Because I understand that this is the final.film series to the Equalizer series.

I thought some of the scenery shot's were beautiful. I love the fact that the movie showed the battle of guilt and shame for enjoying the monster he can be, while simultaneously keeping moments when he can be relaxed and cool. For me I did wish the movie was longer to be the finisher I wanted to see him go all out like the other's. It felt short to me.","5/10"
"The Equalizer 3","JICNZ","1 November 2023","I genuinely cannot fault this film. Not only is it trademark Equalizer, it's set in the most gorgeous Italian village, which lends the whole atmosphere an effective religious backdrop. The deep faith, kindness and joy of the local people gives an extra heart to this third in the franchise. The plot is 'Equalizer' formulaic, fortunately, because it's what we come to the series to see: Denzil reluctantly takes on some bad guys and it doesn't end well for them.This one is a delightfully slow build, from an explosive and slightly confusing start. About five minutes in I was wondering if I'd come into the film halfway through. Fear not, all is revealed.I cannot recommend this film too highly. It's absolutely perfect entertainment. It's got heart, beauty, grace, and courage. And lots of violence, gore and well-earned retribution for evil-doers. What more could anyone want?","3/10"

"The Equalizer 3","KFstudios2009","20 September 2023","The Equalizer 3 is the weakest chapter in The Equalizer franchsie. I enjoyed this movie a bit, but I have to admit, this was like a simple remake. The same things that happened in the previous movies, happens the same in this one. He kill some people, the other got mad, they try to kill him and he tries to kill them. The same things happen in every movie, and in the first one, it worked, but the two last ones, didn't work, unfortunately. Denzel Washington is once again back as the secret character Robert (or Roberto), that search for peace. The movie started like if something new is going to happen, but no. Just the same stuff. New mafia, new location, the good things about this Equalizer was the filming locations and camera-work, nice pictures, and they introduced Robert's new friends good and I could understand that Robert have found peace in Italy. The action sequences was weak, they could have more fighting and less just killing. This movie didn't do a good job about that. And really, if they didn't wrote ""The Final Chapter"" I would never thought that this was the final chapter, as this is the grand finaly, I expected something extrarordinary, since this is the end. Could end more complete and they could do something that I really could think that this was the end. But it ended the same way, all of the Equalizer movies are build up in the same freaking way. That is annoying, because you know when everything is going to happen. Robert was once again the not so known character, you don't know who he really is, and since this is the finale, I would like to know some more about this character, but in the end, The Equalizer trilogy is closed, and we might never find out who Robert really is, and who he was after all. So, to summary, The Equalizer 3: The Final Chapter, was the weakest chapter, many uncomplete elements, and I expected something way better. For fans of action and suspense, this might be a good one, but it was a little boring, too. I really want to like this movie but unfortunately, this wasn't the best. Fifty-fifty, in the middle.","7/10"

"The Equalizer 3","nightringer-76840","5 October 2023","Now this is what The Equalizer is about. A retired assassin solving refular people's problem because the perpetrators are powerful devourers of others.The beauty pf Fuqua's vision of Robert McCall stays the same with the trilogy. Denzel successfully took over and embodied what the modern day The Equalizer looks, acts, and specific style of problem solving. He is silent, swift, well timed and deadly. He comes and leaves without any warning nor sound, while bad guys' bodies are scattered all over the place.Equalizer 3 has a very different cinematic approach that wrapped The Equalizer Trilogy. The assassination were done without any fancy dance nor violence, but swift and direct deadly hit that ended the life of the bad guys. It was a masterpiece art of death.Denzel looks is at the right age of Retirement, making this 3rd installment easy to digest. And RM principle of not wasting unnecessary life, almoat killed him in the process, which he gladly took as part of the necessary progress of his action.However, that became his blessing coz he found a place to call home and a partner to equalize his mission for the future in the reunion with Dakota Fanning.Don't sleep on it, The Equalize 3 is a must see.","7/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Lord-Voltemort","10 January 2024","First 5 mins were good. They should have stayed with that story line or even made that the end scene and told the story leading up to it. But they didnt and the opening scene becomes a way for them to basically bring the CIA into the movie and cast Dakota Fanning prob for some Denzel plus Dakota reunion marketing. She really serves no purpose for the actual plot. The real ""Big Bad"" ends up being The Camorra mafia and he fights them because they shake down this town that he's become partial too. Ok fine, if that's your super simple revenge story plot, great. None of us are gonna care that much about it but we're here for the ass kicking. So you gotta pack your story with ass kicking to make up for the lack of interesting story. This does neither. No action happens for about an hour. The bulk of the film. If you're going to make his adversaries incompetent idiots that he goes through like butter, there must be a lot of them. Like 50-100 of them like in most John Wicks. And don't build up a bad guy as being some super bad ass mean guys that are a threat to be reconned with only to have this 70 year old man go through them all in 5 mins without breaking a sweat and not in any sort of interesting way. I gave it a 5 because Denzel is cool. Otherwise, it's a 2-3 because this should be the easiest movie to pull off. Its super low hanging fruit. When in doubt, make it kick ass and bare minimum it's a 6.5.","8/10"

"The Equalizer 3","cosby_don","9 January 2024","Honestly ... I left out of the theatre (my living room) feeling inspired to visit Italy and adding red wine to my list of things to do for my mental health in 2024. Seriously, the wine just looked so good in that scene where the townspeople were watching a movie on one of the buildings.I also left feeling that that town was POPPING. Sure it was peaceful but there are beautiful, friendly women and waitresses just walking around and sparking up conversations with strangers (who wouldn't want to live somewhere like that!), fireworks, soccer teams winning and celebrations, religious nights with candles, friendly doctors that provide help to anyone 24/7... I mean I could go on and on. Does this type of place actually exist? And do I mention as a Black man myself that no one called Denzel a slur in the whole movie? Even the bad guys... That's it! I'm packing my bags!As for the story-meh, very cliche. The bad guy? Meh, not scary and cried like a school girl at the end. Oh, and the female CIA agent-I'm sorry but her acting was atrocious. She was not believable in that role at all unfortunately. And the violence? Very gratuitous, but nothing I haven't scene before in a movie. It wasn't shot differently or creative, ya know?I did like the pace of the movie. It felt like an actual movie movie, like in the old days, aka 90's. But the story deserves better.","9/10"

Its slow, it meanders, just like Denzel taking the stairs.Majority of the characters are simply 'yes men' or part of the 'Denzel cult', cant outshine the aging star in this one.Atleast the new Indiana jones film although horrible, wasnt so full of itself like this movie is, just avoid completely.","3/10"
"The Equalizer 3","gilleliath","18 February 2024","You can see a mile off that this was made with Italian film grants: it's set in this fantasy Italy, superbly picturesque, in which everything is relaxed and everybody is super-nice and nurturing - except the bad guys, of course. You know, everything that kinda reminds you of what really matters in life. Just the place for your next hols. Less understandably, since there is no obvious link to Australia, it got Australian money too (presumably they had some Australian crew).Like Liam Neasden with his 'certain set of skills', Denzel Washington has established his action persona with a success that would have seemed unlikely earlier in his career; but here he only gets a few fun moments with it, and the finale is decidedly underwhelming. I was convinced there must be another scene to come, but no. Compared to the other two it lacks impact. If, as he says, he is happy for this to be the last of the series, it suggests that he doesn't take its legacy terribly seriously.On the plus side, it's a welcome surprise to see Catholic imagery play so big a part in a film, positively, without any sense of irony or any attempt to exploit it sensationally. I'm only a little disappointed that we didn't at some point get to see McColl reading the Summa Theologiae in Latin or something. He's so brainy, you know!","10/10"
"The Equalizer 3","Lewis_Heather787","4 November 2023","Well I certainly wasn't expecting this! I'll be honest I was really not bothered or that enthusiastic to watch the third instalment in the ""Equalizer"" franchise. The first two films for me where average/ok at best and to be honest I have completely forgotten about them. So going into this one, I wasn't expecting much.Wow am I glad that I gave it a chance because this is easily the best instalment in the trilogy, by a long way. I believe there are 3 reasons why this succeeds over the other 2 films. They are tone, location and story. All of those 3 elements are massively improved upon and elevate this film, plus keep it a more interesting/compelling watch. The tone is so much more grounded and darker in this film than the previous and it suits the main character and story so much better. Not saying the other films are light hearted comedies, no but this one certainly feels more grittier. Its also helped by using Italy as the main location of the film, its a gorgeous country and it pairs beautifully together with the thriller genre. Lastly, story. This story is much more interesting and grandiose than the others whilst still remaining serious and not caricature in any way. I loved the vibe the whole through and the story has a nice completion to it as well that doesn't feel forced.Even though I really enjoyed the film, is it a masterpiece? No. Is it going to break any boundaries within film or the genre? Also no. However, its just a really solid film to watch that is good. Nothing wrong film a film just being good, maybe thats its maximum potential. 70% out of 100.","4/10"

The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies.

"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024","By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024","I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)","3/10"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024","Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse.","3/10"
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024","After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024","I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful.","4/10"
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024","Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required.","3/10"
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024","Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor.","3/10"
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024","David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024","A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024","The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism.","2/10"
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024","I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time..","3/10"

"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024","Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day.","2/10"

The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees.

"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024","The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter.","4/10"
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024","The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024","I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!","9/10"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024","When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun.","5/10"
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate.","6/10"

One day a friend of his is taken by scammers, he vows to take revenge.Once again, I find myself thoroughly entertained and very satisfied by one of Jason Statham's high octane, action films.It's way over the top, and some of the dialogue is beyond abysmal, so corny, but the core essence is rather emotive, who hasn't been annoyed recently, hearing of some elderly person being scammed out of their life savings.Some of the talk about bees is honestly cringe worthy, but that's the charm of the film, it's not trying to take itself too seriously.Lots of great action scenes, very well staged, and Statham is just so cool.On the debit side, Agent Parker isn't a particularly good character, and some of the American accents are a little dodgy, Jemma Redgrave's in particular is a little dodgy.I really did enjoy it.7/10.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024","The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive.

"The Beekeeper","RightOnDaddio","13 January 2024","There is so much to like about this movie.It's got Minnie Driver in it. She's been driving a path to my heart for, yikes, thirty years now.Josh Hutcherson is a villain. And a darn good one.He's likable, funny, stupid and despicable all at once and it is lovely to see.He takes full advantage of his role and the audience in full reaps the benefits.This movie has cinematic testosterone with a capital T squeezed right from the glorious 1980's and butt-kicking with a capital B.They pair together rather nicely as they often do.The kills are plenty and plenty creative.Director David Ayer doing what he always does best.And Jeremy Irons stepping in and classing up the joint.This is a most welcome original theatrical release for January.It's not a comic book movie or a Star Wars movie.It's not a reboot, sequel or prequel.It's Jason Statham doing Jason Statham things.And it is a blast to watch on the big screen.I also highly recommend another Beekeeper film, Ulee's Gold (1997) starring Peter Fonda. It too, is quite buzz worthy.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","Bateman_Reviews","12 January 2024","I was going into this with little to no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that everything in this movie was so satisfying. I felt 0 sympathy for any of the villains or scammers in this movie and it was euphoric to see them get their due reckoning. Of course Jason nails it and makes ever kill and brutal take down very satisfyingOne thing I will say is that the lore behind the Bee Keepers was interesting enough to keep my attention though corny with the hive talk at times it works as world building. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of action movies and likes satisfying conclusions.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","nscoby93","16 January 2024","This will be quick... everything about this film is hilariously bad. The script is bad, the writing is bad, and the dialogue is bad. It was so bad that I couldn't help but feel it was parody of itself because of how serious they took this subject matter.The premise is so laughable in its stupidity. If it wasn't for Statham and the surprisingly amazing action sequences, choreography, and great sound effects, this film would've been a complete waste of time.Jason Statham plays the Beekeeper who is essentially Jason Bourne, John Wick, and Agent 47 levels of badass. Jason Statham, to his credit, makes this whole Beekeeper ""society"" work as he is a sort of agent outside the government that protects society. He is retired now but is forced out to write a wrong against someone who cared for him. At it's core this film is nothing more than a paint by numbers action revenge movie. Unfortunately, it does it all in the most horrendous of ways.Then, if the story wasn't already horrible enough, the ending left my friend and I laughing. It literally, and I am not exaggerating here, just ends the cut to credits is the most erupt ending I've seen in a movie. If this ending is supposed to be set up to a possible sequel, I say NO!This year is not starting so well, but it is only January. This is commonly the slow time when it comes to movie releases. So if you are desperate enough and I mean desperate then maybe you can garner some entertainment from The Beekeeper but expect nothing from the story or characters turn your brain off enjoy your popcorn, your beverage, and good action.IMDb: 3/10

"The Beekeeper","dave-1205","12 January 2024","The film's narrative hinges on outlandish scenarios and unbelievable action, often veering into unintentionally humorous territory due to its sheer absurdity of specific sequences.While films, even those with mature content, can offer immersive experiences, 'The Beekeeper' falls short. Its graphic elements ('18' UK, 'R' US) juxtaposed with its stretched plot create a tonal disconnect that alienates its intended audience, leaving viewers unable to suspend disbelief.While the film delivers the genre's requisite action sequences, the plot struggles to maintain credibility, often indulging in exaggerated scenarios that feel more amateurish than polishedStepping out of a well-crafted movie is like emerging from a captivating dream, your mind buzzing with the story's echoes. Sadly, ""The Beekeeper"" left me thoroughly indifferent.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","leftbanker-1","1 February 2024","Some call this a John Wick rip-off, but it isn't any stupider or make any less sense than that absurd franchise of mindless killing. I just kept hearing the Itchy and Scratchy theme song throughout this kill-fest: they fight and bite, they fight and bite and fight. Fight, fight, fight, bite, bite, bite, The Beekeeper. And were all the people in this unit also bee helpers? What if one of them wanted to have an ant farm? Would that be OK?Seriously, how old should you be before you grow out of these ridiculous combat movies where one man takes on an army? 12? 13 tops. If there is no possibility of a bullet or even a fist striking the hero, then all of the action is devoid of tension. If there is no tension, just fast-forward to the end credits and save yourself a lot of time. The Equalizer, John Wick, and the films of Jason Statham are not entertainment fit for adults.There were some horrific performances and huge casting gaffs in this. Jeremy Irons simply cannot do an American accent. Period. He sounded like he had a speech impediment. The FBI woman was morbidly obese, yet wore a Harvard Track & Field t-shirt. Was that supposed to be ironic?The movie shows why no one should have a gun in their home. More folks die from their own hands than intruders.","1/10"

"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024","In the latest Jason Statham venture, 'The Beekeeper,' the film takes an audacious swing at action but ends up missing the mark by a wide margin. The acting is staggeringly subpar, setting Statham on an unintended pedestal that makes him seem Oscar-worthy by comparison. It's as if the casting was deliberately skewed to elevate his performance through the mere juxtaposition of talent-or the lack thereof. The action sequences limp along without the slightest hint of vigor or excitement, the anticipated gore is conspicuously absent, leaving much to be desired for fans of the genre. The punches, both literal and metaphorical, lack any semblance of impact, making each fight scene feel more like a choreographed middle -school dance than a battle. To add insult to injury, the dialogue is so laughably inept that it unwittingly becomes the only source of entertainment, albeit for all the wrong reasons. Leaving audiences wondering what could have been if it had managed to harness even a fraction of its star's renowned kinetic energy.","3/10"
"The Beekeeper","cruise01","13 January 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars.The Beekeeper is a pretty good action thriller film that puts Jason Statham back in a action role and at what he does best. This might as well be his version of a John Wick franchise.The plot is following a beekeeper (Jason Statham) after the lady he has been helping dies after being scammed and stolen from everything. He decides to go on the hunt for those that are responsible. Which leads into something more than he expects.Awesome plot which he follows a certain set of guidelines until the system is broken is were he steps in and at full force to stop the threats. The action sequences are awesome. Jason Statham was great. The rest of cast ensemble is good too. David Ayers direction is full of fast paced and action that makes this film worth seeing on the big screen. Sure the dialogue can be a little repetitive with characters explaining a beekeeper and how they are meant to protect the hive which sure is explaining it to the audience of who this character is.Overall, it is one of the most entertaining action films from Jason Statham since the first Transporter films.","9/10"

And it all goes to the script. Like this must have been a rough, ROUGH first draft and left to just go to production. In short, I am certain there will be a sequel, but OMG I hope not.

"The Beekeeper","siderite","30 January 2024","I am going to fail this film as being as close to predictable as humanly possible, and still bad. Statham is the new Chuck Norris. He beats everybody up, kills the wicked and stares down the worthy. He is always fast, but compared only to the really slow opponents he has to face. He is always smart, but only compared to the morons stacked up against him. But he's entertaining, unless the story sucks.And boy, does it suck here. Almost every idea put forth is ridiculous and then completely contradicted just a few minutes later. The editing is bad, there is no one even resembling having fun, except maybe Bobby Naderi. It's 100% by the numbers, a movie scam.The FBI characters are completely pointless. The Black female agent is there for quota purposes only, as she starts off as incompetent, rude and cocky and she continues to run things on the basis of her arrogance alone, thus invalidating the entire premise of the film! Or maybe justifying it, I don't know. Jeremy Irons looks the same for decades, I don't know how he does it, but in this film even his character is reluctantly doing his job, reduced from a powerful man to an acting puppet in bad situations. Minnie Driver is in this. She answers phones. That's all she does for like three scenes.Bottom line: Hollywood should have Beekeepers. The only interesting aspect of this movie is that its production seems to parallel almost exactly the plot of the film. Everything but the righteous ending.","5/10"
"The Beekeeper","academic-drifter","16 January 2024","The origin of this revenge fantasy isn't hard to imagine. My guess is that the writer (whose track record in recent years consists largely of writing scripts for completely unnecessary remakes of great action films) was persuaded to give money to a Nigerian prince or invest in NFTs, and decided to get payback by making them the villains of an action piece. Only having Jason Statham beat up a bunch of crypto bros seemed like an unequal contest, so he needed to up the stakes - with extreme prejudice.Thus we get a film in which a bunch of suspiciously well-organized scammers clean a sweet old lady (played by Mrs. Huxtable herself, so you know she's pure goodness) out of her life's savings. Unbeknownst to them, she rents out her barn to a beekeeper who decides to take revenge. Only he's not just a beekeeper, but a retired ""Beekeeper"", a former member of an ultra-secret elite extralegal organization created to maintain ""balance in the system"" by any means necessary, provided those means are violent ones. What could possibly be wrong with that?And with one phone call to his former employer, ex-Beekeeper Statham (his character has some typically generic name that is utterly unmemorable) gets needed information that federal law enforcement has been unable to obtain for years. And with it he begins to work his way up the chain to the very top, brushing aside with casual indifference challenges that would stymie anyone else. Armed thugs, SWAT teams, and ex-Special Forces operative are shrugged off with just a few moves. Injuries that would immobilize or even kill lesser people are mere annoyances to him, handled with a grunt and an application of a piece of cloth to some random part of his body. T-800s would envy such durability.More concerning is the recurring condition from which Beekeeper Statham has suffered that has caused him to internalize both his title and his pastime, to the point where every conversation with him degenerates into a series of beekeeping metaphors. Evidently this is a viral illness, as others he comes into contact with or who even learn of his existence soon spout the same inane analogies. With it comes a sort of resigned acceptance that all this murder and property destruction is necessary to protect ""the hive."" At this point Mrs. Huxtable has been forgotten five crimes scenes ago save by her daughter, who happens to be an FBI agent and who manages to figure out everything with the help of a beekeeping manual. Yes, it's like that.To be fair, if you like this sort of thing it's not the worst movie in the world. The ""system"" is saved, bad guys get their just desserts, and Beekeeper Statham lives to beekeep in the sequel (if any of this constitutes a spoiler to you, welcome to action films). The greatest crime on display in it, though, isn't the scamming or the murder or the property destruction, but the utter waste of acting talent, as several award-winning thespians are asked to do little more than deliver their lines on the way to cashing their checks. The only one who really threatens to run away with the movie is Josh Hutcherson, who plays a classier version of Donald Trump Junior with a degree of panache that threatens to make the movie fun. But then David Ayer's questionable camera angles and his need to showcase Statham's evident case of facial paralysis intervene to ensure that he does not prove to be the true hero of the movie by saving it from the tedium of predictability. But hey, at least scammers will think twice about scamming lest a Beekeeper gets them, right?","3/10"

Even Jeremy Irons goes like ""hey, wait.. why am I here?"".And then I have not even mentioned the supporting actors. If the supreme ones seem like they are sleepwalking, then the supporting ones are just like horribly bad. Worst of all is Emmy Raver-Lampman who absolutely cannot have passed any acting class whatsoever.It is all so tragic.

This is merciless vengeance and ass-kicking action on an extremely entertaining level.There are parallels to The Equalizer with Denzel Washington.

"The Beekeeper","rehmankhilji","4 February 2024","Upon encountering the name David Ayer as the director, alongside Jason Statham in a production bearing a promising title, I anticipated a satisfying full on action movie experience. However, akin to the recurrent pattern observed in Statham's previous films, this one, albeit marginally superior, failed to meet expectations.Initially, the director presents a character engaged in beekeeping, yet the portrayal lacks authenticity by sparing only a meager 100 bees and possessing a minimal number of hives, if not fewer than a dozen.The film's execution is notably deficient across numerous scenes, prompting a sense of incredulity and frustration. Numerous lapses in coherence and logic pervade the narrative, leaving the viewer bewildered and questioning the purpose of the cinematic endeavor.The prevalence of clumsy mistakes becomes evident within the initial minutes, rendering the movie entirely nonsensical in its unfolding. Emmy Raver-Lampman's casting in a particular role remains questionable, lacking a discernible rationale.In summation, refraining from viewing this production does not entail a significant loss, as it fails to deliver any substantial content of note.","3/10"

"The Beekeeper","kevin_robbins","19 February 2024","My wife and I recently caught The Beekeeper (2024) in theaters. The plot follows a retired special agent who tends to a bee colony and shares moments with his aging yet appreciative neighbor. However, when his neighbor falls victim to a scam, he unleashes hell in retaliation.Directed by David Ayer (Suicide Squad), the film features Jason Statham (Crank), Emmy Raver-Lampman (The Umbrella Academy), Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Jeremy Irons (Dead Ringers), and Phylicia Rashad (The Cosby Show).This movie is a chaotic mess. The acting and dialogue are horrendous and had a made-for-television vibe. It's a ""shut your brain off"" experience with over-the-top action scenes, some intentionally hilarious, and others so bad that they become amusing. The action choreography blends fights, knives, and gore brilliantly. The shootouts are fun. The bridge scene was excellent, ""unlucky"" conversation hilarious, the gas station sequence was wild and the brass knuckles fight cracked me up. There was some entertaining scene. Even Jeremy Irons seems awkward and out of place.In conclusion, The Beekeeper caters to action junkies. This has some John Wick, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme vibes.

And then, there are movies just make you feel bad. You feel bad because your intelligence rejects such an inferior product. This is a recent trend actually. I seriously don't know how they pick these actors and writers but they deliver the worst material thanks to horrible writing and cringy people. By the way, I'm an action fan and ""mindless action"" is great most of the time as long as it's done right. This is just a John Wick wannabe B movie diguised as an A class thanks to its budget (probably above the average).There is not much to say about Statham, he's doing some of his usual stuff again except he can't bend, jump or do his moves on the floor due to his age. As for the rest of the crew, that FBI lady is in the center of ""feel bad"". I mean useless nosey female law person is a cliche older than me already but her appearance, attitude and style couldn't be cringier than this, zero credibility. At least try to find some actor looks like a government agent for god sake. Her only contribution to the story is to help bringing more people to get wasted by Statham. As for Jeremy Irons, clearly he needed money, maybe that's understable at some extent. I won't even go into other cartoonish villains.

"The Beekeeper","alexcuetodo","4 February 2024","It's so basic trying to link the news with a plot so silly, that it's even funny; but nevertheless, this is a horrid film production. In align with that, it's worth mentioning limited acting, a terrible script and zero cinematographic intentions to make a good movie. Please keep Jason Statham away from the cameras for the upcoming years until he's retired unless he decides to compromise with his job. On the other hand, Jeremy Irons: shame on you for accepting being part of such a stupid story. I guess the writers were trying to create a mediocre copy of Jonh Wick, but without giving it too much thought. Finally, let's not allow that Emmy Raver-Lampman work in a film again, or, is the script to blame for her total unrealistic performance? This film has too many flaws to be depicted in a single review, but it was awful and a complete waste of time.","4/10"
"The Beekeeper","littlegomo","4 February 2024","Please could the script writer of this movie find another vocation, one very far away from script writing.This could have been a good movie, but the script is flat, dull and common. Actors get judged by their work but that is unfair if they are given rubbish to start with.I have seen actors ad lib better than this. Jeremy Irons is an academy award winning actor, I guess he also has to pay the rent but to sink to this level, he must be desperate.Jason Statham has had us in stitches when paired with a funny script and decent actors and his action sequences are a thing of beauty, but in this film his character is lifeless, almost zombie-like.This is such a terrible film, I gave up half way and decided to express myself here, which I rarely do.Please be warned, if you watch this film you will have wasted one hour and forty five minutes that you will never get back.I am only rambling on because some dimwit at I M D B decided to set a rule that all reviews must contain more than six hundred characters. That is the same level of intelligence that the script writer of this film has. People that dumb should not be able to breathe.","1/10"
"The Beekeeper","isaacsundaralingam","19 January 2024","David Ayer's 'The Beekeeper' might be good enough to make a convincingly fun trailer, but this Statham led action flick ends up being nothing more than a poorly written John Wick wannabe.Here we have Jason Statham playing Jason Statham as a beekeeper - an actual beekeeper but also a retired special agent part of an underground government program called (you guessed it) The Beekeepers. When his elderly neighbor, whom Statham repeatedly reminds us to be ""the only person who ever took care of (him)"", kills herself after losing her life savings in a phishing scam, he seeks revenge on her behalf, killing his way up the ladder of scammers towards whoever was responsible.'The Beekeeper' is written to be a very John Wick-esque action movie, with similar tropes and motivations, but with none of the smarts and the compelling that made the Wick movies so great. We have some bland characters spewing a bunch of off-the-script exposition at every opportunity, an underground system that's entirely uninteresting, some annoyingly corny bee trivia and worst of all, not a single satisfactory revenge moment. It's a revenge movie but the whole movie is just a repeated ""Wait, is that it?""... EVERY SINGLE REVENGE SCENE... ""Wait, is that it?""The action scenes were passable, sure, and the movie is definitely not boring, but at the end of the day, it's not worth your time. You might be inclined to say that it's just a mindless action movie and that I'm being a bit too harsh, and sure, maybe, but should I really not expect even the tiniest amount of logic and creativity in a movie that I'm supposed to be entertained by?","5/10"

The action is fantastic, it's well paced, directed and choreographed. Obviously it is very well portrayed as well.=CGI and Quality
Honestly this was the weakest department of the movie in the parts that are well done, some of the shots were very weird and the CGI explosions were not amazing for a movie production.=Acting
Nothing phenomenal but it does the job.=Characters
Very basic, but likeable characters throughout the film and the antagonists had their moments.","6/10"

Absolutely shameful from David Ayer and a who i dont care to search of a writer. A complete garbage film with their twist of unoriginality coupled with a weak story filled with copy n paste and cheesy actors they found on Skid Row.Disregarding the fact they couldn't come up with anything on their own. This film is riddled with bad scenes to corny lines that should have been on the chopping block or on B roll. But that shows you exactly what this production was about. Smoking weed, finding a script near the bottom of the pile, getting some semi big names and praying they make money.Hell, even the cameras they used were questionable.This film was hard to watch and if you're new to the movie scene (your very first movie) this might slip and be alright.

"The Beekeeper","Phil_M_A_Kerr","11 January 2024","I knew what I was walking into. Director David Ayer & writer Kurt Wimmer are no novices to the B+ action genre.John Wick has been taking up all the lone-killing-machine real estate of recent years. Where Wick leans into assassin/fantasy, Beekeeper does well to stay relevant. Turning on internet scams, dirty money, sketchy government officials, & family ties, it lays an acceptably current foundation. No, it's no Pulitzer, but heavyweights Statham, Rashad, Irons, Driver, Hutcherson, et al, & a competent supporting cast hit the right dramatic beats along the way. There's room for slightly better characterisation but one appreciates that the set armourer has priority over the acting coach in the high body count genre.My minor quibble is with the ""jello"" effect video cinema cameras suffer from. Not really suited to action films but when you're shooting fast and lean, who can afford the crispness of the film (celluloid) frame these days?","9/10"

At his age in the business, film offers don't grow on trees. This was a low-water mark with lousy acting. A movie, if you like Jason, that can be on in the background while you're doing something else. The cocain sniffing son who is the boss and the brain behind all scams goes to history in bad avrings.

Besides him, and one or two others, most of the actors seem to have been chosen in a box ticking exercise. The plot and acting is appalling, with the main emphasis on killing as many people as possible in a John Wick 3, type of movie. Having Potus as the head of the large criminal organisation The Beekeeper is trying to eradicate, has to be from someone with little respect of the real world or common sense and then, top it off, having the 20 year old son of Potus be the mastermind behind his mother's empire is mind boggling.

But you were wrong. This movie was written by all the rejects that weren't on strike apparently and I don't know how they wrote some of these lines and then said "" That's good, let's go to print. "". This could have been so cool. The best thing in this whole movie was the FBI partner of the garbage female lead. The cat from the Hunger Games did an okay job of making sure that you didn't like him so he probably wasn't bad either in hindsight.

Basically this one man goes through two branches of the federal law enforcement agencies without getting even a scratch. All law enforcement agencies behave like the keystone cops. Zero efforts were taken to write the smallest amount of realism into this script. I strongly believe Jeromy Irons can actually be scene laughing to him self during some of his ""serious scenes"" because he's going to fire his agent while at the same time thinking to himself ""I've done Shakespeare!"" The only positive aspects are the legitimate phishing scam used at the beginning (not the software) and the fight choreography which can be seen done much better in any of the John Wick films.

"The Beekeeper","wirednights","19 February 2024","With such a unique and eye-catching name as the Beekeeper, I was excited for this. I thought he'd use the bees to assassinate people, which would've been cooler than the actual movie premise. Then I started asking myself why I'm not watching John Wick instead. Staham in a raspy voice: ""Sometimes when there's dysfunction in the hive, you have to take out the queen"" lol ok. Is this the product of the writers strike? It would've been more believable if the call center was in India, not Massachusetts. But realism would upset someone. Beekeepers are a rip-off of Treadstone from the Jason Bourne series. The CGI office building explosion left me depressed. My conflusion: If you want real explosions, watch a real movie.They send a female beekeeper to take out Statham.. you probably forgot about her because she's dead in 30 seconds. Very anticlimactic and utterly pointless waste of runtime. The cringey Scottish guy at the end looks like a bad guy from Streets of Rage on Sega Genesis. Who writes this garbage? I can't believe Miramax put their name on this. This was worse than Thanksgiving 2023. I can enjoy brainless action movies, but this just did not work. Agent Verona Parker's character is so eye-rolling and unlikeable. She just sucked and was not believable as an FBI agent. Statham looks tired, he's less of a character in this movie and more of a plot device. Statham needs to retire, I'm not taking the bait again. He was good in Transporter 1 and The Mechanic, and that's all.","2/10"

Some of the Navy Seals put up more of a Fight than her(Not really, but you get what I mean)1c. üêù The Queen Bee Concept. So when the Queen Bee becomes Less Productive or Sick, the Worker Bees Kill her right? So why did the Filmakers Abandon this right at the Very end when Jason Statham is Staring at the Queen? Hello! He's called the Beekeeper and he doesn't even Follow through on the Concept? Ok so the Writers had no Balls to pull off the Kill? What about the Writers at Least Playing on this Angle At the Very End far more? Have Jason Statham take hold of that Revolver and having the Son and Queen There Playing Russian Roulette with the Revolver or Something.

Lets ignore that its an Australian movie, but considering some of the cast, the money on offer must have been good and included a free holiday on the Gold Coast.Storyline is about as original as a loaf of bread, the script lines were obviously limited to a small number of letters because it lacked a quality barely above a kids show, and the guys Statham had to fight were nothing more than statues awaiting to be hit.If you're a Statham worshipper, bored or low in IQ, its watchable, but be aware, you were warned.","1/10"

The action presented in the movie does steal the show, although some viewers may wish for more suspense and violence (gory/bloodier) than what is shown.In terms of plot, some viewers may feel that the main character Clay (played by Jason Statham) is often lucky.

There is also a sense that the movie has a bigger universe ... if this is successful I do believe that we can and will see a lot more of Statham and others.

"The Beekeeper","akcenat","31 January 2024","This 2024 action thriller aims high but fails to deliver. While Jason Statham is reliably gritty as ex-operative Adam Clay turned beekeeper, seeking vengeance for his neighbour's suicide, the silly script undermines any gravitas. Overwrought bee metaphors like ""time to smoke out the hornets"" make the premise absurd. Most supporting actors flounder, particularly the miscast female FBI agent (Emmy Raver-Lampman), who is, by the way, a terrible actress. The first half builds narrative momentum around Clay's crusade against predatory scammers, but the stakes needed raising, not contradicting. Once Clay infiltrates the corporation behind the phone schemes, the film descends into generic action movie tropes we've seen done better. Statham's action sequences still pack a punch but can't save the nonsensical plot. Even at a brisk 105 minutes, The Beekeeper starts strongly before losing its narrative sting. This would-be franchise-launcher leaves a bad taste. Not recommended.Rating: 5 out of 10 IMDb stars.","5/10"

I don't wish to put spoilers into this review or give away any of the plot, so I won't, but just to give you an idea of how poor this film is, all the Secret Service agents are running around wearing armoured vests with SECRET SERVICE written on the back in huge letters.

It's a Jason Statham action movie and does not deviate from the pattern. Heck, it's a lesser John Wick. And yet, yeah... the action is good. It's a mindless popcorn flick that escalates quickly, and some will love it for that, however, I see it maybe only being fun after having a few drinks and putting it on with a group of friends - it's pretty silly and very undemanding of its audience.

Easily.By the way, they spent 40 million to do this... I can only imagine Statham walked out of the movie loaded.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","fallyhag","10 February 2024","I went into this film, knowing the actor and knowing what he typically does. All my predictions were correct, this was a lazy story with average CGI and amateur acting.I try to reason with myself explaining that this is a brain switch off film and I should just enjoy the entertainment. However, the story is so painfully bad that I just keep screaming all the way along as it progresses to a ridiculously stupid and nonsensical ending.I did like that the film was addressing the theme of the scammers on the Internet, but was disappointed to see that it glorified the call centres, making them high-tech, exciting and energy driven, rather than the dirty poverty rubbish centres run by desperate people.The action was cliche, and the CGI was absolutely awful in some places. The violence was as expected, and Jason Statham did what he always does, together with his ridiculous voice. Don't get me wrong I like him as an actor, but this was just a very lazy pay cheque.The climax was so poor you literally have to switch your brain off and forget who and where he is going to because if you start to think too much about the details, you will just simply switch off the television and go and paint the garden fence. And don't get me started on the cliche villain who came out of nowhere at the end to help create the bad ass fight scene which wasn't really needed.If you like a lazy film with little to no thinking required, then this one is for you. It will no doubt do well in the box office, then it will join the Z list of ridiculous movies on the bottom shelf.Not recommended. Because it was so lazy!","4/10"
"The Beekeeper","paul_haakonsen","1 March 2024","Of course I sat down to watch the 2024 movie ""The Beekeeper"", as it was starring Jason Statham.Writer Kurt Wimmer put together an enjoyable script and storyline, which proved to be a good old fashioned action thriller. I have to say that while this might be a stereotypical Jason Statham movie, it was really enjoyable. I grew up on the action movies from Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Seagal, and the likes, so of course I enjoy Statham movies a lot as well.I guess, we as the audience are not supposed to question where Adam Clay (played by Jason Statham) keeps getting all the gear that he accumulates in between each different location that he goes through on his way towards his target. And he just conveniently happens to have duffel bags stored away at key locations that happen to be the exact location where he has to go. Makes perfect sense.Of course one can argue for ""The Beekeeper"" being a generic Jason Statham movie, and I won't disagree. And yeah, this is a one man against insurmountable number of enemies and still coming out almost unscathed. But honestly, this type of movie is something that he does quite well, and it is rather enjoyable and entertaining with these hard-hitting action movies, just like the good old 1980s and 1990s action movies.The acting performances in the movie were good, and of course you know what you get with Jason Statham in the lead. It was rather nice to see Phylicia Rashad on the screen, despite it being just for a brief while. And it was also nice to see the likes of Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson on the screen.There is a good amount of action throughout the course of the movie, and again, you know what you get with Jason Statham in the lead. And he definitely delivered once again here with this movie. It was nicely choreographed and executed on the screen. The action certainly adds a lot of flavor to a movie such as ""The Beekeeper"".This is essentially a good popcorn movie.My rating of director David Ayer's 2024 movie ""The Beekeeper"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","theognis-80821","3 February 2024","What is one to do in The Age of John Wick, starring impassive Keanu Reeves? Imitate, of course. Impassive Jason Statham produces and stars. The Beekeeper drives a weather beaten Ford pickup truck, dresses out of the Bass Pro Shop, and is perfectly ordinary, except for one small detail: he's an unbeatable killing machine. He wafts in and out of reality, like a god. When his best friend, an elderly black woman, of course (remember ""The Matrix"" (1999)?), is cheated by online capitalists out of two million dollars and kills herself, he seeks always the most important thing in movies of this type: revenge. FBI? No problem! CIA? No problem! Secret Service? No problem! When special effects, prop masters, stunt men, and wardrobe mistresses are more important than screenwriters, I won't be waiting for The Beekeeper 2, The Beekeeper 3, The Beekeeper 4, The Beekeeper 5....","5/10"
"The Beekeeper","Pairic","14 January 2024","Another film where Jason Statham floats like a butterfly stings like a bee, well he actually stings like a Murder Hornet in this caper. Not that he likes hornets, he's Adam Clay, an actual beekeeper. When online scammers clean out the accounts of a friend of his she commits suicide. Intent on revenge Clay sets out to hunt down those responsible, turns out he's a retired member of a super secret Elite group of assassins named The Beekeepers who operate outside of the Intelligence Community chain of command. Naturally he leaves mayhem in his wake but there's a conspiracy here which has a long reach and connections to the highest echelons of power. Some great hand to hand combat scenes, he takes on crooks, mercenaries and cops/feds by the score. The most unbelievable scene though is when another Beekeeper comes after him, won't reveal the details but nobody could be that crazy! While Clay is happy to shoot, strangle, stab, mutilate and burn alive the scammers and their goons he merely injures the cops/feds, a bit like Arnie in T2 kneecapping the cops. It is a very violent film though and the results are not hidden, lots of gore and corpses. Jeremy Irons dials in a performance as an Ex CIA Director. You will have to turn on your suspension of disbelief app but this is a good a action thriller. Directed by David Ayer, Written by Kurt Wimmer. 7.5/10.","8/10"

What I got was silly and basic action with a plot that just doesn't make any sense and an accent that is confusing.Let me start with the positive. The action was fine but basic. The saving grace was the final fight at the end which I thought was well done. Wish there was more of it throughout the film.What I was hoping for (probably wishful thinking) was a memorable fight scene or action sequence but there wasn't.The accent Jason Statham was trying do, no idea what he was thinking.

"The Beekeeper","jp_91","17 January 2024","""The Beekeeper"" is one of the best action films of recent years, its script that includes living in a bee hive is included in the lives of the human characters, from heroes to villains and results in a well-made story. The cast is good in their performances, although Jason Statham seems to always play the same character, while Josh Hutcherson plays the villain masterfully. The action scenes are exciting and violent, the humor used is very good and sometimes exceeds the ridiculous but manages to achieve its goal. The cinematography is very good, the costume design is outstanding and the digital special effects are a little unrealistic in some scenes. The greatest success of the film is its script, although it is worth mentioning that at times it is implausible but every action film is. A good movie for the beginning of 2024.","8/10"

However, I haven't gone to the cinema for many years because, for me, most films are simply not worth the price of admission.Action films from the USA are by far the worst because they are usually devoid of any humor.

"The Beekeeper","gavinbshort","3 March 2024","""Just a Beekeeper"" sounds like an intriguing premise for a Jason Statham movie! The combination of his action-packed style with a retired hitman seeking revenge could indeed draw comparisons to ""John Wick."" The idea of not messing with the hive adds an interesting twist, hinting at a dangerous adversary with a unique background.From the serene beauty of the beekeeping scenes to the gritty urban landscapes of the action sequences, the film offers a visually captivating experience. Overall, ""Just a Beekeeper"" promises to be a thrilling ride for fans of action movies looking for something fresh and exciting.8.5.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","peeedeee-94281","21 February 2024","I didn't quite understand the whole philosophy behind the 'beekeeper' and how he deals with the hive and all that. It sounded very convoluted, and quite frankly, the metaphor made zero sense.But that was the least of the problems with this movie. It starts off confusing - the woman (Eloise Parker) Jason Statham's character Adam Clay is staying with, gets scammed and takes her life. Wait, this elderly lady is packing a semi automatic pistol in the house? I was expecting that it would turn out she was murdered by the people who's money she lost. There was burning food on the stove, so that seemed like a clue. Nope, she really did do herself in. No attempt to talk to anybody, including her daughter, an FBI agent, to try to fix the situation. The daughter by the way, was dull, and fell shoehorned in. If the daughter stopped showing up in the film, you wouldn't have noticed she was missing.Going back to what sets off Adam Clay in the first place. Statham just happens to drop off a jar of honey at the same time that Parker's daughter happens to show up, and they both see Mother Parker dead. And we learn soon after that she hardly visited her mother, but just happened to visit the house this exact second, no reason. I was expecting that she would say 'my mom's burglar alarm was tripped and I was called to check it out', but nope, just random.Then throughout the movie, Adam Clay goes on a rampage burning down the companies and subcompanies run by the scammer. The big twist, which was also pointless, was this spoiled brat scammer was the son of the current US (woman) president. What? How did that even matter to the story?What is really odd as well, was that Statham's character went on killing people, and beating up law enforcement, but at no time did he show he even know how or tried, to get back any of the money. The charity was still out $2million at the end of the film, and that was pretty much it. He had one big fight with a merc at the end who for whatever reason, it was decided giving him an artificial leg would be a useful plot device. It didn't add much to the fight scene at all.Also disappointing was the earlier fight scene where the 'current' beekeeper is sent to deal with Adam Clay, the former one. SHE goes on a murder rampage at a gas station with a mini gun, and nobody in Law Enforcement seems even mildly astonished at the scale of the damage. It was hilarious how bad this scene was done.Overall a movie that I only give 2 stars because some of the fight scenes were well done, but overall, a waste of time to watch.","2/10"
"The Beekeeper","simplifiyourlifenow","1 February 2024","I've generally liked Statham as an actor. In my mind he's akin to Bruce Willis in his prime.This mind numbing cruedly written film is a stain on his career.One must consider this movie is made to teenagers and the mentally infirm.The acting was wooden with cheesey one liners that went out of fashion in the 1990's.The colourful monkey type creature with the South African accent near the end typified this train wreck of a movie.It was brash, unintelligent, unbelieveable action scenes where Statham carves his way through SWAT and Speicla Forces teams like they're new recruits.If I was 13 I might be in awe of his Superman like skills. However as an adult that's mastered the ability to tie my own shoe laces I watched this nonsense from start to abrupt finish like a stunned mullet.I gave it a 5 just because of the action scenes. Then thought about it more and lowered it to a 4. Then thought about it again and lowered it to a 3.It's a downward spiral really, just like Statham's possible career path.Watch this movie with a good book.","3/10"

The fight scenes are egregious and completely unrealistic, but at least they are back to back with very minimal dialogue in between. The names on the marquis are great, Jeremy irons, Jason Stratham, Felicia Rashad, all brought to shake with this show. The story line might be the worst part and continues to hammer home the bee theme. All of it is just plain terrible.","1/10"
"The Beekeeper","chukkacabra","31 January 2024","Jason Statham, one of my favorite action stars, is back at it again, sporting some of the most hair he's had in years. I'm glad that The Beekeeper is successful, since some of his recent films haven't been as good. It was everything I hoped it would be. Stellar fight choreography, brutal kills, and Josh Hutcherson as an extremely hateable villain. People need to learn to just appreciate strong action flicks, and The Beekeeper is one of the better pure action movies in recent memory, going up there with 'Extraction' and 'John Wick.' If you like action movies and Jason Statham, The Beekeeper is sure to become one of your favorites.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","torrascotia","5 March 2024","Isn't it interesting just how much Argyll has been promoted whereas this seems to have buzzed in from nowhere? Both of these movies sit within the spy/action genre however there is night and day when it comes to which is the superior movie.The Beekeeper is a standard action/revenge flick in which Statham plays his usual action role, except this is more John Wick than giant CGI shark. When a friend commits suicide after been scammed online he sets out to cause some damage. And he does. In spades. While it has a similar premise to the recent Equalizer movies, this one bothers less with the dialogue and seems to fly in as a result. Compared with Argyll which seems to have a teenage girl audience in mind, Beekeeper is strictly aimed at a male demographic that appreciates carnage and takes itself seriously as it does so. Fans of Reacher or Terminal List will enjoy this. The only downside is the obvious sassy black female cop character that feels like its been added to tick a box. Its crazy to think I wasted over two hours on Argyll when I had this waiting on me. The ending was also well executed and the 90 mins simply flew past. Hopefully this gets a sequel.","7/10"

Statham is his usual self, but also better than I've seen him in some of his other recent work.Overall the plot is very basic and predictable, which again is fine because everything else surrounding it was solid.

What the scammers didn't reckon on is her typically stoic, quiet beekeeper, played by Jason Statham, who doth take no ****!

His one-liners come out as normal with a good solid delivery but the directing is lacking.It's just not to par with the genre these das. It's got tired routines and the fact that the President's home would be much more sequre and unpenetrable sums-up the lazy script.We've got two secret units and the FBI and the FBI can't seem to manage a basic operation. This is quite tragic and not real life. There's absolutely no way one man can take out an entire FBI unit and another special ops' unit.It's also unrealistic. How many times to guys get shot then come back again? I lost count.I did like the message it gives as I can't stand modern fraud companies and the stunts were top-tier action people.

I was hoping to see more from the movie as I felt the movie short, so I think that the movie could've been longer. It would be great to have a continuation of this story. Jason Statham's character Adam Clay aka The Beekeeper was really like the best, dangerous and most feared characters throughout the whole movie. So at the end, I'm really hoping that the movie gets multiple sequels, and it was a great time watching The Beekeeper. I would surely recommend others to give this movie a watch and love it, as it's the best film of January that has released.

There are 2 prime actors (Statham, Irons) and some actors with lower profiles and famousness. The story and plot is straight: Revenge with no remorse. There is nothing else. So, one could take that simple thing and go with that and put it in a half-decent, fitting story and script that. What does not fit that script is wooden dialoges, acting and lineup based on a scrummy script and casting. There is simply too much distance and non-fittance in the lineup. Then, there are the story elements after the beginning - again, too much rotten wood. And then, the finale, which is not understandable: Is it a comical, satirical garden party with kids hunting each other or does the producer think, this can be take serous?All in all and unfortunately, a movie, that will be forgotten fast on the heap of kind of too cheap chunk...

Every single movie he touches is the same and you'll be making the same mistake that I did if you hope for something else. Heavens. This movie is awful but it descends into another whole new level of hell when Adam Basil's character comes on. A brutally bad South African accent is actually only the 3rd worst part of this character but its actually exceeded by his painful over-acting and overall implausibility, and the fact that he is dressed like a banana but is allowed to be at a tea party held on the president's estate? All I can say in the man's defence is that he is not alone in the terrible acting that has added no value to the lives of anyone who has seen this movie. My only hope is that the last of the ammunition was saved for the screenwriters and production team.Please run as fast as you can away from this.

He'll stop at nothing to deliver raw justice to those who have it coming to them!I found the film to be ace! You just know within the first 15-20 minutes that The Beekeeper, AKA Jason Statham will deliver the goods as soon those responsible cross the line! The story-line is pretty good & straight forward!

It's a simple story line with plenty of badarse action, explosions & fights to get you through the 1 hour & 40 minute (100 minute) runtime with some fast, high octane action!Jason Statham does it again in this film as he kicks arse & gets the job done! The other characters are pretty good & play their parts really well too! There's also some familiar faces as well so that's also a plus! I honestly, can't think of anything much negative to say about this flick, it's ace & probably one of the best action films I've seen in a long while!Overall, you won't be disappointed by this one, it exceeded my expectations & delivered so it did!

"The Beekeeper","NinaCu","5 February 2024","This appeared to be the usual viligante movie by Jason Stratham, which are usually above average; and which reliably deliver at least somewhat plausible action... Unfortunately, the audio engineering was so poor that the movie was unintelligible -- without a studio quality audio compressor.It seems that the current generation of audio engineers has damaged their hearing with excessively loud music -- to the extent that they have disabled their capacity to effectively engineer audio which properly utilizes the additional dynamic range made available by modern technology.For the rest of you... the objective of greater dynamic range is not to make whspering inaudibly quiet, and explosions make your ears ring. The objective is to expand the range downward, along with the additional reduction of the noise floor. I.e., if you drop the signal to noice ratio from -60dB to -100dB, that allows an increase of dynamic range by 40dB. Specifically, the ability to hear all the audio subtlety and nuance that was previously LOST IN THE NOISE. Instead, contemporary audio engineers merely dispose of that nuance and subtlety, and reduce the speaking level -- to make room for louder explosions.Imagine the same situation for the video presentation, on a screen that could deliver the brightness of the sun (1 Billion NITS). Does that mean the cinematographer should cause the screen to deliver to your eyes, the full level of looking into the sun? (unless of course the objective is to show the sun and make you cover your eyes).Since I couldn't hear Stratham's whistering, under all the overemphasized explosions, gunshots, crashes etc... There really was no point watching the movie after about 22 minutes.An unlistenable movie gets ZERO STARS.SHAME ON AMAZON for creating junk like this, to foster PRIME media dis-service.","1/10"
"The Beekeeper","Luv2Spooge","31 January 2024","There's been a few really cheesy movies out about assassins, ex-cia, etc... with names like The Painter, The Bricklayer, etc.. etc... I just naturally assumed this would be another lame low budget B movie. However, this is anything but. For starter the plot is actually much more developed, Beekeeper actually means more than simply some hero's nickname.Of course a Statham film you expect a lot of awesome fight scenes and they deliver. It is like John Wick except with kicks, punches, and is actually good. I think it is especially enjoyable when the villain are a bunch of call center scam artists.The final revelation was also extremely satisfying, watching the Beekeeper enacting justice on Hunter Bid... err... I mean... Derek Danforth. I thought the mockery of the office of the president was also clever. She is a combination of Biden (awful son), Hillary (woman president), and Trump (business tycoon). I guess everyone of all political affiliation can appreciate this film.8/10.","8/10"

And beside the storyline, her acting was terrible.And what was up with the yellow rambo figure at the end? They wanted to bring some comedy into the movie? Again: it made no sense.If your looking for some hardcore fighting, then you should watch this, because the fighting scenes were great and pretty brutal. But don't expect much more from this movie.

"The Beekeeper","HabibieHakim123","19 January 2024","I'm a Statham believer, no matter how bad or awful the movie was it surely not Jason Statham because he always bring an awesome performance and aura that even though it's the same it didn't matter, The Beekeeper was one of the actual great one, directed by David Ayer, Statham was an unstoppable menace in this movie, sure Statham didn't need to do all those stuff because of the reason but who cares, it's a freaking Jason Statham movie that besides that, the movie actually have an interesting good story telling with great performances by all the cast including Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons, except probably the two main cops they were ok although they also the weakest part of this movie, everything was so interesting and exciting but everytime they get back to the two cops i've always feel like it was a downer tone, it could've been perfect if either they trimmed down a bit or actually have also an interesting scene just like the rest of the film, i didn't hate all of their scene though, anyway, overall i was quite surprise on how The Beekeeper actually not became a pretty bad B-movie action film starring Jason Statham but instead being actually a great movie, i have a blast in the theaters, those fight scene are so great and brutal, my man Jason Statham was never fail to get me personally excited, i love that man so much, The Beekeeper was surprisingly one of the great 2024 opener, already one of the best films of the year.","9/10"
"The Beekeeper","alwinsup","2 February 2024","A good none brain thinking action movie. Plenty of things happen during the movie. Good amount of action, story line, acting, build-up time, etc, etc.Jason Statham, as always, delivers his A-performance. At first I was doubtfull; will it not be a movie that is put togheter in less then 4 weeks? However it has a decent quality. People clearly thought about the story line before shooting it. The extra deepness of the story arround the ''bee-keepers'' instead of just acting the average middle class guy gave it a nice extra touch.Just buy your snacks and drink and relax a bit!

"The Beekeeper","mecanik-1447","16 January 2024","This movie, 'The Beekeeper,' is precisely the kind of film the world desperately needs at this moment. In an age where scamming has become an unfortunate part of our daily lives, happening every day, every hour, every minute, this movie shines a much-needed spotlight on these deceitful practices. Its impactful narrative and compelling storytelling have the power to open eyes and potentially bring about a significant change. Hopefully, it will make more people aware, leading to these scammers finally going out of business. 'The Beekeeper' isn't just a film; it's a masterpiece that blends entertainment with a powerful message, a cinematic gem that could play a crucial role in changing societal perspectives and practices. A must-watch for anyone who believes in the power of cinema to inspire and effect real-world change.","10/10"

Why was she trying to stop the beekeeper from avenging her mother's death? Lol.Josh Hutcherson, seems to have left his acting skills in his childhood. Jeremy irons also sucked. All the characters lacked depth or authenticity.Jason Statham is how he always is, which is fine, but his accent was confusing, not sure if he was English, Scottish or American.

"The Beekeeper","PedroReviews","3 February 2024","Jason Statham returns to the screen in ""The Beekeeper"" (2024), wielding his fists and signature stoicism with gritty aplomb. While the plot might be as familiar as your worn-out leather jacket, the action sequences pack a punch that'll leave you buzzing with adrenaline.Statham embodies Clay, a beekeeper with a past as an elite operative known as ""The Beekeeper."" When his kindhearted landlady becomes the victim of a phishing scam, Clay unleashes his particular brand of revenge, his sting sharp and unforgiving. Think Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills with a beehive beard and a penchant for blunt instruments.The plot unfolds like a well-worn action movie map. You've got the wronged protagonist, the ruthless villain (played with deliciously evil glee by Stanley Tucci), and a trail of bodies leading to a showdown. But hey, sometimes comfort food just hits the spot, and ""The Beekeeper"" serves up a satisfying helping of vengeance with a side of well-choreographed fight scenes.Now, let's talk action. Statham does what he does best: dispatching bad guys with balletic brutality. Bullets whiz past him like angry bumblebees, but Clay remains miraculously unscathed. It's a bit like watching Neo dodge bullets in ""The Matrix,"" but somehow grounded in the grimy reality of this film's world. It's over-the-top, sure, but hey, that's part of the fun, right?What ""The Beekeeper"" lacks in narrative originality, it makes up for in its timely context. The film touches on themes of online scams and the vulnerability of everyday people, adding a layer of relevance that resonates in today's digital age. It's not exactly groundbreaking social commentary, but it gives the action a touch of weight beyond pure entertainment.So, is ""The Beekeeper"" a masterpiece of cinema? No, but it's a perfectly enjoyable action flick that delivers exactly what you expect from a Jason Statham movie: bone-crunching action, a sprinkle of dark humor, and a plot that, while predictable, doesn't get in the way of the punches and bullets. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush and a reminder that Statham can still kick some serious butt, then ""The Beekeeper"" might just sting you in the right way. Just remember, don't try any of his moves at home...or maybe just don't get involved in phishing scams.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","neil-476","25 January 2024","When online scammers strip Eloise of every penny, leading to her suicide, her beekeeper friend Clay determines that there needs to be some accountability.You know what you're getting with a Jason Statham film - it does what it says on the tin. And the action subgenre ""You shouldn't have messed with someone who has a friend/family member with a very particular set of skills"" is always enormously satisfying when well handled.And it is well handled here, both the hand-to-hand stuff, and the broader set pieces.The scammers in this case aren't based in Mumbai but are much closer to home, and there are some fun plot twists. The supporting cast are good (Josh Hutcherson is very effective as the chief (or is he?) baddie).This is a satisfying action thriller, with an ending which is about 5 minutes too abrupt - there are several characters/threads which deserved a bit more wrap-up.","7/10"

Is it fun to watch, yes.I do wonder how much longer Statham can keep making movie like this, been 56 years old. But I suspect this movie will be successful enough to spawn at least one more.

"The Beekeeper","trevorwomble","29 January 2024","This is actually one of Statham's better films of the last few years. An original story about a mysterious agent seeking revenge on the despicable con men who indirectly caused the death of his friend and neighbor starts a chain of events that spiral out of control.This is pretty standard stuff for Statham but it's very well directed by David Ayer and has a good solid cast. Statham was never particularly good at accents but at least his weird hybrid is explained in the story. However as expected he excels at the well filmed action sequences, and although there is a certain preposterousnesd that someone as distinctive looking as him can somehow keep evading capture without a disguise, his coolness in a gunfight is part of his charm. It's just the Stath doing what he does best, beating people up who step in the way of his retribution for an evil act.There's blood, gore and violence as well as bad language (although he rarely swears here) and the film is a great popcorn movie providing you don't mind that sort of thing. Statham may not be the worlds greatest actor but he's not terrible either. He knows what he's doing in films like this and does it very well, especially with a solid director like Ayer behind the camera.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","imdb-23821","14 January 2024","I love Jason Statham. I'll watch his nonsense like Crank, The Transporter (all three), and it's painfully fun to watch his best like Lock Stock and Snatch. But this dumb vehicle he walks through as does the rest of the cast, without even trying. Even the script seems to mock the audience and I'd say a poor man's John Wick 1 but that's a slap in the face to the poor version.Does this sound familiar? Wealthy magnate has son who is a brat and runs his own lower grade scams. One happens to hit close to Statham, just a quiet beekeeper. Without an effort, J calls up his posse to find out who it is and nobody knows. J decides to walk through the front door, wreak havoc, and let the FBI fumble at who this man of ultimate devastation can be for half the film. That's after he practically broadcast himself.Move forward and it only gets sillier and lazier. J must take down the entire organization. You could throw the army, navy, air force and marines at J but he'll walk in without a gun and let his super fast hands of steel (ala camera slight of hand) do the talking. Then he'll go John Wick style through all of them, even without a weapon, through dozens of them. Imagine a superhero film.There is really no point. Something about a beekeper, a hive, a queen bee, none of it really needing to make sense, just to sound diabolical. The problem is this isn't a parody nor meant to be one. It was just lazy junk. The ending might be the funniest of all, being only interested in a sequel. Don't say you weren't warned.","2/10"

The villains here are so annoyingly smug you'll be waiting for Statham to get at them. Josh Hutcherson plays his role pretty well, acting like he is high part of the time, and Jeremy Irons is also good, although very little is done with him.

"The Beekeeper","toonarly","31 January 2024","After the bricklayer, and the painter, now we have the beekeeper. Jason Statham definitely is the action star, his choreography and attention to story and detail is awesome in his latest action entree. Non stop action as he does justice on a massive hacker conglomerate that tricks innocent people out of their life savings (this is actually a true activity going on today) he is unstoppable and the fight scenes are amazing, keeps you glued to the screen the whole time. Sets up for a sequel as well. Like the bricklayer and the painter he's just an average Joe living a peaceful life as a beekeeper until he's driven out of ""retirement"" by forces unseen who destroy his benefactor and friend in a viscous data hack and causes them to commit suicide. There are a few people out there in todays world that do go after these despicable groups who do this heinous hack crime and kudos to all of them. This is taking it to the next level, makes me wonder if the current administration did the same thing to get elected, who knows. Most enjoyable fun I've seen in years. Nothing questionable, no nudity, lots of foul language and intense violence and gore. Not for the squeamish or young kids for sure. Enjoy!","10/10"
"The Beekeeper","coastdaze","13 January 2024","It's a shame that action movies don't have a category of their own. Statham never disappoints me. I think this is one of his best movies, but I generally like them all. I am a woman and I don't know any other woman who likes action movies like I do, unfortunately. The Beekeeper is a 2 hour romp into that genre of movie that makes me hope there are men like this in the world. Beekeeper flows well, the action is top notch and fun, maybe a little shocking at times. Well-written screenplay. Nice photography, too. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Sure, some may say Statham always plays the same type of character...why not, he's great at it. And his co-star, Raver-Lampman, wow. I like this gal and I don't remember seeing her in a movie before. I feel the same about Naderi. I'd sure like to see another great script in B2. I don't think the Beekeeper/Agent Parker justice storyline is done yet. Oh, and it was so good to see Rashad again, it's been too long. Jeremy Irons, too. Fun ride.","10/10"
"The Beekeeper","stevendbeard","13 January 2024","I saw The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham-the Expendables movies, the Fast & the Furious movies; Emmy Raver_Lampman-The Umbrella Academy_tv, Central Park_tv; Josh Hutcherson-Five Nights at Freddy's, the Hunger Games movies and Jeremy Irons-House of Gucci, Assassin's Creed.This is an action packed Jason Statham movie and I think it's Jason at his best. Jason plays a beekeeper that takes care of bees. He lives in the barn of an elderly lady while doing his bee business-collecting the honey, etc. When she is scammed out of all her money, she commits suicide which makes Jason mad. That is when you find out that Jason is also another type of beekeeper. There is an organization called Beekeepers that takes care of things the regular police or F. B. I. Can not-or won't-handle. Jason is retired but decides to come out of retirement and use his skills to bring justice to the bad guys by tracking them down and eliminating them, one by one. Emmy is the F. B. I. Agent trying to stop Jason and Josh is the bad guy running the scamming business through several locations. Jeremy plays an ex C. I. A. Agent that works for Josh and knows how dangerous the Beekeepers are and tries to warn Josh about who he is messing with. There are lots of great fight scenes as the F. B. I., police, S. W. A. T.-and even another Beekeeper-try to stop Jason.It's rated R for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.","9/10"

"The Beekeeper","sinscopefilms","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper (2024) dazzles with its masterful cinematography. The film utilizes a mix of one-shots, medium, and full shots, with the characters artfully positioned at the center which was a standout feature of the film. These shots are rich in detail, benefitting from exceptional lighting that adds an impressive depth to each scene. The camera shots during the at night scenes are exceptionally clear, and the slow zoom-ins and outs are executed flawlessly.The cinematography is further elevated by inventive techniques, such as the seamless rotation from a 90-degree angle to a flat landscape view in the drone shots, adding a dynamic layer to the visual storytelling.The film draws inspiration from the atmospheric tones of Interstellar (2014) in its musical composition. The score is a fascinating blend of horror film elements, electronic stutters, and cinematic Hans Zimmer brass, creating an immersive auditory experience that complements the film's tone perfectly.Action sequences in 'The Beekeeper' are nothing short of breathtaking. Their realism is so striking that they left me in awe, my reaction a mix of surprise and excitement. These scenes are meticulously choreographed, echoing the intense action of Tenet (2020) while maintaining their unique flair.At the heart of the film is the protagonist, Adam Clay, a hitman characterized by his strategic brilliance. Clay's ability to think 15-20 steps ahead in order to unravel a scammer fraud scheme adds a gripping, intellectual element to this action thriller. The film, while drawing parallels with Saw X (2023), stands out with its unique narrative focused on scammer themes.I felt that The Beekeeper (2024) could benefit from a brief epilogue scene, despite its numerous strengths. Adding an exploration of Adam Clay's life after the climactic events of the film could have brought more depth to the story. This brief glimpse into his future could have provided a sense of closure to his character arc, giving the audience a deeper understanding of his transformation and the impact of his choices. A scene like that would have given the film a more complete ending and added depth to its emotional impact.In conclusion, 'The Beekeeper (2024)' is a cinematic treat, a guilty pleasure that blends masterful cinematography, a captivating score, and thrilling action sequences into a unique and memorable film experience.","9/10"
"The Beekeeper","donmurray29","12 January 2024","Giving this an 8/10 ratingDavid Ayer has been quiet on the film making front, but he is back, with this superb guilty pleasure action film. Writer Kurt Wimmer teams up with Jason Statham again, but this time the result is much better.There is much fighting, lots of great humour and yes there is a story, which is brought really to light by a much beer than I expected script, and some proper good acting, and the direction and pace is sedate in the right places, then bursts of action when it's needed.Jeremy Irons is very super cool and elegant all the way though, Jason Statham is totally driven as the beekeeper, and you learn a lot about bees along the way, Emmy Raver-Lampman is focused and also driven, Bobby Naderi is the suffering partner who is very sarcastic, but most of all, Josh Hutcherson, who was last seen in 'Five Nights at Freddie's' has fun with his role switch, his character is dislikable and we all have meet people in real like like him, he's superb too.This is more like 'Nobody', that stared Bob Odenkirk, not 'John Wick', which I have been reading companions too.

All of the top stars are in ""let's get this one over with"" mode. By the end I was hoping one of the bad guys would just shoot Statham's character instead of standing there pointing their gun at him and waiting for him to knock them cold.The only way that a film like this could maintain interest is if the fight scenes showed some variety as the story goes along.

"The Beekeeper","ykjdh","14 January 2024","If you're one of those wannabe social media, siskel and ebert fake critics, then you'll probably dislike this movie because it's not artsy fartsy or cinematic for you. For those of us who like action movies on the other hand know what we get with a Jason Statham movie. This one will not disappoint as it's a fast moving, exciting, piece of action that's worthy of the $11 ticket price.Some of the best action sequences on film are here with a pretty decent little revenge story. I found myself rooting for Statham as he kicks apart the greedy corporate culture that preys on unsuspecting people.Turns out his character is one you don't want to mess with or piss off especially when it comes to his friends. I found myself comparing the current presidential administration and tried to figure out was this the useless child of our current commander in chief or that person who lost in 2016. Anyhow, grab some popcorn and prop your feet up. Sit back and enjoy one of the best action movies to come out in a long time.","10/10"
"The Beekeeper","cassidyblay","1 February 2024","Just caught this movie and I've got to say, I really enjoyed it. The film is a straight shot of adrenaline, packed with the kind of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Statham, as always, delivers a powerhouse performance, embodying the role with the intensity and charisma we've come to expect from him.However, the movie wasn't without its flaws. The supporting cast left something to be desired. Their performances felt a bit superficial, lacking the depth needed to make the characters truly believable. There was one character in particular, whose reaction to her mother's death (a central plot point) felt off-more excited than devastated, which felt jarring given the context.Despite this, the film had its high points. The humor injected through some of the characters was a welcome relief, balancing out the tension with well-timed laughs. In summary, ""The Beekeeper"" nails it as an action-packed ride, thanks to Statham and the comedic moments, even if it stumbles a bit with its supporting cast.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","Mrbigham13","20 January 2024","I decided to see what all the Buzz was about tonight and take a look at this recent flick. This is just another run of the mill Statham action flick, but this time with a real sting in the end. Jason Statham the man I grew up with as ""The Transporter"" kicks ass per usual. The set pieces suffice with some obvious CGI explosions here and there. The supporting actors are good enough and of course all the villains are white with the ""United Nations"" of heroes serving as the FBI.This story really goes out on a limb, as do most action flicks these days. The political satire was just about as dumb as the real thing. I enjoyed the pot shots towards the Biden and Clinton crime families. Overall it's not a bad movie if you turn off your mind which seems to be all we do these days considering the low quality ""woke"" entertainment we're fed. What we have here is a real honeypot of cliche action mixed with standard modern day ideology. Nothing groundbreaking but pretty much expected, check it out.","6/10"

"The Beekeeper","pixrox1","17 January 2024",". . . is exactly WHICH Real Life American Presidential son THE BEEKEEPER is after. Many contend that it is the Weasel Shrub. However, a nearly equal number of commentators argue in favor of Don Juan, Jr. The True Facts favoring the former correlation includes top CIA family connections, a rigged election decided in a disrespected kangaroo court and a well-known history of alcohol and drug abuse by the sordid Skull & Bones Club whelp. Couple this with the thoroughly documented Texas barbecue during which details such as the unprecedented September 2001 Homeland Security Air Force stand-down to enable Manhattan's destruction by picnic guest O. B. L. And his henchmen and you have a very strong case for the fictional beekeeper offing a stand-in for the Weasel. However, given the still-missing folder of Tip-Top Secret nuclear codes and the KGB's first success at planting an agent and his Iron Curtain Third Lady in the West Wing, paired with his rants on the Voice of Lenin TV channel dominating Red State television screens, and Don Juan II seems to be an equally likely candidate for the beekeeper's mode of vigilante justice.

The landlady of his bee-keeping farm is scammed out of her life savings by one of those computer hacking gangs. This is an operation in America and, as we all know, they are NEVER in the US - (silly plot error.) The landlady shoots herself and The beekeeper (Statham) decides to wreak vengeance on the perpetrators in his own inimitable style. His American accent is as unconvincing as a pantomime horseAs it turns out the boss of the computer hackers is the (female) US president's son. - A sleazy coke snorting character modelled after a certain other president's coke snorting son. The female president is modelled after a certain female who had (unrequited and unrealized) US presidential aspirations. She initially appears ghastly and amoral and, at the end has an epiphany and realises that she has to do the right thing and 'fess up... (silly plot error). The president's son is shot by Stathan, who manages to slip out of the white house, amidst millions of SWAT police who can't hit a barn door at ten paces with their automatic weapons. Jeremy Irons puts in an unnecessary appearance as an ex CIA director and - just when you think that Statham's fake US accent is the worst on earth, Jeremy Irons proves you wrong.Stratham, puts on a diving suit and swims out to freedom.As I'm writing this I can't believe anyone would write something so utterly inane - but there you go. It seems as if Hollywood has gone, not just insane but puerile as well.Should you see this film? Absolutely! It's as beserk a comic book action lunacy as it gets. It's so silly, that it's worth watching to see the depths that Hollywood can go to.Watch it, but for goodness sake, don't watch it at the cinema (someone might see you).","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","mats-johansson78","18 February 2024","The beekeeper is an action packed movie naturally, since it's Jason Statham, in the main role!The acting is fair, it's not something to get excited over either way. The combat scenes are properly choreographed, well the scenes with talking moving the plot forward is fairly smooth.You have to suspend any critical thinking, but it is enjoyable watching him kick ass as usual with some popcorn, Coke or a beer. It's an afternoon other than that. The only spectacular thing about this movie is it's lack of originality which works for me since I had an afternoon off With nothing better to do!I wish they used real honey in one scene instead of using water, but that's the only thing I'm really bothered about actually üòÉ","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","panagiotis1993","2 February 2024","My Live Reaction / Review for The Beekeeper (2024): I have a feeling that this movie is gonna be good, let's see if im right or wrong. What is this? A group of people? A company that hacks random old people? Makes no sense. The poor lady killed herself after what happened? That's so sad. Adam is going to do something about it, I like it. Some really good fight scenes already! What Adam does is badass and everything but isnt he worried about the police? 40 minutes in and the movie is so good so far. I love that Jeremy Irons is in this one, I really enjoy his acting.So Adam was part of a secret group called the Beekeepers and now the same people will have to try and kill him? An all out war is coming, I like it. So Adam's next victim is POTUS or her son? Or both? Cant wait for Derek to die, he is so annoying! I like the president, she is honest. Wow, he gave that guy with the yellow short a really good beating. Derek is dead, hell yes. Overall the movie is pretty good. Good direction, an ok plot, good performances, intense action, fight scenes, explosions and more. It has everything you need, my rating is 8/10.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","mags-06346","3 February 2024","The Beekeeper has a storyline that is simple, but keeps developing. It has a good vs evil plot, which can be satisfying. There are a few surprises which keep the viewer intrigued. Jason Statham is in a typical role, which he pulls off in his quiet way. There are fewer killings than the John Wick movies. If you like violent movies, this has got it. Here his skills are unrealistic, but the plot develops that sufficiently. The twists and turns keep it interesting and entertain. The movie does teach about beekeeping, so you may learn a few things. And, the bigger social issue here of taking advantage of people deserves a public conversation. So A+ to the cast and director for bringing this up.","9/10"
"The Beekeeper","jzrises","13 January 2024","I did not expect much before watching it, but after coming out of the theater, I just want to tell other potential audience- don't waste your time and money. The movie is trying to creat a hero, but at what cost? Killing dozens of innocent civilians ? The No. 1 bad guy needs to rely on fraudulent money from those elder people whereas his mother is the president?.... The whole story is brain damaged made. Jason should not accept such a role in his career . Hollywood should stop using those no brain made scripts but review themselves on how to make really meaningful movies, like Godzilla minus one.","1/10"
"The Beekeeper","Cinema-reviewer321","31 January 2024","What I expected from an action movie starring Jason Statham called The Beekeeper (2024) was that it was going to be a dumb fun action movie with entertaining action and a great performance from the lead actor, along with the director David Ayer giving the movie some kind of style to it; after watching the movie I got what I thought I was going to get, and had an entertaining time watching it. The action movie The Beekeeper (2024) is an entertaining, dumb, and fun action movie that does not take itself too seriously with the lead star being cool to watch, the action sequences being well done, and having simple but easy to hate antagonists; this movie does have issues like some of the dialogue and how the third act is played out, but if you think about any issues in the movie, then the whole thing will fall apart, which is why I say it's a dumb and fun action movie.Jason Stathan as Adam Clay was great to watch him go on a revenge quest to get back at a big company of scammers that did something wrong to a person that he knew that lead to her being killed, so it is satisfying to see him kill off these bad people because you know they have wronged him in such a way that should not happen again; I also liked the certain skills he has in fighting, knowing ways to get in a building, and how he handles situations. Seeing him do his beekeeping job was fine and I liked how he uses certain beekeeping methods against people he is fighting; other than him, there is the daughter of the person Adam Clay knew who died and she is some kind of FBI agent following the brutal trail of murders from Adam Clay leading to the higher ups of the scamming company, but her moments at crime scenes were a bit unnecessary and was not that interesting even though it could have been, since she is connected to someone we know.The antagonist is mainly Josh Hutcherson's character who is a spoiled rich jerk who takes the money from the scammers and puts it out to other companies he owns, or he just uses it for pointless stuff leading to him unknowingly angering Adam Clay; the other character who is more of a father figure to Josh Hutcherson's character is played by Jeremy Irons, who has something to do with what is happening in the company, but not completely where he is also the Beekeeper's target. The action sequences are fun, well-choreographed, barely has any cuts, and is cool seeing the actor Jason Statham perform them with cool stunts and brutal kills in entertaining ways; Adam Clay does make quite a few bee puns, which can be unintentionally funny becomes the movie does not take itself too seriously, but sometimes the lines of dialogue could get weird and just too cheesy on how they are said. I do like the information we get on the organization known as ""Beekeepers"" and how they are used to protect people or protect the ""Hive"" leading to them having fun with the idea, but the third act took itself seriously on how it played out and how people were acting; it should have just kept going down the path of not taking itself too seriously.The Beekeeper (2024) has its issues, but it is a dumb and fun action movie starring Jason Statham that I was entertained by, and while watching thought it was like the other action movie John Wick (2014); the performances are good, the action sequences are fun, and the antagonist is simple and easy to hate so you can be satisfied by what happens to him. If you like cheesy dumb action movies, I would recommend this movie to you, but if you do not like intentionally funny and dumb action movies, then you should not watch this; I expected this movie to be fun and entertaining, and that is what I got.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","bradencn","4 February 2024","Listen, I knew what to expect going into this film as far as what kind of movie it would be. Statham plays a great bad ass, and good guys (or guy) are fighting bad guys, and it's clear who's who.But by golly, folks, can we stop pretending that women are hard core police agents and leaders/directors of secret mercenary organizations? It just distracts completely from what I came to watch, it is dishonest and disingenuous, and it's an insult to viewers who just want to enjoy a work of art. For a work if art to have relevance, it HAS to reflect the human experience.So - will this movie resonate with action thriller chancing movie goers? Yes, it's worth watching on a steaming service, but...will the macho women scenes bother and distract you? Yes...further, they will annoy you.I wish Emmy Raver-Lampman a great career, but this movie makes it seem like she is just begging for relevance, and it's probably not even her fault... It's the fault of the writers, the casting requirements, etc.I didn't even mind the dumb dialogue. I came for the action, and I got the action... But it somehow got mixed with visual preaching that women can only be bad asses if they can be like men. Nah...not buying it.","5/10"
"The Beekeeper","ryanwgordon","3 February 2024","I have watched a lot of bad movies these days. I may be on the minority, but I actually even thought John Wick 4 was overrated. The bullet proof jackets were a bit of overkill. Expendables 4 was so bad, that I can barely remember what happened in most of the movie. But this one I actually enjoyed. Could the writing have been a lot better, sure. But I didn't put this movie on hoping for an Oscar award winning movie. My only gripe is that the ending was a bit anti climatic for me. They could have written it a bit better. Overall, I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again with my wife if she can stay awake long enough for it.","8/10"

He carried this movie, which has a great base plot, but totally fails on delivery and back story. They took a fantastic and interesting concept, and completely wasted it. They need to remove it from theaters, edit out everything but Statham being Statham. Movie would have made more sense without a plot.Is Hollywood hard up for writers these days? Was the entire budget spent on Statham and the rights to the subject material? Has to be the case. Credits should have rolled after he torched and blew up the first building belonging to the film's ""villains"".Two things are true about The Beekeeper...

"The Beekeeper","r96sk","1 February 2024","I'm conflicted about 'The Beekeeper'.On the one hand, it's fantastic entertainment as Jason Statham plays a brilliantly badass character - every scene with him is top, top notch. The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.Away from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. On the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.Raver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.The scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term shudder) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.I'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.","8/10"

"The Beekeeper","giffon","10 February 2024","Jason Statham always delivers action. The hand to hand is almost always well done with good to superior choreography. Fortunately for his fans he has reached a new level,

Every level of crime in this movie is taken from todays news report. From data mining senior citizens to political king making it is clear evidence that the American society is on it's way to being the next to fall off the cliff.Could there be a solution to that?

Jason Statham does his usual bald British tough guy thing. This may not be groundbreaking, however as usual it is entertaining to watch him beat up FBI agents and criminals alike. Josh Hutcherson does surprisingly well as the movies villain. He does a very good job of playing a spoiled rich doosh bag that manages to get into WAY over his head. Several famous actors of yesteryear make appearances just to not do much and disappear after one or two scenes. There is also one major plot thread that is just dropped about halfway through the movie. Over all I feel pretty confident giving this movie a seven out of ten.","7/10"

Everything seems plausible.I am so elated by this film that I even mustered the time and engagement to write a review. That leads to a slightly unrelated issue, which is why is IMDB forcing one to write 500 words review.

I and my girlfriend were riveted to the end. The people who get by with this crime every day deserve justice. Unfortunately, the law gets in the way. Statham balances the scales.

At 42 I still cheer, when good guys rough up bad guys. But The Beekeeper faces dozens of trained men head-on, no weapon in hand. (As if they were just regular people from the street,) And two characters were way over the top. The female Beekeeper was comically over the top. As was the blond merc towards the end.The fight scenes and the action, however are beautifully done. The whole movie is beautiful.A bit of modesty here and there, would have scored a 9/10.The last point deduction would be the yuppie villains that are also a bit cartoonish in their behavior (except Jeremy Irons).Still waiting for that one perfect Statham movie.","7/10"

Jason Statham did what he always does best, fighting with a plain face and a lot of action. There are plenty of enjoyable moments here, and audiences who want nothing more than a Jason Statham beat-'em-up will surely be satisfied.There's a half-hearted plot twist that doesn't land. Mostly, however, this is a film about explosions and bad guys getting their comeuppance. Fast cuts and more than 50 credited stuntmen and stuntwomen make for, well, buzzy spectacle. A semi-confusing script and heavy-handed direction from David Ayer muddle the proceedings, but enough inspired pizazz and Statham's earnest delivery of lines like ""I protect the hive"" just barely bring it all home.My Rating : 6.5/10.","6/10"

The two combined forces to develop a story that can best be described as ""every film Charles Bronson ever made with software revisions by a programmer called John Wick."" The action starts almost immediately and then just goes. If you like memes and themes with your action, then there are some scenes where the importance of being nice to older people pop up, and also also some talk of the importance of being a good person. But all that is just talk. At the end of the day (and by the end of the film), the action takes center stage. It helps if you know the filmography of both Bronson and Statham (which would help you relate to the ""be nice to old people"" meme), but you can also enjoy a cold viewing if needs be.

"The Beekeeper","destroyerwod","31 January 2024","Lets be 100% honest, this is the most John Wick clone of all John Wick clones that i have seen. Is it a n√©gative? Absolutely NOT !This movie was awesome in its own right. Instead of a retired assassin who got wronged, here you have a retired super special agent who got wronged. Everyone tremble at the mere mention of his name. And he can dispatch pretty much anybody with super badass moves unless he reach his target. Sounds familiar? Everything in the structure of the movie, even to the ""special organization using outdated tech that somehow can find everything"", is very similar to John Wick. The bee theme is likely the only thing that is remotely original.But as i said in the intro, its not a negative for me. I like those action movies that were inspired by John Wick and if done properly like in this case, i would take a lot more. The story is simple but coherent, having Jason Statham as the lead assure a solid screen presence, the action is very good, and the movie as little timeoffs clocking at only 100 minutes or so. Its one of those solid action movies where you just buckle up for the ride and before you can even realize it, the movie is over.I don't buy as much movies on physical format these days as i used to, but its one that i will add to the collection.

"The Beekeeper","dubond","31 January 2024","Don't let the January burial deter you from THE BEEKEEPER, a wild action thriller that works by enthusiastically embracing just how ludicrous it is, with every member of the cast, even down to the smallest role, knowing exactly what kind of movie they're in.In one of his best films, Jason Statham *IS* Adam Clay, a loner beekeeper renting a barn on the property of elderly widow Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise commits suicide after losing her entire savings in a computer virus phishing scam, Clay vows that those reponsible will pay, and he'd preferably do so without the involvement of Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Clay manages to find the office complex of the data mining outfit that conned Eloise, takes out several security goons and burns the place to the ground. All of this happens in the first ten minutes, which gives you an idea of just how hard THE BEEKEEPER hits the ground running and never stops. The data mining outfit is one of many overseen by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), a douchey, skateboarding billionaire tech bro rich kid who leaves the legalities and the paperwork to absurdly-named trusted family friend Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons), a former CIA director who has agreed to run the Danforth dynasty in the place of Derek's absent mother. When Westwyld reaches out to the current CIA director (Minnie Driver) and is told that all evidence points to Clay being a ""beekeeper,"" she wishes Westwyld the best of luck and extricates herself and the agency from the situation.What follows is absolute madness that almost makes this Statham's PUNISHER: WAR ZONE. It's the best film in years from either director David Ayer, who's a much better writer (TRAINING DAY, DARK BLUE) than a filmmaker (HARSH TIMES, SABOTAGE, SUICIDE SQUAD, BRIGHT, THE TAX COLLECTOR) or journeyman screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who's never lived up to the promise of 2002's EQUILIBRIUM. There's a jaw-dropper of a reveal midway through that I won't spoil, but this is Statham at his stoical, vengeful best, a welcome return to form after last fall's unwatchable EXPEND4BLES fiasco.THE BEEKEEPER is impossible to take seriously on any level, other than the palpable rage it shows toward greedy tech outfits that would con the elderly (it also doesn't seem likely that the FBI would let Verona work a case that indrectly involves her mother), but once all the pieces are in play, it also takes some pointed jabs at much bigger subjects. With perhaps the fewest lines he's ever had in a movie, Statham creates one of his most memorable and merciless characters, and the over-the-top, cathartically crowd-pleasing ways The Beekeeper comes up with to dispose of the bad guys had the small matinee audience rolling with laughter. Yeah, CGI explosions are apparently always gonna blow, but we've already got a contender for the year's most stupidly entertaining movie.","7/10"

Like the rest of the genre, you do not go into these films expecting deep insights into human nature, erudite dialogue, and so on. So it is with the Beekeeper. Except this outing was nicely polished. The characters were typically shallow, but did have interesting backstories. And the baddies were almost believable. Of course, there were oddities and plot holes. And the fight scenes were impressively over-the-top ridiculous. It is non-stop action with an occasional bit of dialogue to glue things together.

You have to be able to get over that otherwise you will never like a movie with Jason Statham. I found The Beekeeper one of his better ones. A good revenge story, with of course an overload of action scenes. The cinematography was of good quality, nicely choreographed fighting scenes, and good actors. Of course I wished it would look a bit more realistic, like almost everyone of us, but it is what it is, a Jason Statham movie. If one day he could take out villains in a normal way I think that movie could score higher. I would have scored The Beekeeper higher if it wasn't Jason against fifty highly trained killers, preferably all at once of course.","7/10"

"The Beekeeper","daisukereds","1 February 2024","Jason Statham remains a quality lead, and an action actor to be respected.. even if the vehicles he is in sometimes stink.Thankfully, the Beekeeper is cheese enough to be enjoyable! With great build-up, increasing stakes, ""good"" bad people (not liking Hutcherson helped a lot, great casting) and dumb enough developments to be fun. But there's an underlying sense of competence that allows you to be entertained, and not laugh at the movie's expense.. maybe the dialogue could have been improved, but the general idea and execution is solid. The Equalizer comparison is quite apt!Easy recommendation for fans of the actor and action scenes with a purpose.If allowed, I'd give this half a point more than I did.","7/10"

"The Beekeeper","lisaaltmiller","20 February 2024","This film doesn't deserve the bad reviews. If you are going into an action movie thinking the plot is going to be perfect, then maybe action isn't your genre. If you're going into it wanting to be entertained, with lots of fight scenes and things blowing up, then you'll enjoy this movie. Think of something along the lines of The Equalizer meets James Bond. It'll even make you laugh a few times. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a sequel or two. Is Jason Statham a great actor? No. But is he great in action films like this, that are written for someone like him, yes. It's an entertaining.fast watch.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","SlashedProductions","11 January 2024","Sure, it's stuff you've seen before. And maybe you've even seen it done better in other films. But Jason Statham beating up bad guys will never get old.The Beekeeper wouldn't work without Statham, and the movie knows it. It has fun with its premise and keeps a brisk pace. Last month's Silent Night was also a been-there-done-that action flick, but it didn't work as well because it was taking itself too damn seriously. The Beekeeper knows what it is and goes straight for it. Jason Statham talking about bee nonsense and protecting the hive was a hoot.I had a blast with it, and hope for a sequel. Probably objectively a 3 or 3.5 star film, but I'm awarding it an unironic 4 star for being so damn fun.","8/10"

As for the story line , the most preposterous part of this "" kill the bad guy"" tale, is that, a United States president has a conscience .

Agent Verona Parker maybe could have done without her. Didn't add much to the plot. The whole story line is a bit exaggerated with the POTUS being involved in the son's illicit gains. Don't think that was too smart of role selection. Would have rather seen a very high up CIA director involved in the scam, since they were using the software this scum was buying.

I highly recommend watching this movie, not to critique it but to sit back with your popcorn and enjoy over an hour of pure fun. Jason Stathan love him or hate him is one hard man in his movies. Jeremy Irons played a role almost identical to his role in Margin Call another of my favourites which was actually better than the big short. Go and enjoy a great movie..","10/10"
"The Beekeeper","saimariejohnson","7 February 2024","I thoroughly enjoyed the Beekeeper, and feel that the movie is incredibly relevant right now. With the rise of AI especially, the chances for schemes like the ones depicted in this film is quite valid and scary, but the idea that someone like Jason Statham just living his life in peace and trying to be a regular guy who is forced to the call of action via a horrible scenario that is deeply thought out and downright corrupt and wretch makes the movie suck you in and keep ahold to the very end. I think this is one everyone should see, especially as we see the increasing changes to life due to schematic fraud and those seeking to capitalize off innocent hardworking people in the most nefarious of ways.","9/10"
"The Beekeeper","julianmarku","25 January 2024","This movie starts like a John Wick movie and ends like Jason Statham movie.It has a lot of cool fight scenes and I have to say I like Jason Statham in this movie because the director isn't trying to make a complicated story.In fact I would say that the director subverts almost every John Wick-ism it can stumble on. And anyone who is a fan of John Wick can have a good laugh about it.I have to praise the casting for this movie. Everyone and I mean everyone does their jobs great.Everyone from Jason Statham to Jeremy Irons is so good but with a script too small that it has to speed through the story. For example, early in the movie you will meet a character played by British actor David Witts, he didn't play a very important role but his performance impressed me enough to look him up. (I couldn't even tell he was British). Great actor, with a great face, born in the wrong time.It honestly feels like the weakest part about the movie was the script. But at least it's very tight and quick, not like the 3 hour special theatrical releases these days. I can at least respect that. You can watch this movie and not need to check your phone for the time every 15 minutes.All in all. It's a great Jason Statham popcorn action movie. Just maybe don't watch it with friends that have some strong political opinions...","8/10"

People don't understand, the Beekeeper, shows the corruption of Big Tech, the Government, how they are tied together, to screw over citizens. The FBI are bumbling idiots, hired dumbies, who are poorly trained. I don't know if the writer and Stathom intentionally meant to show the real world through a fictional movie, but they did.Many poor reviews on here are probably from from people who were worried about the popularity of this movie and how others have connected it to corrupt politicians and corrupt companies.Hopefully well written movies, with good action & decent actors will continue down this path.

This story was clever though and the action scenes were top notch. I always laugh when I read reviews of a movie in this genre where people complain of it being ""over the top,"" and unrealistic. That is kinda the point!There was some weak acting on the part of others in the film. That could certainly have been improved. Admittedly I kind of winced whenever the lady and the guy FBI agents were on screen. Just the same, the move hits the mark for me. Good action scenes, and a unique, very unlikable, villain.","7/10"

"The Beekeeper","JohnDeSando","14 January 2024","""If a beekeeper says you're gonna die, you're gonna die."" Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons)When patrician bad boy, Oscar-winning Irons intones this threat/reality, you can figure The Beekeeper, Jason Statham's newest blood fest, may be a cut above his usual tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery. It is, lusty as his revenge motif is and metaphoric as the title wants to be.Retired federal operative, read ""assassin,"" called a ""Beekeeper,"" Adam Clay (Statham),--hear the metaphor start ringing-- witnesses the exploitation of an elderly friend, Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), by ruthless internet scammers, ending in her suicide. Director David Ayer and writer Kurt Wimmer not quite subtly weave the analogy of Clay ridding the hive (read society) of bad bees, even ones at the very top of the hive's government.I know, The beekeeper is just another example of revenge porn, but they have crafted an early try at literacy while keeping us fed on the nectar of ramming order into a chaotic political world such as our current presidential race fosters. While the script may offer too many ham-handed allusions to the figurative underpinnings, I found myself pleased by the attempt and remembering how the Bard eloquently incorporated the motif into one of his bloodiest and most romantic battle plays when he speaks of""the honeybees, / Creatures that by a rule in nature teach / The act of order to a peopled kingdom."" The Archbishop of Canterbury in Shakespeare's Henry V.Statham, 56 and feisty as ever, is as stone faced as ever, but the surprisingly effective setup with the death of his friend at the beginning casts a serious and almost literate overlay to otherwise transparently fabulous death actions that would otherwise be plain silly. Avenging the scammed elderly seems noble given how many of us have seen the sudden blinking warning that our system has been compromised and don't do anything but ""Call this number!"" If you're old and electronic averse, you're ready to be scammed.Stepping outside the usually-absurd carnage, The Beekeeper touches on such important societal blights as corrupt political campaign funding and malicious interference of family members with otherwise benign politicians. Although bad boys are as bad, if not worse, than any you have seen in these oft-cliched thrillers, this film tries to be more original, topical, and literate with both the good and the bad.Not bad for a Statham cliche.","8/10"

"The Beekeeper","TerrificTom","9 February 2024","I'm afraid too many people don't know what a genre movie is.It's a movie with a very specific audience in mind and it caters to that audience, almost to a fault. In a genre movie certain things MUST happen and certain things CAN'T happen! These are NOT up for negotiation. Think: EVERY Hallmark movie EVER made. Does the girl ever NOT get the guy? Is the guy EVER a Bad Boy or a Bad Boy by the end of the movie? NEVER. I'm not even sure Hallmark movies EVER have bad boys! I'm only familiar with Hallmark Christmas movies because that's what my mother had on 16hrs a day from Thanksgiving to Christmas and if we visited you couldn't escape them.Well, this is an Action Genre movie and it hits just about EVERY cliche it MUST hit to fit into that genre and the RING is satisfying! Maybe one or two were missed but I didn't notice. The ones that do hit are hit HARD bringing real satisfaction!I forget. Does HE die in the end? Cuz that can happen in a genre movie.Who cares? If he did they can always resurrect him for the sequel! It happens in genre movies all the time. Why? Because when an audience decides it LIKES the hero, they want to see him again. And again. And again, etc., etc., ad infinitum! Genre movies and genre books are NOT ""literature."" There are no unwelcome or unwanted surprises in a genre story, UNLESS they are reversed before the final curtain.The challenge this puts on the writer and director is massive. They must find a way, against all odds, to make something unoriginal and formulaic LOOK original and innovative, without really originating or innovating anything. Now I admit, all of this sounds bad to the over-educated and highbrow among us - genre movies are what Martin Scorsese was talking about when he ripped on the MCU - but it doesn't have to be bad at all. If it can be done WELL. Hundreds of millions of people LOVE genre stories. Writers, producers, and directors have made untolded BILLIONS of dollars from them. Because when they succeed at the impossible, the millions and millions of action genre fans will reward them with word-of-mouth advertising and their film will make MONEY. Sometimes a LOT of money!I said all that so that if you identify as a fan of the action genre, this movie is definitely worth your time. But then, if you are a real action genre fan, you already intend to go see it!So go. Because you will enjoy it as much as I did.","10/10"

The movie has some plot stretches but for a movie that adapts the equalizer concept I wouldn't be surprised about a man that can take down the whole SWAT team on his own specially that's the whole point behind the story itself. The dedication of ""bees"" that mainly makes them a very essential part of our environment . The movie as a whole package is very good and was fun to watch and wouldn't hate to see a sequel to it , don't mind the haters that went into a Jason Statham movie expecting to watch Macbeth play's performance!

"The Beekeeper","dakwamyth-61293","12 February 2024","I like the attack on these scramming companies, and this movie dose just that. The law has failed to control these companies. And politicians use them. I think the only weak point here, is that the President claimed in Privet she did not know. In fact a Politician likely would have known, and worked to protect them.But anyhow, the story was very well done, and enjoyable to watch. Excellent cast and crew, that put this together very well. Statham did a wonderful job with his character, as well as the others. The woman that played the Daughter and FBI agent, did very good on her complex view on things. You kind of expected the ending, because it was the way most movies are done. But she kept you wondering which way she would go, with as few signs as possible.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","arungeorge13","30 January 2024","The Beekeeper really is one of those Statham action vehicles where you can laugh at the atrocity of the plot (and its developments) and just tag along for the undemanding ride. Yes, it does feel like a John Wick ripoff staged a bit differently, though director David Ayer knows how to play to Statham's strengths. He's once again a one-man-wrecking-machine, and Ayer exploits that by effectively stylizing the action blocks. Whenever Statham's off-screen, the screenplay (by Kurt Wimmer) carries a made-for-TV feel to it, with random and uninteresting banter between FBI officers. There are bee metaphors galore, and for what it's worth, the entirety of the last act is driven by one of them.Ayer reunites with his Street Kings colleague in DP Gabriel Beristain, who brings in a sense of slickness to the wider, more elaborate shots while also neatly balancing it out in the closer hand-to-hand combat sequences. I think Ayer realised early on that the script didn't offer anything new to engage the audiences, so he decided to keep things as delightfully campy as possible. As a result, we also gets a few moments of dark humour amidst the strictly R-rated action. Josh Hutcherson seems to have had a great time playing the antagonist (a swindling, fintech nepokid), and while he's never a physical match for Statham, the chase remains wholly watchable. For a January release, I guess this did alright.","10/10"
"The Beekeeper","ryanculp-95641","12 January 2024","I don't understand those saying the plot is weak, if you have any relatives who have been scammed or know about call centers and scammers you would know they are a prevalent problem in real life and now in this movie.The only person who ever cared for him was scammed of their life savings and the charity that they ran causing them to kill themselves over making such a mistake and losing everything. Therefore leading Jason on a rampage to go through call centers and make his way up to the top of the ""beehive"" and shut the hole operation down.The action in this movie was spectacular. There were some gruesome scenes at some points with fingers being chopped off, soldiers being hung from ceilings, the camera shots were low and moving so you could see blood splatter when enemies were shot in the head. Overall, the action in this film from gun combat and hand to hand combat is phenomenal and on par with John Wick.Rating: 10/10.","9/10"
"The Beekeeper","healingtoolbox","16 January 2024","The Beekeeper's theme and moral ambition is a thousand per-cent clearer than 2016's Suicide Squad. Many of the same themes here, all much more clear-cut. This gives Japan Stratham strong moral momentum which wasn't possible in Squad. Perhaps the best Jason movie since Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw?This is a movie where you can and you do cheer when the bad guys get their just desserts. The audience I saw it with cheered out loud at the end. Since the 1980s, screenwriters have mostly beat up on international drug cartel lords.The Beekeeper suggests a better target. Beat up on internet hackers who prey on the public, amoral Tech Bros and anyone higher, whose allegiances are not ""for the good of the hive,"" translation: for the highest good of the 99% of working families, not just for elite interests.Jeremy Irons provides a valuable counterpoint to Jason. Jeremy is the older voice of reason; yet also, of the olf elite status quo. Jeremy is not the main villain. He represents the older generation who enable younger villains because it pays well.I especially liked how the motivations driving five or six supporting characters were fleshed out; and, how their varied motivators came into conflict. This made all the characters more believable.I'm ready for Beekeeper #2.","5/10"

Which is what you want sometimes don't get me wrong!Here Mr. S. plays a retired U. S. Government secret service operative, Adam Clay who who looks after bees (hence the name of the film) in his spare time in between knocking two bells of **** out of people who upset him along the way. It later transpires that Clay was a member of a unit called The Beekepers.In this film, the target of the Beekeeper's anger is phishing criminals who clear out people's savings. In one such case, the criminals exploit the retired schoolteacher who The Beekeper is renting a garage off for his Beekeeping activities.

The plot is atrocious, the dialog is bad and the acting is some of the worst I've sat through in a long while. Jason was still Jason, but the rest? Bad.The portrayal of government agencies and agents was laughable. Tell your boss at the FBI Jason the Beekeeper is chasing down bad guys, and within 15 seconds he's heard enough and you get a blank check. Show up at POTUS' retreat, introduce yourself as an agent with the ""Federal Bureau of something or other"" and get waved through. Uh huh.Jason the Beekeeper was able to mow through thugs, Police Officers, SWAT officers, FBI Agents, SEALS, Delta, etc with no difficulty, not even a scratch.

This movie makes REACHER look gentle, sophisticated and subtle. The silliness of this movie is enjoyable. We're talking 80s dumbness with a bit of Luc Besson's movie's shiny look and stupidity. This is a violent comedy vaguely inspired by John Wick but happy with being fun and crazy with some bad CGI explosions.Of course you have the diversity female part as the badass cop to side with our invincible white hero. Jason Statham is half Bruce Willis half video game meathead and the less he talks the more he's in character. Josh Hutcherson looks like Jack Harlow if he was in Duran Duran.

"The Beekeeper","roaldknol","1 March 2024","I'm normally a fan of action movies, and I like many of the roles Jason Statham has played in the past. I think he might have been able to carry the plot, if it wasn't for the incredibly poor writing and the poor acting of the rest of the cast. The woman who played the female FBI agent wasn't in the slightest way alive or engaging. The drugged up crypto boy presidential son could have gotten away with his total lack of emotional depth if he wasn't the main protagonist.The idea of the movie could have resulted in a decent action flick. ""Ex killer agent goes after the president's scumbag son and kills his way through hordes of special forces to even the score of a sweetheart grandma being wronged."". It's a good premise for an action movie. How mindless and helpless the bad guys who are going after the main character behave, could have been excused as a plot device. They're just random thugs after all. However, the way the FBI, a group of ex navy seals and Delta force operators, as well as the secret service, are hopelessly and helplessly flailing about as some sort of ""John Wick light"" effortlessly wanders through hordes of them, massacring them left and right is not in the furthest believable.That's not even the worst part of the movie tho. I have a request for whoever came up with the idea that the secret service would allow the president's son to throw a party at a beach front property with a hundred or so guests with mommy president there as well, while a group of south African mercenaries are supposed to deal with the threat of a guy who just rampaged the entirety of the nation's finest special forces operators to get to that same president's son: Please don't ever write a movie script again.","7/10"

This is a great movie that's loud, exciting, over-the-top, and fun! It delves deep into the action genre and delivers exactly what you'd hope for from a Jason Statham film. The fight choreography is top-notch, and the stunts are heart-stopping. However, while Statham shines, some of the supporting characters feel poorly written and their performances fall flat, which can be distracting. Nonetheless, if you're in the mood for adrenaline-pumping entertainment, this movie delivers in spades. Watch it for a quick brainless fun time with not much expectations, and you'll enjoy it.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","SnoopyStyle","2 February 2024","Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is the beekeeper. Secretly, he's a retired super-assassin from an unrestricted government program. His friend Eloise Parker gets taken by a call center scam team and commits suicide. He decides to track down and take out the entire organization. He is pursued by Eloise's daughter FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman). The scam organization is led by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson) and protected by former CIA director Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons).This is like a less serious Death Wish or lesser John Wick. Statham is doing Statham. It would be better to have Verona join Adam Clay in a buddy action thriller. I get the idea of uncovering the program and choosing the morality of the situation. She feels underused when her character starts so strongly. This is slight fun. It had the potential to start another action thriller franchise, but that's unlikely now.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","alindsayal","26 January 2024","Over the years, Jason Statham has been a part of plenty of action films which have differentiated in quality. We have another one with The Beekeeper and I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after someone close to him is robbed and killed, a Beekeeper goes on a revenge mission showcasing his former skills.Main Character
As mentioned above, Statham has played the lead role in an action film many times and he does a great job here, it feels like he can play this role in his sleep. It isn't the toughest role he has ever taken on but it just works and he adds some legitimacy for this role and it is fun to see him play a Beekeeper.Supporting Characters
Josh Hutcherson plays an annoying bad guy here and it took a while but I liked his performance here. He is just so arrogant and annoying that you really want to see him get taken down and this made me root for Statham even more in this film.Jeremy Irons plays the head of the company that Statham is after. He again is good in the role and is charisma is on full display here. It is probably one of the easiest pay checks that he has ever got but he is clearly enjoying the role.Emmy Raver-Lampman plays a cop and I didn't really care for her performance. She is a bit over the top and her character just makes some strange decisions and it is kind of convoluting as to why she does certain things in the film.Bobby Naderi plays her partner and he is also cheesy and really over the top. The two of them have decent chemistry but for me it doesn't really work in this film.Story
The story is pretty basic here and focuses on this guys revenge mission and in that it is pretty cool and exciting seeing Statham's character go after the people that have wronged him and the people he knows. There is also a pretty cool twist towards the end of the film that made things way more interesting. But some of the others character motivations are pretty strange and the overall explanation for Statham's training doesn't work with other things that happen in the film. Worse of all is the really abrupt ending of the film that doesn't really answer any questions and feels really out of place.Script
This is where the film really falls flat and that is the writing. This film has some real cringe worthy dialogue here, especially when it comes to the bee metaphors. But it is like the film doesn't have an ending and like the writers weren't sure what to do.Style
The film has some really great action sequences. The majority of people are just here to see Jason Statham beat up and kill people and you get that here in spades and it is easily the highlight of the film. The film also has pretty good pacing, it doesn't overstay its welcome and I thought moved pretty well.Overall
Overall, The Beekeeper is an above average action film. Statham is great and the action is fun to watch but it is exactly what you would expect. This is probably one to watch when it comes to streaming at home instead of rushing to the cinema to watch it.Rating - 6/10.","1/10"
"The Beekeeper","ptnptxrj","13 February 2024","The scenario of the movie is very bad, it seems like it written by someone who worked for bollywood before, it's so bad, i was waiting for jason statham to dance on the bollywood style in a part of the movie with other bad characters and sing an indian song, even a 7 years old kid wouldn't buy such a scenario,they was trying to copy the idea of john wick somehow and in very bad way, the characters excluding jason all bad especially verona,i bet if it was a beekeeping farm movie with a better scenario would create a much intersting movie,if you want to waste your time watch it............","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","FixedYourEnding","9 February 2024","The Beekeeper is a typical Jason Statham action movie, with lots of fights, explosions, and cheesy one-liners. Statham plays a former assassin who goes on a revenge spree against a corrupt tech company that ruined the life of a friend. The plot is thin, the dialogue is bad, and the villains are cartoonish and forgettable, the movie is ridiculous, over-the-top and even offensive at times, but... I totally enjoyed it.The revenge on the bad actors in this film (no pun intended) is really fun and rewarding, it is like all the people you wished you could do that to got the revenge in the way the deserve. Statham is doing his usual job in inflicting pain on everybody that stands in his way, the pacing in the movie is great and there is never a dull moment. Statham is the action, everything else is a 2nd fiddle in his symphony, including the supporting actors, are all there to be props in his quest.And yes, don't try to make sense of the story while watching this, it will ruin the movie for you. This is a beer (or coke) and popcorn movie start to finish. The tech part in the movie, as well as all the government conspiracies, although based on real occurrences is completely blown out of proportion but still a lesson to be had. The bees knew what they were doing.Grab a box of popcorn and enjoy this action flick! Exact score: 68 / 100.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","CANpatbuck3664","26 January 2024","The reviews I've seen for The Beekeeper laud it for being ""straightforward fun"" and ""an enjoyable throwback."" The underlying message is that The Beekeeper is enjoyable if you can appreciate it for the genre thrills. Now that I've seen it, you're going to get what you want from the action. Bones are broken, bullets go flying and the bad guys are punished for their misdeeds in a satisfying and well utilized manner. I actually think the team behind the camera deserves a lot of credit for this. David Ayer gets a bad rap for a couple of lacklustre movies sprinkled in with a few great ones (including one that's in the pantheon of my all time favourites, EoW) but his direction here is at least a level above from what you typically get in this style of movie. The Beekeeper boasts Ayer's famous gritty feel and this also accents the fight scenes. But I also think the movie looks really good between the cinematography and being cut together really well so I want to credit Director of Photography Gabriel Beristain and Editor Geoffrey O'Brien for helping The Beekeeper punch above it's weight class.I've already admitted to being a big fan of David Ayer but I'm also a longtime defender of Jason Statham. He's one of the few leading men with the chops and screen presence to lead an action movie in our modern cinematic environment (without putting on a superhero costume). He's a decent actor but more importantly, he's also secretly hilarious when given the opportunity (if you get a chance, check out his turn as Rick Ford in Spy, he's phenomenal in that movie). I was excited that he was getting another potential franchise to lead but while he's certainly bringing his physicality to Adam Clay, there's a complete absence of his charm. He mostly grunts his way through the proceedings and his character felt like a rehash and the type of role he was parodying with his appearance in Spy. There's some really talented names in the supporting cast as well and I thought many of them shone through some so-so material. Jeremy Irons brings his gravitas to the character of Wallace Westwyld. He's relatively grounded compared to some big performances from his cast mates and I enjoyed his measured take. I've always really liked Emmy Raver-Lampan in the Umbrella Academy and I think she's the overall standout in The Beekeeper. She's very serious in her early appearances (to the desired effect) but I liked her even better when she's cracking wise and trading buddy-cop barbs with her on-screen partner played by Bobby Naderi. She's definitely got one of the more fleshed out characters but she's got range and hopefully her work here will lead to more roles in movies. To my pleasant surprise, my other favourite performance was Josh Hutcherson as the unbelievably slimy Derek Danforth. This might not seem like a compliment as he's playing such a detestable character but I thought he was appropriately smarmy and unlikeable without chewing on the scenery (e.g. The admittedly fun but hammy job done by David Witts). I wouldn't have imagined Josh playing a villain but he exceeded my expectations in this role and he deserves kudos.I've mentioned the acting, the film making and the action but I have to get to the elephant in the room now. The script for The Beekeeper was shockingly inept and I kept wondering how it was greenlit in this condition? Travesty is a little dramatic but Holy Underwritten Plot & Characters Batman! Admittedly, some movies walk a fine line in tonality but not everything has to be deadly serious. There's also such things as enjoyably cheesy or deliberately hammy. I had some trouble deciding if that's what The Beekeeper is aiming for. The action scenes are unflinchingly savage and the film has a mostly-serious rhythm (the all-too-real scams, the political intrigue and government bureaucracy don't seem satirical) but then there's the tongue in cheek joking, the one-liners, the knockoff Wolf of Wall Street bravado from the villains, the constant talking about literal and metaphorical bees and over-the-top elements (a rival beekeeper whipping out a mini-gun at a crowded gas station kind of decision) that suggest it's a secret/surprise comedy. Are the filmmakers being deliberately silly? Are they in on the joke? Is The Beekeeper laughing with the audience or just missing the mark with unintentional comedic results? I couldn't really get a firm grasp on the desired tempo here but the conclusion I arrived at was that the film was serious and that the story and the script missed it's mark. The Beekeeper reminded me a little of the movie Skyscraper when it would careen into silliness. There's no doubt that parts of this movie were designed to be funny but I wasn't just laughing at those deliberate choices and I don't think that was what the creative team had in mind.I really tried to meet The Beekeeper on every level. My combined love of both David Ayer's and Jason Statham's work, an appreciation of straight-to-the-point action the movie boasts and a cast that showed up to work (extra credit to Emmy Raver-Lampman and Josh Hutcherson). I kept hoping for a gradual turnaround, a twist that would shift the narrative from bouncing between solid action to some disappointingly goofy dialogue and storytelling, or an ending that would ratchet up the proceedings. But it wasn't in the cards and while I don't disagree that The Beekeeper is a serviceable vehicle for some satisfying Statham punching & kicking but this movie could have been a lot better. I saw this with a friend in an empty theatre and we were laughing, rolling our eyes and cracking jokes throughout. I would actually like to give this team another crack at it if everyone was able to return (except Kurt Wimmer, he can just stay home). There's a lot of talent assembled here, I just think they hit a ground rule double instead of a home run. Check The Beekeeper out if you're a fan of Jason Statham or if you can tune out your inner critic and just enjoy the action.","5/10"
"The Beekeeper","ethanbresnett","13 January 2024","The Beekeeper is a relatively unambitious film that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or push the boat out too much. It all feels very derivative of the genre with no element of it particularly standing out.If you manage to wade through the tiresome bee metaphors, the clunky cliche dialogue, and Jason Statham's sporadic attempt at an American accent, there are some entertaining action set pieces to get stuck into.I do also think that the plot is perfectly decent. Nothing special but it moves along at a decent pace even if it is entirely ridiculous.Overall the Beekeeper is far from being a great, or even really a good film. But on the plus side it's not god awful. It's one of those films that has a time and a place, so if you are in the mood for some mindless action it will scratch that itch for you.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","ferguson-6","9 February 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. For those who take pride in their ability to keep track of body counts in movies, I can only say, best of luck with this one. Boom. Bang. Punch. Kick. Stab. Choke. Flip. Our hero, acting alone, uses every available attack to neutralize armies, SWAT teams, trained security teams, and greedy scumbags ... all in the name of ""protecting the hive"". OK, it's mostly for revenge for causing the death of ""the only person who took care of me.""
Director David Ayer (END OF WATCH 2012, SUICIDE SQUAD 2016) and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (SALT, 2010) are very much at home in the action-violence genre, and adding the king of cinematic hand-to-hand combat, Jason Statham, to the mix can only mean more action and more fighting and more violence. There is no reason to critique a movie that delivers exactly what it sets out to deliver to an audience that expects exactly that.Statham is in prime form as Adam Clay, a beekeeper on a farm owned by retired teacher Elise Parker (Phylicia Rashad, CREED). When a phishing scam drains her bank accounts, including that of the non-profit she administers, Clay reacts to the subsequent tragedy by tracking down the culprits of the scheme. Tech fraudsters are easy targets because we all despise them, and the film plays that up by exaggerating the obnoxious nature of those involved. A miscast Josh Hutcherson (THE HUNGER GAMES) plays Derek Danforth, an entitled little bleep who skateboards in the office to his next massage and wears outlandish outfits befitting a person desperate for attention. Adding to the psychological drama is FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman, ""The Umbrella Academy""), the daughter of Elise, the woman who put Clay on his mission of reckoning.Additional supporting roles include Bobby Naderi as Verona's FBI partner, Jemma Redgrave as the President, a brief appearance by Minnie Driver as the FBI director (she takes three quick phone calls), and Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Wallace Westwyld, the retired agent charged with keeping Derek safe. The hook here is that beekeeper Clay is actually a retired secret agent known as ""the Beekeeper"", and in one of the oddest sequences, his replacement (a wild character inspired by Prince?) brings a Gatling gun to try and end Clay once and for all. The film is silly and absurd, and right up the alley of those who embrace Statham's stoic bulldozer of a man.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","CinemaSerf","16 January 2024","""Clay"" (Jason Statham) has worked for an off-the-books US government programme designed to provide the ultimate security to the democratic process by providing unlimited training and resources to a group of people whose job it is is to objectively protect the system. These folks are called ""beekeepers"" which is lucky because our Jason has decided to spend his well earned retirement doing precisely that. He rents some space in the barn of ""Eloise"" (Phylicia Rashad) and one evening she invites him round for supper. He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter ""Verona"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. ""Clay"" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with ""Clay"" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.","8/10"

"The Beekeeper","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","26 February 2024","A vigilante takes revenge for his sweet neighbor.This kind of cowboy action movie has largely kept up with what your average movie goer is most upset about, and now the target is the phishing scammer, a group of people that we all agree are truly despicable, and thus there is great catharsis in seeing them brutalized.They even get a chance, and many are allowed to go as long as they solemnly swear not to do it again(!). The movie goes to great lengths to make them as utterly despicable as at all possible. It really lays it on thick; it's honestly rather patronizing, but I'd be a bold-faced liar if I claimed for a single second that it doesn't 100% work.The villains are unbelievably awful people, and we love to hate them. I will never be able to unsee Josh Hutcherson as Mark Zuckerberg by way of Logan Paul refashioned into a Donald Trump son, literally stealing retired people's pensions and showing zero remorse. Honestly, I never thought the endless stream of charisma and boyish charm who portrayed Peeta Mellark had this in him, but he looks like he is having the time of his life playing it... and so was I, watching it.Without a doubt, this is a live-action cartoon. There is nothing about it that feels quite like it belongs in the real world, despite the gritty stylization. The plentiful and nicely spread out action looks incredibly cool. It is not tense outside of one brief bit; this is of course what we expect from writer Kurt Wimmer, and director David Ayer, true to form, stages it beautifully. 7/10.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","appusnikhil","4 February 2024","As usual, it was a weekend and I needed something satisfying to boost my day. There comes Beekeeper. As usual, It's a complete Jason Statham show and David Ayer has gone a bit far in the story by creating a list of exuberant antagonists who will never match the 'Beekeeper's' charisma.The movie was 100 percent satisfying. Well, you shouldn't question the story. Someone new to Jason's movie will be surprised by the massive stuff one man does against an entire army.This is a complete Jason show and he has nailed the role he got. The production design was also great. I do enjoy movies like this where we are completely submerged in the action bit and give no notice to the story or screenplay.","5/10"
"The Beekeeper","Pjtaylor-96-138044","18 March 2024","Although it's arguably better than it has any right to bee, David Ayer's 'The Beekeeper (2024)' still sits in that odd category of movies that are relatively enjoyable but undeniably total trash. The surprisingly good action, as unexpectedly exciting and gleefully brutal as it may bee, isn't good enough to fully offset the surprisingly bad everything else, and neither are the litany of A-list one-step-above-cameos (even though the performers all totally understand the assignment and wouldn't be out of place in a much better version of this). The set-pieces, including an effectively crunchy 'final boss' battle and some delightfully 'Hitman'-esque stealth sequences, are genuinely well-made and equally as entertaining. The choreography is sharp, the framing is clean and Jason Statham's physical presence is entirely believable (there are no obvious stunt doubles, for instance). There's also a nice mix of different types of action, and the bluntly brutal (yet knowingly absurd) nature of the kills somehow always manages to catch you off guard. However, the narrative is just total nonsense. While the film clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and is purposefully light on authenticity so as to be all the more breezy, it doesn't quite hit the register it needs to in order to classify as - for lack of a better term - turn-your-brain-off fun. There are several scenes which are just... boring, particularly those that saddle us with bland FBI side characters investigating events we've either already seen or pieced together. There is something to be said about the way in which the flick often presents its hero (or antihero, because he's a total maniac) as a villain, having him tear into scenes we often view from the perspective of the actual baddies and cause utter chaos before he leaves the picture to relentlessly stalk his prey off screen and the FBI are left to pick up the pieces, but even this is a double-edged sword because it means that the eponymous killer simply isn't in the film as much as he should bee. For a long time, the experience is straight-up bad. Then, Jason Statham starts beating the snot out of call centre workers and the movie settles into its strange rhythm of enjoyable action followed by dull non-action followed by enjoyable action and so on. The fact that the in-between stuff is obviously filler is a major red flag. One of the movie's most obvious comparisons is, of course, 'John Wick (2014)' and its sequels, but that series only works as well does because of its in-between stuff. Basically, the better version of this feature is more than a collection of action scenes strung along by a weak narrative. Ultimately, this isn't a terrible effort. It would be a lot worse if its action wasn't as good as it is, but it would bee a lot better if its action wasn't the only thing that's good about it. It'd bee enough even if the non-action was just mediocre, rather than bad, because the action is strong enough to elevate a mediocre movie fairy significantly, even though it's not strong enough to elevate a bad movie to the same degree. It's entirely watchable even in its current state, though, and it's breezy enough to bee worth a go if it sounds like something you'd like.","9/10"

"The Beekeeper","aleksovski92","17 January 2024","Okay, let's get this out the hive right away: The Beekeeper didn't sting me the way I hoped. Jason Statham as a vengeance-fueled ex-spy? That's usually my honey pot. But this particular batch left me feeling a bit... sticky.First off, the visuals. The cinematography felt uninspired, lacking the crispness and dynamism that could have elevated the action sequences. And while the explosions delivered a certain boom, they lacked the visceral punch that truly immerses you in the scene.Speaking of Statham, he's the undeniable highlight. Dude throws punches with raw intensity, and his signature grit shines through every scene. But even Statham can't fully salvage the plot. The twists were predictable, and the supporting cast's motivations felt underdeveloped, leaving them mostly as one-dimensional action fodder.The saving grace, however, is the action itself. Statham commits to every fight, delivering brutal choreography that's undeniably entertaining, even if the CGI occasionally falters. It's like they poured all their budget into Statham's stunt doubles and said, ""Meh, the rest can be pixelated bees, who cares?""So, should you check out The Beekeeper? Well, if you're a die-hard Statham fan and crave mindless action, then maybe. Just set your expectations for a B-movie experience with predictable twists and underwhelming visuals. Otherwise, you might be better off buzzing over to something else. This hive ain't worth the sting.","3/10"
"The Beekeeper","matthewheneghan","4 February 2024","This film grapples with self identity originating from its initial frame. In the opening sequences of the movie the pacing attempts to have you believe that this film will be a broody Statham slaughter extravaganza, in line with others of his repertoire.However, the film soon falls victim to juvenile expositions and shallow, one dimensional characters. Perhaps the worst of them being a brash, young FBI agent Verona Parker. Each time she was featured on screen I couldn't help but feel that the dialogue was penned by high-school students working on a group project.The action sequences are passable, yet nothing inspired or memorable.Overall this movie fails to live up to its fun, adrenaline fuelled thrill-ride its marketed to be.The beekeeper fails to deliver any sweet nuance of action packed fun.

"The Beekeeper","SAMTHEBESTEST","17 January 2024","The Beekeeper (2024) :
Movie Review :David Ayer directs Jason Statham in an action-packed drama, The Beekeeper. This title has a sweet meaning, but I dare you call this film or the Beekeeper's character sweet. That's sour and spicy, for sure. Jason Statham has done popular action films like Transporter, The Italian Job (a thriller), The Mechanic, The Expendables, and Fast & Furious movies, but has struggled a bit in the recent past. The Beekeeper is an answer to that struggle, maybe. We all know plenty of kick assss action movies, but John Wick has that universal recognition like no other film when it comes to the pure, mad action genre in this millenium. The Beekeeper might just be that John Wick kind of chapter in Jason's book. This is not an exaggeration, but a comparative statement, and don't misread ""might be"" as ""is"". It's an arguable statement to avoid direct comparisons and fan wars.Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), a retired schoolteacher who has never done a bad thing in her life and has devoted her time to charity, is scammed by a huge online racket. Devasted, she commits suicide. Adam Clay (Jason Statham), a beekeeper working at a garage, shared a good bond with her. Eloise's daughter, Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman), is an FBI agent, and she arrests Adam for his mother's death. Soon, the investigation reveals that it was a suicide, and then Clay is released. Verona informs Clay that the group that scammed her mother has been on the FBI's radar for some time but is difficult to track. Adam then takes his own path to find the gang and runs mad on a murder spree. His last target is Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), who tries his best to stop him, but he is unaware of what a beekeeper means and how dangerous he is. I don't think I should give away any spoilers on Beekeeper's identity and work and how he takes on the entire gang alone, so let's keep that part fresh for your viewing experience.Kurt Wimmer writes a basic revenge drama, and the screenplay adds some thrilling and brutal moments. Each time the Beekeeper is out hunting, he stings, and he stings sharply and on the right spot. Some nerve-breaking killing moments will have your eyes filled with blood, and there will be a lot of blood in front of your eyes as well. The Beekeeper has some insanely ridiculous theories about its main character and his features that look ridiculously unbelievable, but also ridiculously entertaining. I mean, let's say you want a hero who can beat anybody to pulp, can burn down any place, can breach security even at the president's party hall, and then come out of everything without a scratch. Wouldn't you freaking love him and scream for him? Kurt Wimmer has written Adam Clay, aka The Beekeeper, with all those features. The only problem with his writing is that it follows all those traditional packages you've been served for years. Predictability is not good for any film, unless it's a known/true story.Let's talk about Statham Man. He is a killer-a real one, I mean. Hobbs and Shaw showed his calibre and why he deserves to be one of the leading action stars in the F&F franchise, but sadly, the makers are too busy with others even after 10 movies. This man deserves a solo action movie like The Beekeeper to prove his talent. He scares hell out of everyone in movie, be it antagonists, cops, or even the bigger players in this game. Emmy Raver-Lampman gets a few good scenes, but even those aren't healthy ones. Josh Hutcherson is your rich, spoiled brat and, as expected, a greedy man and a drug addict. What more can you expect from him? Jeremy Irons plays the interesting character of Wallace, which I think had more scope but is cut short because he didn't really enter the game of blood. Phylicia Rashad and Jemma Redgrave's support is really helpful.The Beekeeper is a wacky action flick with superb action choreography. Geoffrey O'Brien's editing keeps it short and quick, with a gripping runtime of 100 minutes excluding credits. You'll see some decent framework by Gabriel Beristain that could have done better, especially the creative part of long action set pieces. The film has a few loopholes that should have been covered with some emotional quotient, but what's done is done now. The sound design and production design have been okay. It's good to see the man who made the first installment of the Fast & Furious franchise come up with such a violent flick that isn't about logic but is hardly illogical as far as a crowd-pleasing experience is concerned. Nevertheless, he delivers a worthy action drama for the devotees of the genre and devotees of Jason Statham. That retrograded ambition from 2001 could have been avoided, or, better yet, this film could have been made much earlier to have a better impact. But it's not that corny anyway.

"The Beekeeper","latinfineart","16 January 2024","The film started out quite well and the very first action scene was excellent, though it was a bit of an exaggeration, however with a fairly minor leap of faith it was somewhat believable. From there it just went downhill, there was that Hollywood tendency to over blow everything and to stretch every premise to the absolute limit of implausibility, which just gets old after a while. You just you want to see some good action, you want to see a good story and you don't want to see a story stretched to the absolute end of what is physically possible in the known universe. However, if you like Marvel type films, silly stories made for kids, or cartoons, you will likely enjoy this drivel.After about 45 minutes, the film got very tiresome. I also thought the female FBI agent (Lampman) was very poorly miscast, and written, and the South African bad guy was just a ridiculous cartoon.It could have been a decent movie but it wasn't.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","southdavid","24 January 2024","I'm not the world biggest fan of this sort of midbudget action film, the ones that seem to end up on the streaming services rather than the big screen these days and whilst ""The Beekeeper"" isn't great it's unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and some decent turns in the support cast elevate it slightly above those.When his landlady Eloise (Phylicia Rashad) takes her own life, after her life savings are stolen from her by a cybercrime syndicate, Adam Clay (Jason Statham) sets out to avenge her. Clay though is not just an ordinary vigilante, he was once a Beekeeper, a member of a special government project, highly trained and given autonomy to make his own decisions about how to progress a situation. As Clay kills his way up the foodchain, chased by Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman), Clay comes to learn that the syndicate have ties to government agencies, that have the resources to mount a defence against his onslaught.So, all of the good work in this is done by supporting characters, particularly Raver-Lampman, so good in ""The Umbrella Academy"", and her partner in this, played by Bobby Naderi. Their scenes together elevate the film somewhat. Josh Hutchison is having a good time too, as a higher up douchebag who believes, and with some reason, that he's untouchable. One of the problems though is that Statham's character is pretty lifeless. He's proved in other films he's capable of being charismatic but here he just waffles on about Bees every chance he gets, which becomes hilarious the further you get into the film and the more frequently it happens. You can only mumble ""Protect the Hive"" so many times, before it ceases to lose all meaning.The action is fine, if perhaps lacking something truly interesting or memorable. The CGI work isn't as good as the practical stunts, and the fighting remains a touch below something like a ""John Wick"". If briefly threatens to accept its dumb nature, during a fight with another Beekeeper and become more fun, but doesn't commit to it for long.There's probably a desire to franchise the character, like has happened with other Statham films, but I really don't think there's much more meat on what was already a modest bone.","1/10"
"The Beekeeper","akatsha","19 February 2024","If there is an Oscar for the worst movie, this one will slam every single category. It will go down the history as the worst way to waste money and resources. Every thing was handled superficially starting from the second of his arrest all the way until he disappeared under water. Every one in the movie seemed stupid except the single man hero who takes things in his own hands. There wasn't even an attempt to make this movie legit in any thing. The beekeeper that was supposed to replace him, so dumb. The Asian FBI agent, so dumb. The African American deputy director, so dumb. Matt, the FBI agent, so dumb. And so on, every character that came to play was dumb and not white. Except the beekeeper who is angry white man who wants to correct things his way.","8/10"

"The Beekeeper","bristolbluebear","2 March 2024","From the guy who brought us Fury, Training Day and End of Watch! What was he thinking? This movie has no script, pace, story or direction. The bad guys were clich√©d and the plot was wanting. This is an hour and 45 I'm not getting back unfortunately. Statham is looking a little tired these days. As always, he beats people up and clumsily infiltrates highly secured areas without a clue. The dialogue is clunky and characters pretty forgettable. Please give this a swerve if you value your sanity. I do hope this is the one and only movie in this storyline and David has a long hard look at himself. So so poor.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","stevencayer","22 January 2024","To be, or not to be? THE BEEKEEPER is a movie that has Jason Statham in it. There, if you know Jason Statham, I've given you all the knowledge you need for this movie and you can stop reading now. For those of you who might need a little more information, the rest is for you. This is an action movie that is the most accurate depiction of ""It's so bad it's good"". It's about Adam Clay (Jason Statham), who is retired from his job and is now beekeeping for Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), who is letting him stay in the barn. Eloise gets targeted by a phishing scam that robs all of her money. After tragedy strikes, Adam goes on a revenge rampage following the money trail, using his specific set of skills as a ""beekeeper"". It's very rare when I can safely say that I loved and hated this experience. The script is horrible, but hilarious. The antagonists are cartoony, but hilarious. The violent action is great. The non-stop bee puns are fantastic, but not for everyone. The supporting cast is actually good, involving a unique role for Josh Hutcherson, Jeremy Irons, even Minnie Driver for some reason. I enjoyed how similar it is to JOHN WICK. He's just trying to ""protect the hive"". Phishing scams are still very prevalent in today's society, and this movie is a reminder to always be careful online, unless you're friends with Jason Statham. He had a bad year last year with THE MEG 2 and THE EXPENDABLES 4, but this is definitely his niche. We just need to not take his movies seriously. If you see THE BEEKEEPER, just shut down your brain for a couple hours and enjoy the ride. I highly recommend this!","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","eugabrieldacosta","19 January 2024","The movie, at times, loses itself in secondary plots, diverting us from what truly matters - the action led by the hero. This leaves us eager for the central character's return.Though the story echoes films like John Wick, it fails to capture the same striking essence. It resides in predictability, unable to secure a place in cinematic memory.The action scenes are good but not exceptional. The actors shine in fights, yet the excitement falls short of expectations.Overall, it's an action film that oscillates between captivating and monotonous moments. The first act is promising, the second disappoints, while the third redeems some of the lost brilliance.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","eddie_baggins","18 February 2024","Let's be clear, if you don't go along with The Beekeeper chances are you're going to have a horrible time with a b-movie (or is that bee-movie?) that is both unashamed and unafraid of what it is from the moment it begins until the moment it ends but if you're willing to go along for the ride in this John Wick-lite actioner there's a very decent chance you're going to have an absolute blast.Likely to remain one of 2024's most surprising success stories, both with an unexpectedly decent critical reception and also a box office haul in excess of over $100 million worldwide (spawning what is likely to be a sequel in the near future), The Beekeeper is a return to form for both its director David Ayer and its main man Jason Statham who here both showcase their limited strengths to great effect, to gift us an old school action/vigilante experience that just so happens to love the odd bee quip or fact.Wasting little time getting to the crux of its tale centred around Statham's man of little words Adam Clay going on a bloodthirsty quest for justice against a corporation of greedy scammers that are overseen by Josh Hutcherson's detestable and scenery chewing Derek Danforth, The Beekeeper is as unbelievable and comical as the most over the top moments of any John Wick or Fast and the Furious offering but there's a glee and carefree nature to this tale that can't be denied, forcing one to pass over their sensibilities or better judgement and just go along for the carnage filled rides.From screenwriter and mastermind behind the Point Break and Total Recall remakes Kurt Wimmer's ham-tastic screenplay (""When someone hurts an older person, they are often left to face the hornets alone.""), Statham's po-faced delivery of death blows and direct dialogue and Ayer's typically chaotic direction, every element of The Beekeeper is gloriously OTT and filled with fine line balancing of tipping the scales too far, ending up managing to maintain a nature that is hard to not get behind.Without a takeaway message or anything holding it all together other than it's nice to sometimes see the irredeemably bad dispatched by a figure who decides justice is best served cold, Ayer's newest action packed outing may have little to ponder or look back on but for the brisk and event filled 100 minutes it covers, The Beekeeper does exactly what it set out to do and gives us a baggage free genre entry that reminds us all sometimes fun is all we need to keep us entertained.Final Say -A brazenly simplistic action thriller that loves its honey makers and dispatched bad guys, The Beekeeper is a film that tries little if at all to hide what it is and embraces its identity with a joy that's hard to not partake in.3 staples out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","IonicBreezeMachine","15 January 2024","Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a solitary man who keeps bees on a parcel of land rented to him by retired schoolteacher Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise is scammed out of her personal finances as well as those of a charity she manages by phishing scam operation lead by Garnett (David Witts), Clay and Eloise' daughter FBI Agent Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman) soon find out that Eloise committed suicide with the perpetrators most likely going to evade prosecution. Taking matters into his own hands, Clay dives into his combat skills he learned as part of a clandestine organization known as Beekeepers intent on bringing down the criminals who drove Eloise to her death which takes him through the highest echelons of power.The Beekeeper is an action thriller directed by David Ayer and starring Jason Statham. In a month that's seen no shortage of assassin/secret agent based action thrillers (The Bricklayer, Role Play, The Painter, etc.) if you're going to watch one of these movies, then The Beekeeper is definitely the one to choose.The Beekeeper is about as simple a premise as you can ask for with Statham's Clay your archetypical strong silent protagonist who motivated by some loss embarks on a path of revenge. Even in his 50s Statham hasn't lost step when it comes to delivering the goods and the script plays itself with a bit more humor than you'd expect which allows Statham to tap into that snarky side that plays to his advantage. The movie delivers some solid antagonists in Josh Hutcherson and David Witts whose cocky arrogance bringing to mind the worst aspects of tech/NFT bro tropes make them easy to hate and Jeremy Irons is quite fun as the head of security who acknowledges their deaths are basically foregone conclusions after angering a Beekeeper and only continues to organize protection details for them out of obligation rather than believing anything can be done. With the quirky clandestined world established in the movie regarding the Beekeepers, the film has more than a few shades of John Wick or other films in its DNA and for the most part if this is the beginning of a franchise I'm interested to see where they take it. The one downside is a sideplot involving Emmy Raver-Lampman's character Verona and her partner Wiley played by Bobby Naderi. While I understand having a character who follows someone like clay through a story like this, Verona is very poorly written as she seems like she's more upset about Clay's rampage than her mother's death and every time the movie pulls back from Clay to focus on these characters it only serves to stop the flow and reiterate information we already know.The Beekeeper is a solid ""B"" film that delivers the goods thanks to Ayer's tight direction and the always welcome presence of Statham. The Beekeeper like its titular hero is quick, clean, and efficient and you'll get your money's worth.","3/10"
"The Beekeeper","jacekfx","31 January 2024","This could had been a good movie.They clearly had good budget. Maybe some explosions looked fake, but cars, costumes, etc were fine. They had good actors. I like Statham and Jeremy Irons. Event the general concept for the story is bearable. Everyone knows that it is not Godfather, but just some action movie.But they mixed the good stuff, with some completely nonsensical characters and events. The worst are final scenes, what ruins the movie even more. I don't wont to spoil, so I won't say nothing more.Also there is a lot of unnatural exposition. Characters explain a lot to each other. Even in situations where they clearly both should know it. Writer clearly was not able to ""show"" information. Everything must be explained in chat-gpt style dialogues.","8/10"

"The Beekeeper","Rich-Lee-Bailey","9 February 2024","I'll watch any movie with Jason Statham in it, and I am more than likely always going to enjoy it. The film does have that whole John Wick vibe, like, you don't mess with John Wick, and the same goes for the beekeeper.I do miss the good old real kick-ass Statham has delivered previously in his transporter films. The film could have showcased more of Statham's impressive fighting skills, which would have been a great addition.I enjoy a good action film like this now and then. It's not cinema material, but not many films are these days.The girl playing the FBI agent whose mum got killed in the beginning has no acting abilities whatsoever. She sucks just as badly in this as she does in the umbrella academy. Something about her is annoying, but I can't pinpoint it.","10/10"
"The Beekeeper","GenghisKhan69","19 January 2024","If you are looking for a fun, fast-paced, and furious action movie, you might want to check out The Beekeeper, starring Jason Statham as a former special agent who becomes a vigilante after his friend is scammed by a ruthless tech mogul. The movie is directed by David Ayer, who knows how to deliver explosive set pieces and gritty violence, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who adds some clever twists and witty dialogue to the formulaic plot.The movie is essentially a showcase for Statham's charisma and skills, as he plays a man who lives a quiet life as a beekeeper in the countryside, until his friend and mentor falls victim to a phishing scheme that drains her life savings. Here Jason Stathams character then embarks on a mission to track down and punish the culprits responisble leading to a hive of concpiracies and plot twists.The movie does not take itself too seriously, and neither should the audience. The plot is full of holes and implausibilities, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, and the dialogue is often cheesy and clich√©d. However, the movie also has a sense of humor and self-awareness, and does not shy away from poking fun at its own absurdity and genre conventions. The movie also delivers on the action front, with plenty of shootouts, chases, fights, and explosions, all staged with flair and energy by David Ayer.Statham is in his element, as he dispatches his enemies with style and efficiency, while also displaying some emotional range and vulnerability in certain scenes. The supporting cast is also solid, with Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson hamming it up as the villains, and various supporting casts adding some warmth and depth to the story.The movie is not without its flaws, and it is certainly not for everyone. Some viewers might find it too violent, too silly, or too predictable. However, for fans of Statham and action movies in general, The Beekeeper is a satisfying and entertaining ride that will keep you buzzing for 90 minutes. It is the best kind of bad movie, one that knows what it is and what it wants to be, and delivers on its promise. The Beekeeper is a honey of an action movie, and you might want to give it a try.","10/10"

"The Beekeeper","DeathbyExile","14 February 2024","This movie is just fun to watch. It's got that John Wick feel but much less gore (there's still a little bit). It's a movie that doesn't exactly take itself seriously, which is a good thing. It's one of those movies that you go and have an escape. Sometimes a movie doesn't need to be overly philosophical or pretentious like some iterations of the Matrix. The writing/acting isn't as bad as some people have you believe. Jason Statham plays himself like he does in all the other movies. He's basically The Transporter, a cold calculating killer. And that's okay. He fits this role well.The action scenes are pretty over the top, but that's exactly what you're paying for. If you're going to watch this movie for the 'realism', you're watching the movie wrong.Go watch the movie with some friends, have a good time, and don't take yourself too seriously.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","mujali-48677","11 March 2024","I really enjoyed this. I knew what I'd be getting and it did exactly what was on the tin. Dodgy accent- tick, scumbag bad guys- tick, completely unrealistic but fun and satisfying action scenes-tick. Big Jase going about his life quietly not bothering anybody, until the bad guys hurt someone he likes and it's time for retribution, Statham style. I'm not sure what disappointed reviewers were expecting from a Jason Statham film, The Graduate? A deep dive in to the complexity of the human condition? Films don't always need to make us think about our existence or be a commentary on an increasingly more depressing society. This is top notch fun.","2/10"
"The Beekeeper","otterspocket-44488","17 February 2024","How Irons and even Stratham read this script and still decided to take part is beyond me. It is the most ridiculous dialogue. The acting is so wooden it would make Pinocchio blush. The benefit is that it makes good conversation, laughing with your fellow torture victims about the utter pretentious seriousness the film seems to take itself. So, the Beekeeper is an analogy. Strangely Mr Stratham is so mentally dim he's not realised that and thinks his job actually does involve keeping bees. We also had an opportunity to not suffer Streatham's god awful American accent, given as he's supposed to be from one of ""The British Isles"" in the movie, but no. Unfortunately Jason still felt the need to butcher it as normal.","9/10"

White guys are of course the bad guys. The sidekick is of course a dark skinned woman. Obviously the only reason she got the part is because of her gender and skin color.

"The Beekeeper","rgkarim","13 January 2024","LIKES:The Pace
-The movie is like most Statham led movies, very loud and very fast, much like the theme of his series Crank.-The Beekeeper doesn't pull its foot of the gas for much of the movie, and for those who love the adrenaline rush, you are in great shape to enjoy this film.-It pretty much stays at a nice hundred miles an hour, but also takes time to reset for some faster paced setups to get you ready for the next mayhem to unleash on the screen.-All in all, great for those with fleeting attention spans.The Humor
-Whether direct or indirect, I laughed a lot in this movie, so much so that it made me have some of the most fun in a film I have had.-The Beekeeper has plenty of zingers to sting your funny bone, making you crack up with the way Statham dryly delivers a message, or Irons sarcasm and logic comes out like Scar.-Poking fun at the government system and the political jokes were toned back, purposeful and nicely finessed to be very, very fun without being too much.-And throw the character profiles being extremely goofy and adding an element of their own only helping further make the ordeal stupid fun and entertaining, alongside some of the stunts and finishes that just scream suspense of disbelief.The Story To A Degree
-It's got a better story than I anticipated, one that is simple, easy to follow, and perfect anchoring to the mishaps coming.-The Beekeeper's story surprisingly has some decent character development to mix in, helping give some clarity to a few of the players in this weird game of extreme action chess.-And there is a little bit of a nice ""twist"" to the mix that should help give a little more to the plot they are conveying, but not enough to trip or offset the main focus of this movie.The Action Scenes On Many Moments
-Perhaps the meat of the movie, the action is all about what most will be coming to see this movie for, and I'll say, it's fun to say the least.-From the first bout on, Statham and the team get creative in just how much fun a special agent can have with the masses, providing lots of playgrounds to do battle on that help mix up the theme of the action at hand.-Throw in the combat essentially changing hands to be one part martial arts, one part knife play, and many parts gunplay, and well, you have one heck of an arsenal to get invested into.-And many of these movements have such rawness to it, a destructive bout of shots and editing to really give you everything action junkies want in a movie with such a hardened lead.-This is where the sound and cinema work the most. Not in the beautiful shots of emotional wellness, or the beautiful backdrop, and backdrops. .
-No, instead this time it's about pulling together and bringing the pure spectacle of elite ops vs. The world, and it accomplishes it in that Statham glory.The Emotional Fulfillment
-There are those movies that know how to deliver that shot and moment that just screams full satisfaction.-To my surprise, the Beekeeper accomplished this for me, several of those moments captured in the perfect shot as the Statham gets that hit or kill that just makes you nod.-It adds a little more to the violence, gives some depth to his character without words, and helps to give this movie just that bit of depth that other films in this franchise lose when it's all about mediocre presentation.The Music
-A nice little mix of genres, the music has some comedic aspects and energy as Clay journeys on his quest for vengeance.-One part is song you will know, a blend of a lot of tracks that match the dynamic of the scene. While the other part is a typical Hollywood soundtrack of powerful instruments in the background to add that small oomph to the symphony of sound effects.DISLIKES:The Plot
-It's nothing special and quite linear, good on many levels, but will get lost in the sea of action films that we have.-There is little diving into most characters, it's quite lacking in terms of unique fervor, and the extra information just doesn't have the delivery that much of the John Wick series does.-It's not what most are going for, but... given some of the legendary actions films have a bit more meat to their, I can't say I wasn't disappointed not to have more to the story.It's Sort Of Ridiculous
-To an extent, all action movies are ridiculous.-But in this film, the movie's stunts are sometimes a bit too silly and extreme to not laugh and lose the respect and focus I had in the first part of the film.-Throw in the unbalanced strength factors in this movie being quite wider than I like to see and the movie just breaches a story that sort of lacks that organization I like to see in movies like these that have that balance of comic awesomeness and reality edge.Excessive Language
-By this point I've become desensitized, but the language is annoying at times to the point that again, there are better phrases and words to use.-The F and MF terminology is their bread and butter of the movie, so if you have a sensitivity for these words, avoid this movie at all costs or be ready expletive city.-It's lazy writing at times, but it sells, and at times they nail the timing and make it worthwhile.Some Violence Hard To Watch
-There are many moments that desensitized people like me can handle with no issues and laughing at the pure bliss of excitement.-And then there are some moments that are going to be hard, cringeworthy stabs, carving, and a few other means that are going to be hard to watch.-Though it doesn't hit the levels of Hostel or Saw, it may still be something to be wary of given some of the finishing moves Statham brings with it.An Element Of Action.-Mainly a lot of invincibility/superman complexes for much of the movie that can lead it to be a bit boring.-Wick, Olympus has Fallen, James Bond, and more take hits and come close to taking hits, which adds excitement, fun, and that danger sense.-The BeeKeeper though doesn't do this much of the movie, meaning the spectacle and finishes carry the excitement rather than the threat to our antihero. Had they cleaned that up a bit, it might have added even more to the mix.The VERDICT:
The BeeKeeper is a smash hit when it comes to the mindless action and fun of watching a one man army take out the bad guys. Very fast, very exciting, and holding enough merit to build a foundation that will give a meaning to the chaos and violence you are watching. Comedy helps add some pizazz to the mix, a little relief to the darker undertones that go well with the action. Add in the sense of justice and some engaging action that really helps this movie thrive and excel in the promised entertainment the trailers sent in their advertising. And with the simplicity comes the limitations of story, the stupid antics that are hyperbolic feats of super human levels, and some rather one sided antics that can be a bit stale. Throw in some hyper language use and some hard to watch moments, and you round out this movie to some Statham fun that is familiar, a tad stale, and dare I say a bit too familiar to be unique and engaging. Still, this one is worth a trip to the theater for just the fun times, and definitely one worth watching at home.My scores:

Otherwise we will bring them to Justice; and take over the country until the UDHR has been manifested.The same applies to Israel, namely the oppressive Netanyahu regime; Netanyahu being responsible for the incitement that led to PM Yitzhak Rabin's 1995 assassination and sabotaging Peace Talks. Hence the Israeli government must end apartheid and the occupation of Palestine - by implementing Equality, International Law and Universal Suffrage.NB: Just like 2,500 years ago - during the Iron Age - tyrants, fanatics and evildoers still clobber each other over the head, aiming to exert dominance and slavery over each other; in particular guys like Ali Khamenei, Netanyahu and the mad Putin regime, which is very disappointing. Hence we must finally all work together to manifest World Peace and the UDHR.But no worries, if all else fails, I'll take over these countries - as the current President of the Middle East, UK, Russia and United States.NB: The Putin regime is responsible for the killings of Human Rights Defenders and critics of the corrupt and evil egime; such as Alexei Navalny.

"The Beekeeper","SPZMaxinema","14 January 2024","Is this another generic action movie where things take place that don't really make sense? Yes. Is the plot ridiculous in the way that it unfolds? Yes. But I really admire Jason Statham and his ability to entertain. The action/fight scenes were noteworthy and it was a very satisfying story of revenge for the most part. I just can't help but love to see him kick some ass. It's by no means like a John Wick 4 or any other mind blowing action movie of today's time with its directing and sequences but it's not the worst I've seen either!

"The Beekeeper","mail-69063","12 February 2024","Jason Statham is just a quiet and withdrawn man, somewhere in the middle of nowhere, trying not to attract attention. But then, when something bad is done to someone in his neighborhood by an evil gangster who is untouchable by the justice system, it turns out that he is an ex-special forces. Although he has sworn never to kill again, he decides to release the killer in him once again in order to get rid of his neighbor, who we only saw on the screen for 3 minutes. Unstoppable and without really experiencing any serious resistance or being injured, he now fights his way to the final boss, who he gives a beating. Sounds familiar? Yes, because that feels like the story of every single Jason Statham movie!!!!!","1/10"
"The Beekeeper","blueycrter","5 February 2024","There has been a long line of John Wick copy cats e.g. The Wrath of Man and Mr Nobody: i.e. Emotional inciting incident brings professional killer out of retirement to get revenge. With hidden lore and a secret society.This is the worst possible version of those.The inciting incident is contrived, the dialogue between Jason Statham and the old lady feels like they are reading their scripts for the first time. The scamming scene is a little Wolf of Wallstreet cliche, but its probably the best scene in the movie.. then the emotional impact of the lady's death is completely ruined by Jason Statham being surprised by FBI daughter. Also why would the lady kill herself before getting help from her FBI daughter...The rest of the movie is just action action action... but I was yawning throughout. 20 years ago the choreography would be passable, but it isn't doing anything exciting or original. It's not gritty or impressive or believable. It never feels like Statham is ever in danger, or has to put any effort in. About 50 times, a 'bad guy' has a gun aimed at him, and doesn't shoot. Its cliche after cliche. ""Jason Statham ran this way - Freeze!"" turns out it's a different bald man in the same suit. I'd rather be forced to watch every episode of One Piece at 0.25x speed than learn more about beekeeper lore, it's repetitive and doesn't make any sense.In conclusion David Ayer is a bad director who rushed every take, doesn't understand action, has bad taste in music and should consider a new career.... no offense. The producers should cut it down to 2 minutes and use it as a PSA about the dangers of internet scammers.","10/10"
"The Beekeeper","GreatorexLee","17 January 2024","A a really, really fun film. What I love about The Beekeeper is it feels like a genuine classic action b-movie. The odd dialogue and clunky changes in tone never feel forced or like satire of classic action b-movies. Instead it's a genuinely idiosyncratic movie that provides possibly unintentional comedy along with some great action scenes.I had so much fun watching this and will definitely be buying the DVD when it's out. The perfect movie to watch with a few beers. Some classic clunky social commentary just like many of the second tier action movies of the 80s and 90s. Some fantastic villains too although I would have loved to have seen much more of at least two of them.Good cast! Josh Hutcherson is great in this whilst Jeremy Irons and Minnie Driver are essentially pointless but add character to this strange but highly enjoyable movie.","1/10"

"The Beekeeper","axeman_z","19 January 2024","There are lots of action movies that gets released but few that are worth watching. This is one of the ones worth watching. It's not an incredibly deep story/premise, but it is a good story that you wish were real, and yet another film that elevates Jason Statham (again) as the most reliably good action movie star of the last 20+ years. Statham's performance, though never in a scene for extended amounts of time with any one actor save the agent, elevates all their performances for the story. Speaking of the story/mythology, it's as good or better than a certain franchise (looking at you Wick) and yet it probably won't see the endless number of sequels, if it even gets one. I highly suggest you go see the movie in theaters and enjoy it. This is a day one purchase for me when it's home release happens.","8/10"

It runs through the whole of this film with a modern and very relevant antagonist. They storyline of course is less believable in places but if you just want a good old fashioned action flick like some suggest a throwback to those in the 80's and 90's here it is. Films are meant to bring emotion, and I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in the cinema gave a little virtual fist pump as each odious baddie got their comeuppance.I titled this as 'much better than I expected' because the trailer came across like some sort of parody action film, yes the bee reference is a little comical at times but I think it fits, and overall if action is your thing like John Wick you'll leave the cinema with a sile on your face.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","antoniotierno","13 January 2024","When Statham's tranquil life-in-retirement is shattered by the death-by-suicide, we start expectedly seeing the usual Jason's character. So he switches into vengeance mode. With beatings, explosions, gunplay and more. It's what happens in a Jason Statham movie. We're talking about genuine crowd-pleaser, action like in a live-action cartoon. No shades of gray here. There is obviously the risk of the whole thing getting and turning into a big clich√©, leaving the sensation of a deja-vue. Bit going to much such a movie results in the risk of having to watch such a story, which is properly packed, on the whole.","2/10"

There are some surprise actors in this other than Stathan like Jeremy Irons and Felicia Rashad. But others are just terrible actors and even come off as cartoony at times. Plus, like every other mainstream movie, they force diversity and it's too much.

Not completely the actresses fault because whoever wrote the scenes for her character gave her dialog that is just so dumb, even a really good actress would have a hard time pulling the charcter off.The rest of the cast are not even worth mentioning. Let's just say they could have gone down the street grabbing pedestrians at random, and handed them the script for a 10 minute breeze through before putting them in front of a camera to act out their scenes, and the movie could only be better by doing so.The script is so terrible and corny even Stamos has a hard time being believable. But how could he? He's playing the role of a real beekeper, that raises actual honeybees, all while being in an organization called beekeepers that keep the bad guys in check.

"The Beekeeper","statuskuo","13 January 2024","I dunno, for me, the revenge plot will never get old. In this case Jason Statham plays a dude who gets triggered into action when the only lady who looked out for him gets offed and he goes into action. Have you ever noticed that these revenge films seem to take on an air of horror movies sometimes. Like baddies are sliced and diced away in horrific ways. The hero in this case, seems to be a supernatural entity that can't be killed.The term ""beekeeper"" in this sense means a few things. And writer Kurt Wimmer taps into the mentality of a bee hive. Suppose he got into a hobby and decided to draw parallels between the two. It gets absurd people.Director David Ayer has drawn a ton of fire for some mis-steps in the DC world, but in this world he works well. Everyone will compare this to John Wick. Which...I understand the framework looks similar but this is, to me, closer to ""The Equalizer"".The problem is that we know very little about the relationship between him and the catalyst for his vengeance. It's not catastrophic that he goes into action (a suicide). The ire falls on a party kid who is related to very powerful person. The issue is that his money is also the basis of how this powerful person got to where they are. Yes, the absurdity of the plot is very dumb. But, it's also not that serious.Statham is being pursued by the daughter of the woman who killed herself. Who also happens to be an FBI agent. Keep in mind, her Mother just committed suicide, and she's cracking wise with her partner. Fun as that may seem, it does feel odd.That said...who cares? It's silly. I mean, Jeremy Iron plays a former head of the CIA. He knows he's collecting a paycheck. As is Minnie Driver. And so forth. They know how camp this has to be.BUT, it's not campy enough. In my opinion, it needed to go full cartoon. And they try, with one last villain at the end who looks like a Street Fighter reject.This movie is wildly dumb but also...does have that so-dumb-it's fun.Turn your brain off and enjoy. Statham just likes wrecking havoc, busting chops and dispensing with comical bad guys in gruesome ways.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","chand-suhas","21 January 2024","The entire plot got revealed in the trailer itself. Adam Clay (Jason Statham) plays the beekeeper, who knows to protect the hive. He is humbled by how Eloise Parker treats him. When Eloise gets scammed to lose all her savings, resulting in her death, the beekeeper makes it his mission to hunt down the ones responsible. From one company to another, following the money, the beekeeper remains unstoppable. How he uncovers the brains behind the scam and exact his form of justice forms rest of the story.In a way this can be called Jason Statham's own John Wick and 45mins into the film, they even show a glimpse of what could be the crazy Beekeepers world would be, if they make a sequel. It's a basic screenplay and David Ayer doesn't falter a bit in narrating an engaging story amidst all the action. It's over the top from the word go and a larger than life action star, carrying the film with his mere screen presence. Thought the reveal was predictable, the build up provided till the Boston fight scene and ofcourse the climax action scene, works well. The Beekeeper is a fun one time watch and a far better Jason Satham film since Wrath of Man.","5/10"

They could have done a better job of showing her inner battle between being thankful for Jason and also trying to do her job. She made this movie go from a 10 to a 5.

"The Beekeeper","JoshuaMercott","18 February 2024","As heart-racing as it was entertaining, ""The Beekeeper"" saw Jason Statham once again delivering a high-octane action-hero performance that was memorable, thrilling, and suspenseful. He still has the ability to make the implausible feel credible.Statham played the role of a retired top-tier secret agent named Adam Clay who worked for a covert organization called The Beekeepers; from where the movie got its name. When someone he respected was harmed, Adam chose vengeance over forgiveness, and went to town on the individuals responsible.Though the story was anything but original, I loved how they put on quite the show and communicated a potent message about the strong protecting the weak. I liked the script's simple yet impactful approach. The story also showcased the negative near-unstoppable power malware still poses on our pro-tech society.Phishing was what led Adam on his path of vengeance after his kind-hearted friend and lessor Eloise was swindled by a shady company whose scams were linked to a bigger political game. After losing everything, Eloise had little choice but to commit suicide.So much of this is happening even today, making this theme in ""The Beekeeper"" supremely relevant. Heartless phishing is taking place all over the world and the idea lent this movie a wake-up-call vibe that I appreciated.Special shout-out to Eloise Parker (played by Phylicia Rashad), David Witts (as Mickey Garnett), Emmy Raver-Lampman (as Agent Verona Parker), Bobby Naderi (as Agent Matt Wiley), Josh Hutcherson (as Derek Danforth), Jeremy Irons (as Wallace Westwyld), Minnie Driver (as Director Janet Harward), and Jemma Redgrave (as POTUS Danforth).Though some of the tropes and dialogues in the movie were a tad aggrandized, in favour of the titular Beekeeper, the story managed to inform and entertain nonetheless. The team also cleverly wove in a few ""John Wick"" bounty elements, which stood well within the plot's parameters.The way the team connected scammers to corporations and government big-wigs was interesting, to say the least. They took theories that have been making the rounds for years and gave them an action-thriller twist with Statham at the helm.If only the world had real-life Adam Clays helping safeguard the 'hive'. Alas, such exemplary heroism seems only to exist in movies. ""The Beekeeper"" was one such story, and it was equally evocative and provocative.A sequel sounds like a buzzing good idea.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","dbisseker","14 February 2024","Noticed the director in the opening credits and it made me even more excited to watched. David Ayre ! What a weapon. Everything he does I thoroughly enjoy.This was a no nonsense action flick based in today's current climate. Jason Statham plays.... same old, Jason Statham. No holds barred action from the start to the finish in this action packed, out for blood, revenge flick.Interesting characters that at times look like X men characters. This movie had a lot to like about it albeit predictable at times.I did NOT like the female FBI character, Verona. She was cringey and unbelievable. I didn't like her appearance or presence in the film. I get it meets today's expectations, casting certain genders in roles to meet quotas however I believe this movie could've done without her. There's no way she'd get through basic training let alone survive this far into the movie if it was realistic, but all that aside - she wasn't good.Very entertaining and impressive flick.Not much to think about.Just enjoy the action amongst the gunfire.","10/10"

The plot talks about the current issue of cybercrimes. This is an issue that needs more attention. There were great stunts and some comedy.

"The Beekeeper","movieman6-413-929510","14 January 2024","The Beekeeper is a new action thriller film from David Ayer, director of Fury and Suicide Squad.Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a retired special agent of the secret organization called The Beekeepers. During his retirement, he rents a place to keep bees from old Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad).When Eloise is scammed online, she loses all her money and discovers her life. As a result, Adam goes after the online organization in revenge to stop them before they manage to scam other elderly people. Because of this revenge, Adam himself becomes a target of the FBI and he gets Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman) Eloise, her daughter, after him.With this action film they seem to be playing on the lame, entertaining action films from the 80s and 90s. Action actors like Sylvester Stallone's Arnold Schwarzenegger have to do exaggerated things to make someone blush, while making a silly joke. Furthermore, the film also plays on concepts from more modern action films such as John Wick where there are hidden organizations with special rules for mutual special agents.Despite these familiar aspects for fans of previous action films, the story of this film remains a bit rushed and bundled. Apart from the exaggerated, lame action parts, the film itself is sometimes a bit difficult to keep up with. If the writer had focused a little more on the imaginary story and used a little less different characters in the film, it could have been a little easier to follow. The message about the bad sides of scamming people online or with fake calls is somewhat lost.The effects don't always come across either. Some flames and explosions are not always clear, because the CGI is so clearly visible. Sometimes you can also see where they use pupae after the beekeeper ends his strong with his opponents.Jason Statham once again delivers suitable acting in the leading role of this action film. This is already the fifth action film he has made in a row in recent times. The rest of the film cast also delivers suitable work, but due to the more selected sides, most of them get few opportunities to really do something with their characters in the film.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","Shaunmatthewc","17 January 2024","I really enjoyed this, I can't lie. Coming as an 80s action fan and following Statham's career since the early days of Snatch and the first Transporter film. His character in this befriends an old lady who falls for a phishing scam and kills herself.Then it's up to him to take revenge on everyone responsible with some of the most over the top ""Punisher like"" kills ever seen. There's something righteous about seeing these horrible people get their comeuppance which doesn't happen as much in real life unfortunately. Everyone in this acts well, the over the top Kiwi henchmen who pops up was hilarious.Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a good job as a couple of slimy villains. Emmy Raver-Lampman from Umbrella Academy is decent enough as an FBI agent trying to stop The Beekeeper. If you like old school action and don't need to be pummeled over the head with virtue signalling or any other messaging I would definitely recommend this. It's nice to see Statham bounce back with Meg 2 and this film after the abysmal Expendables 4.","7/10"

""Matrix, what have you left for us? Bodies.""But all the scenes without Jason, and first of all - the whole line with the FBI agent - complete garbage, she is pointless, pathetic, boring, and stupid dialogues in her performance - sound really stupid. Cut her character out of the plot - nothing would change, she doesn't participate in its development at all.Bottom line, if you somewhere near 40, Sly and Arny were your idols in childhood, and muscular men with a minimum of dialog, but a huge charisma warm your heart - it's safe to watch, especially skipping characters - fillers.","2/10"

But his vengeance isn't a one-and-done event. He keeps attacking up the organizational ladder and the interesting twist in this is who's at the top of that ladder. Yes, he's a one-man army which gets kinda stupid as time goes on, but it's not terribly implausible. Josh Hutcherson co-stars against type as a douchey bad guy. Though he achieves his objective in the end, the actual ending is kind of inconclusive so that was a bit irritating which cost it another star for my review.","2/10"

This is a collection of scenes from other movies you have definitely seen before, stitched together but not to form a coherent whole. I watched for 40 mins and don't want or care to know what came after that. The bad guys are just annoying kids. Jeremy Irons is wasted and this does nothing for Jason Statham's rich back catalogue. Don't waste your time.","10/10"
"The Beekeeper","blaisewoods1985","14 January 2024","Already another favorite of Jason Statham! This movie is great, action packed and a great story. This is something that I think needs to happen to these online scammers. Jason Statham plays a beekeeper who after a woman who has taken care of him for years gets caught in an online scam and gets robbed of her money and in distress commits suicide. After Statham finds out, he seeks revenge, and is to be revealed as a retired agent who was part of a top secret program in the CIA known as The Beekeepers. In his quest for revenge, he finds out it's a lot more than a phishing scam. David Ayer did a great job directing this film! 10 out of 10!","1/10"

"The Beekeeper","mohamedmasoud-33106","8 February 2024","OMG!!I just finished watching this movie and i really have to say this is one of the worst action movies i have seen for jason Statham
Seriously i don't know what to say but this movie doesn't have anything good about it to mention
Bad acting , bad script and the whole thing is making no sense for me to be honest
The character of verona is one of the worst written characters
They tried to make another version of john wick but this went so wrong.Also i don't know wtf is going on with all of these cops , i mean none of them can shoot with a gun ??? I know it's just a movie but not putting at least some logic on it is so annoying for me tbh
Finally I'd like to say this movie doesn't worth money or time and i really would never recommend it to anyone who looks for a good action movie
I will give it a solid 1/10.","5/10"
"The Beekeeper","endrits","14 February 2024","Expect Statham, who has the usual role, and he knows how to play it by heart, almost all the other part of the acting crew doesn't know how to act. I do not know if this is the new normal, as I've seen a lot of this kind of poor acting in the recent years, but in my opinion, actors put little to no effort on the play. This is the case even for this movie. The screenplay seems to focus more on action and violence, leaving no space and time for things that would be normal in the logic of the movie, like the human relationship and sentiments, like the feelings of a daughter for her dead mom, or no positive feelings for the helping guy. All in all, you can laugh 2-3 times, but really, not any kind of emotion during or after watching this. Anyway it's watchable if you don't mind for the acting level.","9/10"
"The Beekeeper","Jampierre","4 February 2024","It has been years since I've seen a movie that keeps you entertained basically the entire time. The dialogue is genuinely fun. They do a great job of making you really hate the ""bad guys."" The complete implausibility of the plot actually adds to the appeal, and you really don't care. It's a ""good guy vs. Evil guy"" adventure. You don't have to think too hard. Great action scenes, comedic breaks, and all-around good time. I usually enjoy historical fiction, documentaries, and movies that generally make you think, so it's nice to have something like this that allows you to just relax and enjoy. Highly recommended.","7/10"
"The Beekeeper","AfricanBro","20 January 2024","The opening title sequence sets an intense and epic vibe, almost like a dark psychological thriller. This is an instant classic, instant! It's like if John Wick was the equalizer, but it's Jason Statham, who happens to have a fascination with bees and bee analogies. While I recently haven't watched Statham's best movies, this one compelled me to label it as some of his best work yet. But that's probably the adrenaline speaking. The fight scenes were both cool and intimidating, often laced with moments of humor as Statham toyed with his adversaries.The story was just okay, nothing spectacular even though the big bad was essentially the biggest big-bad; but to be honest the story's just a bonus, it's like a favor from the writers because the whole movie is really just Jason Statham engaging in relentless action, whooping butt. I think this is the first action movie of this sort I've enjoyed this much since the first two equalizer films with Denzel Washington.Now, my primary gripe lies in the lack of truly formidable antagonists-except for the Afrikaans dude, most of the villains felt rather lackluster in posing a challenge to Mr. Cray. A touch of additional villainous depth could have heightened the movie's tension. Bad guys could've been more bad ass. I always knew Mr cray was gonna win the next fight, it never felt like the stakes were high.Jason Statham undoubtedly shines as one of the finest action stars, showcasing his prowess in this film. Fifth movie in a year. I love how even though there's a few funny bits, they're not inherently comical; the main character has serious, no-nonsense demeanor, maintaining a dark and brutal persona throughout. The film wisely refrains from diluting this intensity with unnecessary jokes or lightheartedness. While not flawless-some minor issues with dialogue and acting in non-action segments-I highly recommend if you're an action fan. But even if you're not, because my sister had a blast with this too.Also there are no credit scenes, I googled but a couple websites seem to have it mixed up with Aquaman credit scene.","1/10"
"The Beekeeper","elmoutesidi","25 February 2024","So.... I truly believe that the people who said the Marvels was bad, or she Hulk etc are the same ones saying this movie was great. How is this movie at 6.4???? How??? It was so bad it's not even laughable or a B movie. I love Josan Statham... But this was not his best work. They tried to make an action packed Hamlet. It was painful to watch. To get from point A, this movie went all the way to Z, fast, without logic. The police was worse than stormtroopers. The bad guy, who needs Catniss once again to save him, I cannot even bring any more words to describe him. I wonder at times if actors are even ashamed of their work. These actors really should be ashamed for being in this joke.","3/10"
"The Beekeeper","craignewtonrff","22 February 2024","Welp. Where to start? Jason was ok & did what he was supposed to do; the action scenes were pretty good & had some creativity to them.However; I've never seen acting as bad as this from all the secondary characters-ESPECIALLY the lead FBI agent; she was awful (with all due respect) just not believable one bit. It was cringey-no chemistry at all with the partner; not sure how she got the role. She sure got over her mom's suicide pretty quick at the beginning. I always stay for every movie even watching credits to the end. This almost had me walking out. What happened to even ""B"" movies? This was a little entertaining but that was it.The last line of the movie was roll your eyes bad-he disappears in the water and the screen goes to credits and the lights come up-it was ""that's it, over, now get out""I always appreciate how we as individuals view film in our own way-I'm sure people really liked it but we all have opinions and this one was mine.

Minnie Driver is pointlessly wasted in a role with about a minute of screentime while the cop Verona who supposedly to be grieved for her mother's death instead runs around Statham is a pointless and a major drawback...The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing for powerful fighting scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Statham once again proves why he's the go-to guy for heart-pounding action. A must-watch for fans of intense storytelling and jaw-dropping combat sequences...","1/10"

"The Beekeeper","edmond_melkomian","21 January 2024","I loved this movie. A vigilante taking revenge on the unscrupulous people who take advantage of senior citizens who have no knowledge of computers and combine that with shady political characters. Jason Statham shines in this movie. There isn't much dialogue, the line where he breaks into building and counts 1-2-3 for the security guard was a classic. The fighting and the fight scenes were really good. On the only negative side was that he got rid of the new beekeeper quickly and I also hope when they shot up the bee hives, they didn't actually destroy any. Overall a fun movie to watch and great action.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","talllwoood13","6 February 2024","I saw this movie the other day and there were parts of it that were really well directed or written, however that ending was just poorly done. The casting was all over the place, it's like they had to find a balance between ""woke"" and hipster like casting. I hate the hairstyle that someone had to have agreed upon for ""Verona Parker"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Then of course the other bee keeper Jason Statham fights in the gas station just made me cringe. Just another person trying hard to embrace the 1980s style and culture but probably didn't grow up in it with her awful haircut, the jacket and anything else just made it look like they were trying too hard. However that was one of the best scenes in the movie without any doubt. In the call centers I would have rather Jason fly to ""South Asia"" and do all the destruction that he does over there as we all know where most of those scams are coming from! However language barriers and all that would be a bit difficult. Instead Jason barely drives across America. Maybe a state or two maximum and he just beats up or murders hipsters for the most part. Sure there are actual soldiers and everything but those call centers are mostly hipsters who the only time they have probably ever seen a firearm was playing Call Of Duty while they ate Doritos and drank Mountain Dew to be ""ironic"".The bad guys plot was horrible, we didn't need the 28 year old. However he played his role well to be that unlikable. I do feel Jeremy Irons should have been the actual bad guy instead. The worst thing that hipster looking kid probably did was forgetting to tip a waiter I'd look at him as. The second the movie got to the second call center it REALLY went downhill. Finally revealing how the mother got where she was and trying to link all these silly things together. It's like the movie ""The Painter"" which came out recently where the movie was good but the endings were awful. I even sat through until the end of the credits hoping we'd get a bit more but nope!The final fight was well done, it wasn't a one sided Steven Seagal fight. The fact that Jason was fighting against men he didn't intend to kill and shooting them in the body armor to knock them out was good. They even tried to implement bee facts in the movie as besides that the most we had was Jason tossing a jar of honey at someone. They had a few creative kills as well in this. I loved the bridge scene the most or when they are in the barn.The current rating of 6.5 is a perfect rating for this. It had a ton of potential to become a better movie but a different director and work on the script may have improved it. Who knows maybe in 2034 or 2044 there will be a remake. They've made them for lesser movies.","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","joeygvlahakis","18 February 2024","I'm a huge Jason Statham fan, i was lured in by the fantastic trailer. Statham and Jeremy Irons delivered strong performances, however in my opinion the plot lacked believability, resembling the introduction of John Wick in terms of a feared protagonist. It felt like an attempt to replicate the success of the John Wick franchise. Despite this, I see potential for redemption in a sequel. Regretfully, I should have waited for the movie to hit mainstream television to save some bucks. I'll give it another watch, hoping for a different perspective and anticipating improvements in a potential sequel.","8/10"
"The Beekeeper","KyleML222","15 January 2024","I am a big Jason Statham fan. Every year, I wait for a Good hard R Statham action movie. It's been a Few years since we got one of those. Wrath of man and Homefront are the most recent examples so it doesn't happen often. I have been waiting for this movie patiently but was cautiously optimistic. I was excited for this movie and I left the theatre satisfied. It's a good solid action film with a few creative set pieces. A few good kills and some good hand to hand combat. It isn't John Wick but it didn't need to be. Good throwback action movie. Not going to win any awards, but a good time at the movies!","6/10"
"The Beekeeper","darkreignn","14 January 2024","I am not a fan of David Ayer, but I am a fan of Jason Statham, and so - also being inspired by the positive reviews - I decided to drag my dad to the theatre with me to watch this movie. And on one hand, I enjoyed it as a Statham action vehicle; on the other hand, this film is chock-full of virtually every single David Ayer cliche that you can imagine.Is there near-constant cussing in this movie because of script writing that would make middle school students blush? Yes, there is. Are there a large number of ridiculous looking and absurdly dressed characters that you cannot envision being in anything other than an Ayer picture? Oh, you better believe it. And is there over-the-top violence that has absolutely no business being portrayed as anything that would remotely even take place in the realm of reality? Of course! It's all standard Ayer fare, and while I am not too much of a proponent of that, I found ""The Beekeeper"" to be as entertaining as it was thanks, in part, to those creative decisions.As much as I would've appreciated a more straightforward, grounded take on the action genre, I'd be lying if I said that the ludicrousness of it all wasn't entertaining, because it was. From the constant bee puns and the hilariously energetic villains that would give Jordan Belfort a run for his money to Statham's stoic and almost inhuman performance and all of the horror villain-esque violence that he delivers upon his enemies, ""The Beekeeper"" is straight-laced farce. This is a movie that's dumb, and knows that it's dumb, but plays itself as serious as humanly possible. Because of that, you'll find yourself laughing with the movie while also finding a great deal to enjoy from the action sequences.""The Beekeeper"" features Statham at his most brutal, perhaps ever, employing a range of tactics that dispatch the film's villains in increasingly violent manners. Statham is a force to be reckoned with here, more akin to The Punisher than John Wick, and it really works. It's all very silly, but the brutality is fitting, especially since the villains are so despicable. You really want to see the villains get what's coming to them, and you get that through a series of action sequences that are each more elaborate than the next. I cannot emphasize enough how stupid the movie is, but I also can't emphasize enough how fun it is to watch on the silver screen.I am still not a fan of David Ayer after watching this movie, but I am impressed about how entertaining ""The Beekeeper"" managed to be. As I said, I would've preferred a more gritty, serious action movie than this was, but for what it was, this was fun, and I will definitely be adding this to my physical media collection.","5/10"
"The Beekeeper","jonwade","31 January 2024","I enjoyed Beekeeper - the same way you enjoy a 1980's straight to video action flick. In places it was unintentionally hilarious.The accents of what seemed to be the mostly British cast were fantastic - American one moment - English the next - with Jeremy Irons appearing to be the first Brit ex head of the CIA before taking a stab at an American drawl later on in the movie.The fight scenes were good - the twisteroo with the bad guys mum was good.But the absolute pinnacle was the South African hit man Lazerous. Wonderful stuff - chewing the scenery from second one. The Stath had no problem identifying Lazerous' team in a crowded building as they were all dressed like extras in an MC Hammer video.Did enjoy it - had a good laugh - but it is not great.","2/10"
"Joker","TVpotatoCat","15 October 2019","There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.","7/10"

It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.

"Joker","Come-and-Review","1 September 2019","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.","10/10"
"Joker","mariamelkott","3 October 2019","I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness.

Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT.

Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.","10/10"

"Joker","RayCharles81","7 October 2019","Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.","6/10"
"Joker","logical_guy","1 September 2019","Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime","10/10"
"Joker","ernestoherreraf","25 October 2019","When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.","7/10"
"Joker","Red_Identity","11 October 2019","What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.","5/10"
"Joker","postofficecb","30 May 2020","They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise.","10/10"

Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.","10/10"
"Joker","Hitchcoc","7 March 2020","While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,
they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.","10/10"
"Joker","saveliydalmatov","2 January 2024","This is probably one of the most successful examples of a gorgeous solo film about some popular character.The Joker was played by the inimitable Joaquin Phoenix (known for his role in Gladiator), and people comparing him to Ledger are very narrow-minded, because Phoenix showed us a completely new Joker, who is gorgeous in his own way.The plot tells about a sick man Arthur, who suffers eternal ridicule over himself, lives and cares for his mother, and also dreams of being accepted by people, thanks to his performance on Murray's favorite humor show (De Niro)
As a result, we will see a man becoming a monster because of our society, of course not without his mental illness, but the nature of people clearly pushed the main character to become a Joker.This is a gorgeous dramatic thriller, with some cool reference for the future (little Bruce, Thomas Wayne, etc.), which is a must-watch! (And not only for DS fans)","10/10"
"Joker","pejv22","1 September 2019","I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his ""small"" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.","7/10"
"Joker","HakuMashentay","2 November 2019","I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many.this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.","8/10"
"Joker","Nhirscher","4 October 2019","In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.","7/10"
"Joker","romanwatson","6 October 2019","I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.","5/10"
"Joker","cherold","5 January 2020","In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it.","10/10"

"Joker","MissCzarChasm","28 November 2019","While we were at one of the only pre-screenings in my city, it has taken me a while to review this title, because I've been torn on it.Yes, Joaquin Phoenix, who has always been a veritable bastion of talent, was masterful in the role. Yes, Phoenix's portrayal of his character was riveting. Yes, the story was both gripping and also necessary, especially today when it seems that mental illness is running rampant. Yes, the tone was magnificently set within both the cinematic and art direction.What I have a problem with, is the way it tied into the Batman universe and particularly with what it had in common and what differentiated it from the
Jokers of the past. I still have problems making the two worlds merge.","9/10"
"Joker","Davor_Blazevic_1959","6 October 2019","Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.","8/10"
"Joker","sherylchilders82","15 November 2023","As a bleeding heart liberal and a person who also suffered from mental illness, I often detest stereotyping and simplified portrayals of both ""the disenfranchised"" and the mentally ill. But, despite the tropes and unrealistic nature of the Joker, this made excellent fiction. I think that if you interpret it though symbolism rather than taking it literally, that is where the message really lies.The thing this film adds to the modern DC universe is a truly empathetic story from a villain's perspective - the Joker. DC seems to be the jaded dark and Marvel the innocent Disney light. Don't get me wrong - I love Disney, but DC really balances it out.Of course you have to mention Phoenix, who won Best Actor for this role. We go from cringing and wanting to run away from this character, to sort of rooting for him by the end. Even though I'm just watching this in 2023, I remember everyone talking about his dance on the steps - so delightful. He's actually a good dancer lol. But, it's really at that point that you appreciate this origin story.There could be a lot to rip apart in this movie. While the elements and feelings ring of true representation, no literal interpretation would hold up. That's why I classify this as horror, which is historically full of metaphors and smoke and mirrors for deeper darker themes. It's why I don't get mad for any innuendo someone that doesn't understand mental illness or oppression might take from this. Because if you're trying to find reality in horror, you aren't getting the point.I think that underneath it, everyone can relate to the cruelty of the world and this darker part of you that wants to see someone pay for the unfairness. It's why we can empathize and laugh at the dance. If you don't get that, you must live a pretty charmed life. It's why we watch horror and love to hate violence. Denying this aspect of human nature is asking for trouble. This is the message of Joker. And, actually, it's a pretty universal bipartisan message.","6/10"

"Joker","paul_haakonsen","10 November 2019","Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.","8/10"
"Joker","bradenmueller","10 February 2024","'The Joker', a cinematic exploration of the darker corridors of society, delves into the complexities of mental health and societal neglect. The film's narrative structure is a masterpiece of storytelling, gradually unraveling the psyche of its protagonist, Arthur Fleck. His transformation into the Joker is not just a character arc; it's a disturbing mirror held up to society's failings.The thematic depth of 'The Joker' is where its true strength lies. It does more than just tell a story; it ignites a conversation about mental health in America, echoing sentiments familiar to followers of The Anarchist Symbol and Cercle Proudhon. The film's portrayal of a society that both creates and then shuns its monsters is a powerful commentary on the cyclical nature of neglect and violence.From a technical standpoint, 'The Joker' is a triumph. The cinematography masterfully captures the gritty, oppressive atmosphere of Gotham City, serving as a backdrop to Fleck's descent into madness. The score, haunting and melancholic, perfectly complements the film's tone, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.As a fan of The Anarchist Symbol and Cercle Proudhon, one can't help but appreciate the film's raw depiction of anarchic chaos as a response to societal breakdown. It's a stark reminder of the consequences of ignoring the marginalized and the mentally ill. The film doesn't glorify this chaos but presents it as an inevitable outcome of a society that fails to address its deepest issues.The portrayal of the Joker himself is a testament to the complexities of the human mind. His actions, while extreme and morally reprehensible, are depicted with a level of empathy that forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about the human condition and societal responsibility.In conclusion, 'The Joker' is a film that not only entertains but also challenges its audience. It's a bold statement on mental health, societal neglect, and the thin line between sanity and madness. The film might not offer solutions, but it undoubtedly sparks a necessary dialogue, making it a must-watch for those who dare to confront the darker aspects of our society.","10/10"
"Joker","davestroud-76036","4 October 2019","This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.","10/10"

"Joker","villard","18 January 2020","I'm dumbfounded this film gets such a high IMDB rating.If this was meant to be some kind of social commentary on the ravages of mental illness, it could have been done without hijacking one of the most colorful characters in the Batman comic book genre.Viewers are held hostage to two hours of somber, relentless depression, murder, and mayhem. There are endless shots of a solitary, anguished Joaquin Phoenix, which get pretty monotonous.In a nutshell: adopted boy suffers brain damage from a brutal father, lives with a sick mentally ill mother, and, after getting beat-up by street hooligans, builds a self-pitying clown alter-ego that's going to hold up a mirror to a dismissive society. *Yawn*Of all the actors who have played Joker, Heath Ledger got the right balance of being a scary, crazed, murderous, diabolically clever sociopath who could go toe-to-toe with Batman. The pathetic, hapless Phoenix character lacks all of that persona.Yes, Phoenix does an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar. But that alone doesn't save a film that is a boring flop because it is monotone, dark, dour, and mostly pointless.","10/10"
"Joker","SnoopyStyle","26 November 2019","Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on.","6/10"

Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters.

"Joker","Horst_In_Translation","5 November 2019","This is ""Joker"", a 2019 movie and the title is really telling what/who it is about. But first things first: The director is Todd Phillips and he is also one of several writers working on the screenplay for this 2-hour movie. Phillips is still mostly known for his Hangover films probably and in general for his collaborations with Zach Galifianakis. So gently-speaking, the filmmaker's career is not exactly filled with projects that were received greatly by critics. This one here is no exception either. General movie-goers apparently really loved it, but critics not so much. A bit like Bohemian Rhapsody not too long ago. That one I really adored though, this one here not so much. Still I am a big Joaquin Phoenix fan and as such, it is impossible to give the film a thumbs-down overall. He is the movie. And I am really glad he plays the title character because otherwise I maybe would not have liked it at all. Not just because of personal preference, but also because Phoenix really is that good from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene. Not too long ago, Jared Leto played the Joker (Batman's nemesis) and there was a lot of hype surrounding his turn that quickly vanished because he really did not have too much screen time at all and stayed pale in comparison to Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. But let's not drift away from this film here now. For Phoenix, all the hype is justified and well-deserved. I think he is still up there and a potential contender for the Oscar win this year with his nomination pretty much a safe deal and I read that it could be between him and Adam Driver and I like both for being slightly oddball, so I certainly approve. Of course with stuff like Her, The Master and my personal favorite Walk the Line under his belt, it is arguable if this one here should be the movie for which he gets a golden statuette, but I still hope he does. If we consider Daniel Day-Lewis retired now, he is probably the best actor working right now and as he is still under 50, that is quite impressive. At least in my opinion, but he is just so consistent and constantly adds depth to his characters in a way where you feel nobody else could have done it this well. He does so much with his eyes. Okay you get the message, I thought he was an amazing Joker.Sadly I cannot say the same about the film itself really. There are good moments here and there, no denying at all, but I was still not satisfied with the script I must say. It felt to me that, most of all, they were taking the safe route basically and going the way where it would obviously be a crowd pleaser, but somehow I must say that the film felt zero daring to me. Even the interactions with the Wayne family that could easily really have been goosebump material, felt a bit shoddy and for the sake of it all. I did like, however, that the way things seemed to turn out we thought it would definitely be the Joker who kills Bruce's father in the end because of the personal connection, but it was just one of his ""army"" eventually and it does not matter who did it. Joker is not really getting his hands dirty at that point anymore, he has others who do so for him. Also pay attention to how everybody who means something to him early on (his mother, De Niro's character most of all) are killed by him. I must say I did wonder though how they did not try to catch him after he strangles his mother. I mean as for the colleague at his apartment, it made more sense because the time between that and the show appearance was perhaps too short. But still the cops were following him and that was accurate. There, however, Clownmania was already going on in full force you could say. Big enough though for police not to go to the studio and arrest him right away? I would say I disagree.In general, this is a film where you can never really be sure how much of it is real and how much just happens in the protagonist's head. Like his relationship with the neighbor, but that is just the obvious one where we know it is fake, even if I did not see it coming. Of course also the relationship between his mother and Mr. Wayne (okay that seemed fairly far-fetched from the beginning, I mean Joker cannot be Batman's half-brother can he?) or the medical condition he has in terms of laughing or the idea about De Niro's character early on almost acting like a father figure to him in front of the camera, which most likely was fake too because there were no references later on that it was not his first time on the show. So this is a film that will certainly play with your head continuously because the only moments you can be 100% sure they are real and actually happening are those that include a great deal of violence, such as the killing of the three young men on the subway. Or the talk show host murder. Or the killing of his mother? Or maybe is that fake too? I mean it is a big step, even if she did invent the relationship with Bruce's dad. He really really cares for her. And he won't kill the colleague who always treated him well. I thought it was a psycho trick that he left the door closed and the guy is too small to reach the knob/key, but no he really just forgot it and lets him go eventually. He is a psychopath yes, but with his very own unpredictable style. Of course, there are aside from that these moments with all the over-the-top laughing, most notably when he visits the comedy show and laughs each and every time everybody else stays quiet and stays quiet himself when they are laughing at the punch lines. Now that was kinda hilarious because of how awkward it felt and also very telling because we saw how he totally did not fit in with everybody else, the average people.Okay, I think this would be pretty much all then. I mentioned some of the scenes that stayed most memorable to me. Maybe, most likely, you have different scenes that fit the description for you and that is perfectly fine because there are so many to pick from. There is hardly one that is really weak and I think the running time was accurate too and I don't say that too often about 2-hour movies that they should not have kept it a bit shorter on some occasions, so you can see it as a compliment. But like I mentioned previously already, those scenes that did stand out mostly did so because of Phoenix giving it his best and not really because of great writing. I think the dialogue writing was still a bit better than the writing of the action and what the characters were doing compared to saying, which sometimes made me forgot about the relatively weak ways in which the story was progressing. This also applies especially to the idea of everybody getting more and more crazy out there somehow. There is a fairly memorable quote from Fleck (Joker in his ""human form"") about that that they really could have made a lot with (also they included it in the trailer) story-wise, but the way they included the clown army for example felt really out of nowhere and it did not make too much sense to me. Okay we get it. Gotham is not at a good place to be right now, but with such a movement you just have to come up with a better explanation and elaboration and lead us there more convincingly. Okay that would be all then I liked and disliked about this film. It certainly won't make it into my top10 movies of the year and if it gets in at the Oscars for Best Picture, that is too much I think, but I wish Phoenix all the luck he can have for upcoming awards season because his turn here can really be described as greatness. There was always a lot of arguing about who's the best Joker. Nicholson? Ledger? Hamill? Romero? There is definitely a new name that can be added to the discussion now. All in all, the film gets a thumbs-up from me.","8/10"
"Joker","piecookie","20 October 2019","I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don't buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta ""standup"" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.
Is this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.","10/10"
"Joker","bob the moo","16 August 2020","Low expectations and subverted expectations play a big part in this film's success, although not the biggest part. The levels of expectation on a DC 'universe' film is now pretty low - to the point that someone with film OCD like myself has not bothered to even dip a toe in recent years; likewise what one expects from a superhero genre origin story is not something like this. The sense of pleasant surprise certainly helped the success of the film, but it is not the main thing.The main reason is the central performance of Phoenix. He is totally committed to selling his character throughout, and even in the weakest moments of narrative, you believe his character in terms of its roots, development, and actions. It is not a film that would normally be associated with awards, but it would be a significant failure were he not to be recognized for how much he delivered and how much he made the film. A secondary reason the film works is its cinematic heritage in the films of Scorsese in so much as it falls between Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. This is not accidental, and the casting deserve a lot of credit of getting actors of the quality of Phoenix and de Niro (although the latter does more as a reference than an actor). With these elements working well, the film produces an engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting the character. I could have done with it stopping just a few seconds earlier than it did, because I'm not sure that the ""maybe it was all imagined"" bit at the end was a good idea.Otherwise, it is enjoyably dark and deliberate, and is driven by Phoenix, even if the film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe.","9/10"
"Joker","Leofwine_draca","28 October 2020","A pretty good movie; not quite the masterpiece that some would have you believe, it's too derivative for that, but it's still worth a watch and there's no denying that Joaquin Phoenix delivers an excellent performance in the title role. My main bone of contention with this film is that it really doesn't need to be tied up to the whole superhero genre, setting up the rivalry with Batman for at least half the running time; it's a better film than that and would have served better as a stand-alone psychological portrait of mental breakdown. Films this seems to have been inspired by include THE MECHANIC, THE KING OF COMEDY and of course TAXI DRIVER.","9/10"

"Joker","NpMoviez","15 October 2019","DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+","7/10"

I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing","10/10"
"Joker","januszlvii","23 May 2020","Is Joker the worst comic book movie I ever saw? Oh yes beating Batman and Robin.( Phoenix surpassed the worst comic book performance of all-time by Alicia Silverstone ( Batgirl)). Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to get the movie, but I found it unpleasant ( except for the Sinatra music and the setting). I do not care for Arthur/Joker and did not have one speck of sympathy for him Why? For one his goal is not to make things better, it is about anarchy ( unlike say what we saw in V is for Vendetta). Spoilers ahead: Who people should feel for is young Bruce Wayne who sees his parents murdered in cold blood in front of him. There is nothing funny about seeing a child orphaned. As far as movies are concerned, I enjoyed Ledger and Nicholson as Joker, and I also liked him in comics and cartoons. Why? He is the perfect counterpoint to Batman, and vice versa.. Batman almost never laughs and Joker ( rarely) cries. This is a movie of hopelessness and depression, that makes you feel things cannot possibly get better. While Batman is the Dark Knight and that name alone says he not a fun loving character with wisecracks like Spider-Man, his presence in Gotham City gives hope of a better future ( something not seen in Joker). A very unpleasant experience that got me angry. I did not like the movie. 0/10 stars.","10/10"

The movie director knows precisely what he is doing, you are always left in suspense never knowing when the joker will burst on camera. You really feel this is a true story. The gore lever is managed perfectly for each scene, not too much, not too little. The blurred lines between reality and the joker's imagination is perfectly shown with clever editing and music management.. All the scenes are dark, the colors and grayish, to keep you in the mood of the story.","10/10"
"Joker","ahmetkozan","13 November 2019","Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10","10/10"

"Joker","classicsoncall","29 October 2019","Right out of the gate you can forget about considering this a comic book movie. It may be based on a comic book character, but the character development and story line can be taken right from the pages of modern day horrors brought about by poverty, abusive parents, disrespect for authority, the distance between the haves and the have-nots, and an uncaring society at large. With a plot often times structured on ambiguity, the film explores the troubled mind of one Arthur Fleck, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in what may eventually go down as the crowning achievement of his acting career. No offense intended to Jokers who have gone before, but Phoenix's take on the character now becomes the standard for others to follow, but virtually impossible to match. I must say, the hype engendered by the film prior to it's release relative to the amount of violence portrayed appears to be seriously overstated. Yes, there is violence on Arthur Fleck's part, all of it gruesome, but it virtually pales in comparison to what one might experience in any chapter of the 'Saw' series for example, or any number of slasher/gore flicks that rely on buckets of blood to 'entertain' fans of that persuasion. Together, director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have created a complex character and a complex film dealing with the horrific and sordid side of mental illness that finds it's release in savage, sociopathic behavior. Though he may be called the Joker, as Arthur Fleck himself would surely attest, ""...no one's laughing now"".","10/10"

I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger.

"Joker","kosmasp","15 January 2020","Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We're talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I'd see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a ""thrill park ride"". Now that doesn't mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this.

"Joker","ivo_shandor","28 September 2020","Great, but could have been even better. It was almost there. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic and definitely deserves his long overdue Oscar nomination. It's one of the more interesting DC films out there. There are a lot of great sequences and moments that define Phoenix's version of the Joker; you can feel the tension and creepiness in almost every scene. The cinematography is fantastic, as is the look of Gotham City. It actually feels more like Gotham than the Nolan movies. The one detriment of the film is that it is Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy almost beat for beat. While it is inspired by the films of Scorsese, it feels like it's just copying it straight out. If it were altered from Taxi Driver, but still kept the same slow burn, it would have been just as great. It is an interesting take on the Joker, but the fascination with his character is the mystery, and having his own film will always feel unnecessary. It does deserve credit though, for being different and trying to do it's own thing. Phoenix's costume and mannerisms are fantastic, and I like its homage to Cesar Romero. While it could use some light editing and a few changes to the ending, the film works for the most part, but it's overall goal seems a little unclear. A lot of people seemed to be unsure of the message of the movie, but it feels more like it's up to your own interpretation. It felt like you have to look at it from a certain point of view. Depending on how you look at it, some stuff will work and some won't. I'm a sucker for gritty crime films, gangster movies, and the Joker himself, so if you're a fan of the character and those types of film, it's for you. It is very unique, great production design, great look to everything, and a noteworthy take on a fun character, especially in its ending. It's worth seeing, and I hope it gets a few Oscars.","6/10"

"Joker","bwkuettel","4 March 2024","What a genius move it was to make a dark, well acted, character driven psychological thriller and Trojan horse it into theaters with the superhero movie connection by making it a stand-alone Joker origin story. While the beginning is a bit scripty, the movie becomes brilliant as it goes along by commenting on the importance of mental healthcare and how a very troubled individual can easily break and be a danger to society, but in this case indirectly harnessing people's frustrations at the corrupt elites of the world, or Gotham City, to become an unintentional icon of anarchy as he does by the end. Joker is interestingly the anti-Batman origin story, the other side of that coin.Joker recalls the greatest modern psychological thrillers like Fight Club, Nightcrawler, and American Pyscho with its incisive indictment of modern society and invoking that rousing feeling in the viewer to wake up, snap out of your everyday life, and think for yourself. Themes that have been done before and may seem obvious at first, but conveyed in an intimate manner through the eyes of a true psychopath in waiting. Like the aforementioned films, Joker will be especially impactful for empaths and disappointed idealists. It's ironic that the movie's pre-release controversy was about fears of it emboldening right-wing gun nuts and possibly causing city riots or something, when the entire movie ends up being about how crucial healthcare and competent city governance is!Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances of his career (which is saying something) and elevates the already solid screenplay with his brilliant acting. Certainly not in line with modern superhero movies, more akin to a classic Martin Scorsese crime film than a big budget Hollywood blockbuster, Joker is something special and Phoenix provides another brilliant performance as the iconic villain after Jack Nicholson and of course Heath Ledger.","9/10"
"Joker","statuskuo","19 October 2019","No one will ever say Joachin Phoenix didn't give his all, but if you watch enough loner-with-an-agenda film such as ""King Of Comedy"" or ""Taxi Driver"" you know where the pieces will fit.
The other thing is that the message of how society, in its neglect for the mentally ill will cause a rift in a population that is sick and tired of being sick and tired. In this case, where you identify with is where the Joker can get you. And empathize for what he must do. An achievement in making the unintentional sociopath that we see in all the movies. It's not without its charm. Granted, these dark misanthrope characters never bothered me...call me a dark person...there are sly nods at what is to be (a young Bruce Wayne sliding down a playset pole to greet Fleck was an especially nice one).
The other thing is what is known as anachronistic music and movies. Okay...having Cream and Gary Glitter and having Charlie Chaplin is no longer an alternate universe. It means Gotham is real and it kept having to readjust my mind that it wasn't New York City circa 1981. They either know our pop culture evolution or you don't.
The other thing...is that it still raises so many questions as to the Joker's history. A simple one of emotional betrayal by those he held close but can't exhibit closeness isn't going to work. The betrayal is meaningless. Which, unfortunately, is the ugliness of The Joker.
Who do you root for here. Thomas Wayne, the future tyrant capitalist, unwavering in a modicum of kindness who is a victim of rampant unrest between the rich and poor. Or the Joker, a product of the most sludge scraping bottom who does very little to further his lot in life other than to report to a menial job while being medicated to death? It's all ugly and there are no sunshine. That is NYC today...I mean Gotham. It's a perverse film that sets up larger ideas that seem to fizzle into an unnecessary overbearing notes of ""gee, isnt the music so different than what we see"" territory. Todd Phillips does an excellent job at capturing the time but look...it's either reality or it's not.","10/10"
"Joker","BandSAboutMovies","21 November 2019","Why does this movie exist? Who does it exist for? Why do people love it so much?These questions reverberated inside my head as it played in front of me. I was waiting for a moment where I would be awestruck, blasted by its sublime genius that so many people had trumped up or maybe even worried by the philosophy that so many people were worried about.I felt absolutely nothing.Joker might seem like a good movie if you've never seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. But here's my struggle. Those movies have something to say. Something to prove. They aspire to be art when this film is simply commerce.If you think this is a good film, tell me what it has to say. Tell me the meaning of it and why it exists other than, ""The Joker is cool"" or ""This is the Joker's origin story."" What is the purpose of watching a man's horrible life that never gets better and only gets worse and then the lives he touches get destroyed along the way.I mean, is it a cliche to use that sound and fury signifying nothing quote when this movie is so rote that it uses the song ""White Room"" in perhaps the most obvious of ways? Nothing is unexpected. Nothing is unique. This movie is the definition of wallpaper, albeit wallpaper bought by a tween at Hot Topic because they desperately yearn for something, anything, to make them seem different than the herd while mooing their way through the fields of utter boredom.Director Todd Phillips started his career by directing Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies while he was still a junior at NYU. His second film, Frat House, won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance before HBO bought it. It never aired, as many of the film's participants claimed they were paid to enact the scenes in the movie.A third film, the Phish-following Bittersweet Motel, was his last documentary before making the movies Road Trip and Old School for producer Ivan Reitman. His career since has been a series of successes, like Starsky & Hutch, School for Scoundrels, Due Date and The Hangover series.Which brings us to this movie.It's written by Scott Silver, who wrote 8 Mile - good - and X-Men Origins: Wolverine - bad. He also wrote The Fighter, which won him an Oscar nomination.I always feel like you should say something nice first.So here's goes.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is great. It's acting desperately searching for a better movie to be in. His goal was to play a character that audiences couldn't identify with - that seems odd for the main role in a movie - studying assassins instead of people who had played the Joker before.He plays Arthur Fleck, who starts out the film as a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother Penny (Francis Conroy, every season of American Horror Story). A disorder causes him to laugh out loud for no reason and he depends on the government for his meds.An attack while working as a clown leaves him needing a gun, a gun that falls out of his pocket while working in a children's hospital. He also begins dating his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beats, who was in Deadpool 2 and Slice) and finds that a video of him on stage has gone viral, ending up on his favorite TV program, The Murray Franklin Show.The fact that Robert DeNiro is inversing his The King of Comedy role, playing Jerry Langford instead of Rupert Pumpkin, is the type of creativity normally reserved for college freshmen who believe they are the first people to ever read Herman Hesse.Arthur is beaten up by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen. He shoots two of them in self-defense before feeling so good about himself that he kills the third. This leads to Thomas Wayne - who Arthur's mother believes is her son's father - denouncing whoever did this killing as a clown.Soon, people are rioting in the streets wearing clown masks and Arthur is finally feeling like his life has meaning. However, two Gotham cops visit his mother, looking for the killer of the businessmen, and she has a stroke. This causes Arthur to either go off the deep end or become sane, as his meds have run out. He realizes that he has no girlfriend and that everything in his mind has been a lie.This brings him to The Murray Franklin Show, where he embraces the name The Joker, inciting another riot that also leads to Joe Chill killing the Waynes inside Crime Alley after a showing of Zorro The Gay Blade. Yes, that really happens.Another potentially crazy person was angered by this movie. Jared Leto, who portrayed the Joker in Suicide Squad and reportedly sent used condoms and dead rats to his co-stars, was alienated and upset by the fact that Warner Brothers was making a Joker movie without him. He even left his agents over this and attempted to get people to cancel this movie.I've heard words like groundbreaking and Oscar being thrown about because of this movie. As a society, we've really devalued those two words, huh?This is a movie that may not even be about the real Joker. It might not even connect to anything. And it's a movie about a man forgotten and thrown away that becomes somebody before being nobody. It's also a waste of two hours of your time.Man, I should work in some other nice things. The cinematography feels large in scope, when so many other films seem small these days. I also loved seeing the old Warner Brothers logo.I mean, this won the Gold Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It also had an eight-minute long standing ovation.I sat there waiting, hoping, struggling to find one moment of entertainment and relevance and walked away saying, ""That was a movie."" It should be something more.Instead, I'll have to see people wearing this costume and thinking it has some significance. These are the same people who think naming the comedy club ""Pogo's Comedy Club"" is daring because it references John Wayne Gacy instead of hammer soft irony.We deserve better and have become so mired in the dross that we think that movies like this are worth something. I'm not being an elitist - I love popcorn films and if you read this site you know I have a soft spot for Italian horror and 80's slashers - but when I see something that is s***, I have to call it the purest s*** I've seen in years.","10/10"

All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!","6/10"
"Joker","PayPal-Gift-Card","24 February 2024","This was a major surprise for me. It was more than simply a comic book character's origin story: it was a brutally dark and brilliant depiction of one man's descent into madness, and director Todd Phillips brings all of the elements together to create one of the bleakest incarnations of the classic character.One thing that really impressed me was the fact that it managed to take a few steps back from the Batman universe without completely breaking connections to it. I think that's partially where some of the criticisms came from: those connections aren't often strong to completely classify this as an all-out comic book adaptation.The movie's greatest asset, as many have said, is Joaquin Phoenix, who landed his first Academy Award for his stunningly powerful and complex performance as Arthur. He gives the character a genuine soul, and he even allows the audience to like him and sympathize with Arthur. The film becomes more heartbreaking and terrifying as we see Arthur's despair completely take hold of him, and by the film's final scenes, I truly felt I had seen the Joker character make a complete and chilling emergence.This is one of my favorite films of the decade, and a genuinely chilling psychological thriller that balances the comic book elements with a more grounded story.","8/10"

"Joker","MadamWarden","3 October 2019","This is a good movie. Dark, tragic and brooding. So many excellent aspects to it. Great acting, sets, costumes. Fantastic score.But...The context is that this is The Joker of Batman Nemeses notoriety. The film just doesn't fit. Arthur is a truly sad and tragic, disturbed and intellectually challenged character. His back story is deeply disturbing and one cannot help but feel sympathy if not empathy. The REAL Joker is not a sad victim. He is a malevolent, intelligent maniac. Not someone you have an ounce of sympathy for.I think this movie fails because of this context. If it was purely a study into the psychological development of a sociopath I think it would be excellent. Sadly it is not. It is the origin story of a comic book baddie. Nothing comic book baddie about this miserable human.There are a few other issues I had with it, there primary one being that he is incapable of coherent speech and social interaction throughout the movie but he suddenly is able to produce a powerful monologue on set in front of a live audience and in front of TV cameras and his former idol. I understand that his confidence grows the less he has to lose but I found this jarring and dissonant.I also found his fantasy relationship silly and then overly ""explained"".That aside, Joachim is phenomenal!! A one man tour de force. Truly believable if not relatable.This is a must see for his performance but I think Batman fans will be disappointed.","8/10"
"Joker","wandernn1-81-683274","10 September 2023","Finally got a chance to see this after so long a time, and I was quite impressed. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as this character. The origin story of the Joker, and of course not every fan is going to like it. I don't really care about the comics or the lore, I'm just judging this story on its own. And I thought it was really good.Just another evidence that Metacritic is a lump, looking at the score it gets there.The performance really reminded me most of Caesar Romero's Joker. The laughing constantly and the sad clown part of it. It was a tribute to that time for sure.What a performance by Joaquin and some good writing here.8/10.","10/10"
"Joker","danteshamest","3 October 2019","While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance.","10/10"

Everybody is calling this a 'masterpiece', but nobody can tell me why it was such a masterpiece. If it was a movie about how a society creates a killer, then it was done very poorly. To me, it felt just like a large number of scenes without a real story.","10/10"
"Joker","LargeTortoise","21 February 2024","I'll be frank, I do not care about Batman at all. My entire friend group is into it so I keep up to date with them. But me not caring about Batman is why this is a good movie to me.It is an entertaining biopic of a legendary villain that presents good storytelling and a killer performance by Joaquin Phoenix. I would rewatch it willingly and will watch them going forward.For me, the only things I disliked about it are the aspects that make it too ""comic booky"" as I've taken to calling it. I enjoy lore. Alot. A bit too much by my own admission. What annoys me about comic based media is the general refusal to establish any lore. This more than most offers a ton of definitive reasons for Arthur's spiral into the Joker then rips it away. I understand why they do this for the sake of the comic heritage but its for that reason I physically cannot like this movie any more than a passing ""that was good"" before I forget about it a week later.I recommend it and I am sure that both comic fans and people like myself will thoroughly enjoy it. I am just in a weird situation where this genre was not meant for me and I have to accept that.","9/10"

"Joker","evanston_dad","11 October 2019","It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by ""Joker."" The last one I can think of that comes close was ""First Reformed"" from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas ""Joker"" is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood"" territory we're talking about here, where the word ""acting"" seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.There's a lot of controversy swirling around ""Joker."" Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy?"" I think people will see what they want to see in ""Joker."" Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily ""said"" anything. ""Joker"" is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?It will be interesting to see how my reactions to ""Joker"" change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.Grade: A","7/10"
"Joker","eddie_baggins","27 September 2019","Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries out of 5","5/10"
"Joker","fopfopfop","10 February 2020","So in a world full of horrible horrible superhero movies that are in nonstop production, this is refreshing, but this is not a superhero movie. For that matter this is not a super villain movie either. There is no batman, no superhero to be seen. Truthfully the movie feels like king of comedy mashed with a little taxi driver (admitted by phillips), with just a bit of v for vendetta, and seven thrown in. In that sense it is good and worth watching. It is dark, very twisted, and very deserving of its R rating. However, (and lets preface with what's to follow with I am not into superheros or comic books) this is not the origin story of a super genius arch enemy of batman. This guy can't read or write, there is no talent for chemistry to be seen, he seems mediocre in every sense other than he is a true psychopath. If this was about a guy who thought he was the joker from batman I would have probably applauded it, but as a super villain origin story I just don't buy it. Final thoughts on Phoenix's performance very convincing, very well done. So good movie on its own as a movie, but not a good origin story for a super villain (which affects its score).","10/10"
"Joker","Maxence_G","8 October 2019","Tonight, I went to see the movie Joker about the origins of Batman nemesis, as you may have noticed by reading my other entries in this diary, I had extremely high expectations for this film. With so many expectations, I thought it would be difficult for this work to touch me or surprise me. Yet coming out of the cinema I was completely dazzled, by what seems to me to be the best film of the decade. This film deals well with the psychology of the character, he approaches the character as never before, the end and the revelations that are made to me took my breath away. Finally, I hope that Joaquin Phoenix, the actor who plays the Joker probably achieved the performance of his life even outperforming his own interpretation of Commodus in the Gladiator film. In Todd Phillips' film Joker, he presented a performance that pays tribute to the great names in film. I am confident that his role will be honored at the Oscars and other major awards ceremonies.","8/10"
"Joker","ferguson-6","3 October 2019","Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind.","10/10"

"Joker","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5 October 2019","Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10","6/10"

"Joker","gatozangado","26 September 2019","It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.","7/10"

"Joker","trolliyama","31 January 2020","In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and in an endless sea of mediocre cape flicks released every year, the Joker obviously looks like a masterpiece by comparison.The movie itself is not as memorable or clever as the fanboys claim it is, but it still mesmerizes me the passionate reactions everyone seems to have about the Joker, with some acting as if this was some sort of cinematic Antichrist (Similar to the way in which a lot of people reacted to the mere existence of movies like the Da Vinci Code or the Last Temptation of the Christ back then) claiming it would definitely inspire acts of violence.I can't help but find ironic how a movie that demonizes the rich (To be fair, they totally deserve to be demonized) still manages to get lot of love from the same kind of reactionaries that would be against billionaires paying higher taxes, and also a lot of love from people who worship Trump as a god (Despite the fact that Trump and his cronies are very close in personality to the trio of rich jerks that harass Arthur in the subway than Thomas Wayne-Who, by the way, isn't exactly portrayed very sympathetically either)Must be a consequence of these clueless reviews and hot takes made by equally clueless reviewers that only focus in the fact that the main character is Caucasian and male, and not in the fact that he is poor and suffering from bad (physical and mental) health, despite the fact the movie clearly shows he is anything but privileged. And also, despite the fact the events from this movie are told from the perspective of Arthur Fleck, that doesn't mean the movie ""glorifies"" his behavior, nor is he portrayed as a hero (Also remember that plenty of scenes made very clear he is pretty delusional, so his perspective of the events is ambiguous at best, but it seems that modern audiences have become allergic to any form of ambiguity for some reason)Sometimes I wonder why the Batman-related media seems to have such bizarre effect on people. It's the Dark Knight all over again, a decent movie treated as the best thing since sliced bread. And while I admit that while this is better than anything from the MCU, I also think that kind of soulless corporate garbage shouldn't be the measure of quality for anything.","9/10"
"Joker","Lewis_Heather787","5 October 2019","An awful lot has been talked about this film even before it hit cinemas. From the triumphs at the film festivals to the backlash surrounding the subject matter of the film. There hasn't been a film in quiet like it in some time that has brought up such emotion/controversy in the public eye. Not gonna lie I was anticipating this film as soon as it was announced...........it was really fascinating to me as to why on earth Warner Bros. thought that audiences needed/wanted a Joker ""solo/origin"" film. There had to be something special about it........................my god is there something special about this film. It is truly unique not just as a comic book film but just as a film. Its more a psychological thriller than a comic book film.Joaquin Phoenix is a fantastic actor no-one can take that away from him, even before witnessing his performance in this film, the man is a truly great actor anyway. Wow just wow............I didn't think it was humanly possible that anyone could embody the character of the ""Joker"" quiet like Heath Ledger did over a decade ago....but wow does Phoenix come very very close. (I know you shouldn't compare......because its not fair on either performance...........there both fantastic in there own right). Phoenix's character Arthur Fleck is pretty much your every day person at the start, however its witnessing the terrible decline in one mans journey that is truly horrifying. I'm gonna say it he deserves at least an Oscar nomination...if not more. Takes your breath away.There are so many story elements to this film that just hit the nail right on the head, firstly the misdirection of Thomas Wayne being Arthur Flecks father is fantastic.....a really interesting angle however it is quickly super-seeded by the fact that Flecks mother was mentally unwell and made the whole thing up.....also whilst in the process uncovering that Fleck was adopted. His complete hallucination of Zazie Beetz character being involved with him, is done so so well, it only dawns on you at the final moment that it was a figment of his imagination........the figment being a really normal life. Mind blown!!!!!!!!!! All of which has such emotion and punch especially on Arthur........who is unwell, but that is slightly put upon him by the society that he inhabits. The culture of isolationism within Gotham City only fuels the fire raging inside Fleck waiting for the right moment to appear.......and boy it does.On to the controversy surrounding the film. My own personally opinion, anyone reading this is perfectly entitled to disagree, there is no controversy with this film at all. I believe the reason for people feeling uncomfortable with this film is because it shows a true representation of what would happen to a man like this.......and more importantly that it could happen in real life today. With the society we live in today in 2019, it is plausible what happens on screen could become reality to a certain degree. Thats the part, I think, that horrifies people. Its definitely not glorifying violence, this is not a tremendously violent film...it has its moments here and there. There are plenty more violent films that have been made and are going to be made. What this film does glorify is the stigma attached to class status and mental health illnesses, however its trying to open your eyes. The film is trying to make you look in the mirror and show you that this is our society really, that Gotham City and Arthur Fleck could be replaced by anyone and anywhere if we don't look at these societal problems. Thats what I think anyway.Final positive the score is out of this world. I know this sounds very snobby thing to say but the score really does inhabit an added character to the film........it is truly horrifying. Oscar nod 100%.Overall this film is great....I definitely need to see it again, it needs a deserves a second viewing to really understand and appreciate everything. 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10. Fantastic, real eye opening story, mind blowing performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Must also mention great directing from Todd Phillips.......the guy that did ""The Hangover"" did this.........wow. Even if your not a comic book film fan you must see this because this is least comic-booky film your ever going to see, ""King of Comedy"" meets ""Taxi Driver"".","10/10"

"Joker","cmills-98693","7 October 2019","Without a doubt, Joker is in contention for the film of the year.With Joachin Phoenix garnering praise left and right for Joker it's easy to dismiss the multiple other elements of direction, sound mixing, editing, cinematography, set and costume design and casting that make this a truly astounding piece of artistic cinema.
Joker is a film that without any one of these elements, it would fail. It would slip into the same bracket as Suicide Squad and be forgotten, but, fail it certainly does not.Joachin Phoenix is phenomenal. We know this already from pictures like Her and The Master, what we didn't know was how utterly deep and broad his range was. At points, I was totally absorbed by Joker. For the first time in possibly 10 years the movie theatre melted away, along with other viewers and noises and I was a part of that film. It was as if I was watching a documentary, rather than a fictional work. His commitment to the role, his weight loss and mental strain are dangerous but it produces something that no one ever thought would happen. It produces a performance that could genuinely rival Heath Ledgers.Todd Phillips direction and script are masterstrokes. If it were a painting it would be a Turner, with bright violent skies, and dark sad landscapes. His beautiful melting pot of inspiration features large doses of Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', alongside the physiological battery acid from more recent pictures such as Fight Club and Black Swan.
It swirls together to birth this bitter, gritty, dark, mesmerising masterpiece, that both requires and demands, multiple, in-depth viewings.For me, what makes this film is the costume design and the cinematography. The design of every minute detail on each character to make Gotham look even more drab and dull, even more grimy and beaten down is exceptional. Similar to how Scorsese made Harlem and The Bronx look broken and corrupted in Taxi Driver, you feel physically dirty after watching numerous sequences and you feel pangs of genuine social guilt stemming from your own moments of awful selfishness.
The cinematography is astounding, and MUST be in contention for an Academy Award, alongside Best Lead, Best Direction and best Sound Mixing. Some of the shots could have been lifted from a Time Magazine piece on 'City Life' they're that artistically powerful. Whole, dialogue-free sequences that say far more with silence and sounds of a city teetering on the brink of oblivion in the background than anyone could ever say. The sound mixing to have conversations, telephones, car horns, shouting, trains prevalent in the background audio leaking into the foreground does what Nolan did in 'Dunkirk' and pushes further the feeling of strain. The idea that even noise is seeping in from the city and soon the barricade will break and it'll drown us all in it's filth, corruption and decadence.Joker is a true masterpiece. So dark, so dirty, so vindictive of a modern flawed and broken societal system, but it always reminds you:
Put on a happy face.","7/10"

"Joker","Ruskington","25 October 2019","There isn't much else to say; Joker is one of the most absorbing, powerful films ever made. The cinematography is remarkable and the score is just perfectly potent and understated. This is not a thrill-a-minute movie designed to keep you entertained throughout. It is a heavy, all-consuming character study that invites you, with reluctance and fascination, into the mind of a severely disturbed outcast. I don't remember any movie leaving me feeling so emotionally disoriented as I left the cinema.The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something very special indeed. We spend nearly the full two hours just watching him close up and every second is exhilarating. Rarely, if ever, has a character been so utterly captivating, so desperate and so tragic. His physical acting, from writhing in anguish to dancing with warped delight, is utterly mesmerising. And not once did he ever lay it on too thick. To portray that level of pain and fury without indulging in excess morbidity or melodrama is quite an achievement.Forget where this masterpiece fits into the world of DC comics and Batman movies; Joker is a stand-alone film that deservedly takes its place amongst the greats.","10/10"

If the ""Joker"" wasn't one of a most culturally recognizable villains, this movie may not have the wide impact it's having.However - he is a central character in the DC comic universe. This movie gives him a plausible, wildly dark and often sad origin story. This would not be the same movie without Phoenix's eccentric performance. He made it disturbing and believable. If he wins the Oscar for lead actor, it will be the second time someone won an Oscar for being the Joker (the other being Heath Ledger in 2009).The story may hit a deep note with many people who've felt disenfranchised, alienated or ignored by society or their families. For 2 hours, I felt drawn into the world and crazed reality of the main character, Arthur Fleck (aka Joker). For that - I have to say it was a compelling watch.","9/10"

"Joker","naj-80897","12 October 2019","Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.","8/10"
"Joker","warthogjump","9 October 2019","The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other!","10/10"
"Joker","CatDayAfternoon","15 October 2019","I haven't been this obsessed with a movie since I saw Taxi Driver 30 years ago...and my obsession for Joker surpasses it in spades. Everyone else has said all there is to say, I can't really add to it other than to say it almost feels pointless to go to the movies after seeing this because it's impossible for anything to compare. I can't explain why it's so good, you just have to see it. The directing, cinematography, music, screenplay, and of course the jaw dropping acting....everything about it is flawless. The timing of the film is uncomfortable, yes, but I think it's needed. Joker doesn't teach us to be violent. It teaches us to STOP BEING SUCH ***HOLES TO EACH OTHER.I understand that not everyone will connect with this film or ""get it"". And you're not supposed to. This is a film for those who relate to it in some way and not everyone will. But if you do, if you get it, you won't ever see a more remarkable and all consuming film. It's truly astonishing filmmaking.And if it doesn't sweep every category at the Oscars because of controversy then shame on the Academy and shame on everyone voting.","7/10"

"Joker","botrytis","6 October 2019","This movie will show you how serious and uncomprehensible a mental state like this is.Joker didn't become like this just for no reason, the oppression, pressure, the environment that shaped him into this is all there. Making him not the only one to blame, or to call EVIL, the movie shows you perfectly how society can be dirty, unjust, inhuman, evil in the same way.You will feel for Joker, you will pity him, you will despise him, you will like him, you will fear him, these all feeligns will be there in you, the only thing that will be questionable is your judgement... you won't be able to judge him, only yourself and the system you live in.There is no hero here, it's a trip of torment where the pleasure comes in the form of understanding all the mess behind a twisted, deformed mind, a mind that by becoming a villain finally finds its peace, by becoming complete. There won't be a hero and a villain in the end, it will be a villain against other villain(s).There are already countless interpretations of all the plot this movie tells for 2 hours. But what's important here is the feeling you will have before-during-after the movie. Whichever conclusion you will get from this story it won't be happy.The storytelling is amazing, almost masterful, with only a few things that would needed more elaborativeness, details, and even those lacky parts only take place in the first half. So overall a close perfect story.The music is haunting, understandably conceptual, fitting organicaly to all this narrative.The acting is TOP-NOTCH! Just for that is important to see this movie, you won't see dedication like this anywhere that frequently.Cinematography is also hauntingly amazing, the colors, powerful, intimate scenes, you will see this world through the eyes of Joker himself, and the picture of this movie will represent that really powerfully.This is an important and a must-see motion picture. This will be the best movie you will see today amongst all that BS Hollywood/America selfglorifying mess! We live in a messy, imperfect, arrogant system and you better face it. This production will make anyone, even those who point their fingers on others to look in themselves and get some perspective of their own reality.","6/10"
"Joker","aldo-64339","13 October 2019","Todd Phillips and Joachin Phoenix have dug deep.. really deep, unearthing the first Joker character that is believable, not only in the comic book world, but in our world, the real world.The acting from Phoenix is stunning, almost too good at times which make some scenes excruciating to watch. A man's mental stability and health spiralling uncontrollably without filter. The cinematography is also spectacular, influenced largely on Scorsese's Taxi Driver as are other elements of this movie.There are also glaring similarities between this Joker and Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, however De Niro's character study, in my opinion, is better, but only just.Todd Philips' direction is well balanced and he guides us between tension and climax just right.Overall, Joker is dark and not like any other comic book movie, which is truly a good thing.","5/10"

Interesting but slightly bloated origin story of the arch criminal villain of The DC universe with Phoenix at the top of his game as the much-put-upon Arthur Fleck in Gotham City circa 1981 who reaches his breaking point and a moment of clarity of what his true significant purpose is in life with deadly consequences ensuing. While director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver) attempts to get in touch with his inner Scorsese by paralleling his worldview ala Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin (going full meta in even employing De Niro as talk-show host Murray Franklin) with far too many touchstones to count. Phoenix's chameleon-like physicality (shedding over 50 pounds) to give the slightly anemic/skeletal protagonist its spine by tapping into his own Christian Bale ala THE MECHANIC and his eerie, off-settling helpless cackle becomes instantly iconic in the canon of actors who've portrayed this homicidal harlequin.","8/10"

"Joker","TheUserIDYouEnteredHasAlready","4 October 2019","But the 10 star reviews that came flooding in were too much for me to take seriously, and I was right.By all means, go see Joker - it's a standalone origin story that needs no knowledge of the Batman series, but it also rewards fans of that series with some very convincing details and very believable storytelling.I won't get into the plot, but there are some twists. Very well done, in fact, even though they are both reminiscent of certain M. Knight Shymalan films. Very tastefully done and expertly integrated into the storyline without overindulgence and quite important for the story and character arcs at play. Bravo in that respect.Also, applause for the cinematography, the style, the homages to previous classics and just the wonderfully realistic atmosphere that the director and his crew were able to bring to life here. Positively the most believable and realistic Gotham ever. Some might find that to be a veiled critique, but it makes this film watchable and enjoyable by those who have no knowledge of the Batman franchise(s).Just altogether airtight production and direction. Hands down.The only gripe I have is with the score - not the songs, necessarily, but the use of over-dramatic violin/cello passages and too-loud unnecessary (and very dark) orchestral pieces that almost take the audience out of the experience. Those who have seen it may know what I am talking about, but no spoilers.All in all, this is very much worth watching even if I feel as though it may spawn some copycats in real life - sure to have a long ""cult film"" life after it fades from the cinemas.7.5/10 with no caveats.","10/10"
"Joker","dmehic","4 September 2019","Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.
The film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from ""Taxi Driver"" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from ""The King of Comedy"".
The film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name ""Joker"" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.
Although I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.
But still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to ""The Killing Joke"" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!
I'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76","8/10"
"Joker","Prismark10","10 October 2019","What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot. It is a tribute act because of the Scorsese movies that inspired it.","10/10"
"Joker","dti812","26 May 2020","Phoenix was over the top spooky and I guess very good in this role, but as a movie there wasnt much there. His mom played by Frances Conroy was good. I admire her talent, DeNiro doesnt move me much the past few years (decades?) and his teeth look like Martin Scorsese used some CGI magic left over from the Irishman to whiten them. I think the high rating for the film here are based on Phoenix's performance and not the film. A performance which I fear we will one day view as overrated.","9/10"

"Joker","abhinav-prkash","18 November 2019","Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.","10/10"

"Joker","MogwaiMovieReviews","9 October 2019","It's somewhat fortuitous that I saw the pilot episode of that dreadful Batwoman TV show on the same day I saw Joker. The two seem such polar opposites - one is rabid intersectionalist propaganda clumsily shaped by a newly-menstruating 13-year old into something that is almost *entirely* unlike anything recognizable as an actual story, with actual characters and believable situations, dialogue and acting.The other is... well, something other than that - I'm not entirely sure what, but whatever that something is, it can't help but come as something of a relief.The trailers at the cinema were for Feminist Terminator, Feminist Star Wars and 'The Emancipation of Harley Quinn': all explicitly anti-male, openly and unapologetically attacking and tearing down men and masculinity - and at the same time still fully expecting to appeal to the great majority of action, sci-fi and superhero fans, who have always been male.In 2019 it's hard to be a man and go to the cinema or turn on the TV without being told you're obsolete, or 'toxic', or just the biggest problem facing the world today since cancer. In 2019, Joker is the only big film which doesn't do that, the only film which looks at a straight white man as first and foremost a fragile human being in need of love, care, protection and help. In 2019, this, apparently, is a terrible, dangerous, unforgiveable and revolutionary act.Ho hum.* * *So look, the film has its strengths and weaknesses:On the plus side there is, as everyone knows, Joaquin Phoenix's astonishing performance - one of the most gripping pieces of screen acting ever. His Joker is just every tortured, beaten, defeated soul wrapped up in a weak, paper-thin shell that is slowly tearing apart and open before our eyes. He does a great job of showing the effects of the 'double bind' - the strain of being constantly instructed to do (or not do) opposing, contradictory or sometimes impossible things, which can snap an overburdened mind and at least potentially play a role in bringing on schizophrenia. I noticed several deliberately placed moments illustrating this early on in the movie.Secondly, the gorgeous cinematography, on grainy celluloid immediately makes one feel one is watching a stone-cold classic movie from the very start. It feels very much like it could have been shot in 1982 by Martin Scorcese, and there are vigorous nods to both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, as well as a bunch of other 70s crime films. I enjoyed that paying homage aspect of it very much.Thirdly, it is a gritty, realistic, serious and seriously made film - the like of which is rarely attempted today, and of course never as a superhero movie. This, though, is not entirely good news, which brings us to the minuses:The minuses are it's not a superhero movie of any kind. Grey-haired Joaquin seems a little too old for an origin story, and tone-wise, the only film that this could conceivably be a prequel to is The Dark Knight, and even that at a considerable stretch. I repeat for emphasis: Joker is not a superhero movie. Nothing extraordinary or fantastical happens that diverges from the ordinary wretched reality you can read about each day in the newspaper headlines. Because of that, it is quite a considerable downer, never really feels as though it leaves the ground, and eventually one does long for the days of Cesar Romero trapping Adam West in a huge yellow shoe or something.The more realistic you try to make a superhero comic book story, the less fantastical, and thereby enjoyable and entertaining the story will be. The single, solitary exception to this, the one film that captured lightning in a bottle, which DC have been catastrophically failing to repeat ever since, is The Dark Knight, and perhaps the greatest weakness of this present film is that it tries to take that realism even further, to a point where even the memory of the character the film is being based on in the first place is lost.In the final analysis, the whole thing just doesn't up to an awful lot, and without the fantastical superhero element the premise in retrospect seems a small and silly thing to base a film on. It feels much more like a biopic of an overly-bullied high school shooter in a clown mask, not a supervillain able to take on little Bruce Wayne all grown up in a batcopter. Phoenix's Joker is so debilitated and weak, with not one single strength or talent on display, it's impossible to imagine him surrounded by henchmen and weilding joke-shop weapons of mass destruction while strapping on a hi-tech utility belt.None of the other characters are fleshed out even a little, and no-one else's acting is in anything like the same league as the lead. Even though his King Of Comedy is an enormous influence on this film, every time Robert de Niro appears on the screen it just reminds us how he can't be bothered to act anymore, hasn't acted in decades, and now just turns up to collect the money. I have no real complaints about anyone else in the movie, but this is a one man show, and Joaquin Phoenix is the man.Politically, the film seems to have nothing to say and the constant nods in that direction are muddled and confused and seemingly just there for show. No ideas introduced are dealt with or resolved. It's a film of surfaces.For all this complaining, though, it's a shallow film that's still something of a must-see, for the mood, the look, the intensity, and Joaquin Phoenix's creepy ol' laugh.","8/10"

"Joker","martinrey-15593","1 June 2020","This is not an easy watch. It's dark and disturbing to witness the Jokers life just prior to turning into the criminal mastermind he becomes.
Joaquin Phoenix is very good as the Joker, his mannerisms and persona are consistent, meticulous and he carries the movie well. That leaves little else though for the cast around him. He's in pretty much every scene which makes the film intense and quite uneasy to watch as you see a man on severe medication get angrier and angrier.
It's a good film but it wont leave you in a happy or rewarding mood after.
There is a bit of Bruce Wayne in there which will leave you asking was there a 30+ year age gap between them?....

"Joker","SweetWilliam63","23 October 2019","Most movies that generate controversy come and go with little fanfare. Usually because they are not particularly good and therefore are tossed into the news cycle and disappeared abruptly and usually deservedly. There was that Seth Rogen movie about assassinating the Chinese dictator (never saw it), the 'Human Centipede' franchise that attempts to offend everybody (never will see it), and who can forget the conservative gasp over the American flag raising being left out of 'First Man' (saw it..meh). The problem with 'Joker' is it is good.
No, it's great. And unless you are prepared to deal with the guilt, misplaced or otherwise, over your enjoyment of it, then you should skip it because Phoenix will seduced you with his performance. Is it wrong given the times we live in? Oh, yes. That's what makes it so amazing. It is impossible to dismiss the fact that this is simply a shockingly brilliant performance. And director Todd Philips offers up nothing to reassure the audience that this is ""just a movie"". There is no gimmick or troupe, ""super"" or otherwise, to remind us that this is a comic book universe. There is no room for Affleck's 'Batman' in this Gotham. It is deliberately as unpreposterous a world that appears to be, tragically, not much removed from our own. There are flaws to the film to be sure (DeNiro is distractingly miscast, and 'Thomas Wayne' is unsympathetically Trumpesque) and there is an argument to be made that we have seen this indepth character study in madness done before (check out Harry Treadaway in 'Mr. Mercedes'). None of that matters. Rest assured 'Joker' won't take home any Oscars. It's too sinister for the times we find ourselves in. As for Phoenix, his performance demands a whole new category that surpasses ""best actor"". But it will have to do.","6/10"

"Joker","staticstation1","3 October 2019","Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors.","1/10"
"Joker","perica-43151","4 October 2019","There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a dishonest, knee-jerk defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their gaslighting charade might get uncovered. It is not Joker that is delusional, it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypo crites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is.","9/10"

Despite this, the film elicits empathy for the broken man it holds in its spotlight in the same way one might feel empathy for a diseased, mistreated, but ultimately unsalvageable dog.

Phenomenal.But, ironically, it looks like any other comic book origin story: There's a miserable, aspiring comedian who is down on his luck. He gets picked on by everyone. He has problems with his mother, his boss, his coworkers, etc. His idol, a famous comedian and late show host, humiliates him on national television. And so on, and so on.Maybe that's the point--or the joke--but it's still formulaic.Joaquin Phoenix's acting was a bit awkward at times but still good. You can tell that he's really passionate about the roll, which is kind of rare these days. There's nothing to say about the other actors, since Phoenix's character is the main focus.

It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world. The reason why people liked it so much is because the sad corporate slaves (especially the youth currently being indoctrinated) were subconsciously tricked into believing they were part of some bigger cause when they were really just sitting in their comfy chairs.","6/10"

This movie has such a gritty and realistic attitude towards it that my girlfriend (who has no clue about comics or Batman but i dragged her along into this!) asked me if this was based on a true story.Yes, the similarities to Taxi Driver, Fight Club and The King Of Comedy are obvious, but that doesn't hurt the movie at all. Some things you might see coming, which i usually hate, but this movie manages to leave more questions open, that it answers, so the enjoyment doesnt end when the movie finishes, you can debate about your theories for hours.I keep my reviews always spoiler free, I just wanna mention that I see what you tried here Todd Phillips, this movie is its own sequel - watch it and you'll understandA lovely character study and instant classic that will never get old. 11 years after Heath Ledger, this might be the next Joker that walks away with the little golden man, at least a nomination seems guaranteed!I can't stress enough how much i enjoyed that approach and would love to see more of these kind of movies, because this is what a comic adaptation really deserves.","10/10"
"Joker","barevfilm","24 September 2019","The movie JOKER, which had its world premiere at Venice 2019 and won the Golden Lion best film award on the Lido, has been mistakenly termed a ""comic book film"". True it is in a sense spinoff from the comic book based Batman film series, however, this is a serious non-comic book psychological study of how a would be stand-up comedian with a pathetic laughing syndrome goes wrong and becomes a psychotic killer. Joaquin Phoenix, 44, with his astounding interpretations of this peculiar character has now clearly established himself as the new king of Hollywood and even knocks off one of the old kings, Robert De Niro, in a short but telling sequence.
Basically this is a speculative account of how a notoriously evil public enemy, later to be known as ""The Joker"", started out as an innocent clown who loved his mother but was the victim of a ""condition"" (uncontrollable laughter) which made him a societal outcast and eventually warped his mind. His first killing which was basically in self defense when brutally attacked by three ""respectable"" men in a metro car is interpreted by the media as unmotivated murder because only we in the audience saw the brutal kicking attack. The irony is that the gun he pulled on them was given him by a fellow clown to use only in self defense. It turns out that his widowed mother has dark secrets of her own (which will peripherally connect us with the future Batman) but Phoenix as wannabe comedian ""Arthur Fleck "" (what a spotty name!) takes this role to the outer limits of the twilight zone as his frenzied laughter becomes more and more menacing. His constant disclaimer is ""I have a condition"" -- and what a condition it will turn out to be! -- culminating in his live on TV shooting of a Jay Leno type talk show host (De Niro) who, fascinated by his personality has invited Fleck to appear as a special guest. Not enough can be said of Joaquin Phoenix's bravura performance and the end result of this masterful film (Kudos to director Todd Phillips as well) is to shock you out of your pants. But a kind of shock that is exhilarating in the cinematic artistic and social sense.","6/10"
"Joker","littleging12","11 January 2020","Joker is the latest iteration of the Clown Prince of Crime. After many different versions of the character, director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix give their film a sense of identity by taking after Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. They do this by making this version darker, and more realistic to even greater extremes. Joaquin Phoenix gives such a stellar performance, he'd make Heath Ledger proud. Joker hits, and hits hard. It works as a riveting character study, as well as an unnervingly realistic depiction of mental illness.To say Joker is controversial is an understatement. The film deals with real world issues like mental illness, poverty, class wars, child abuse, antisocial behaviors, and anarchy. Many people will probably be put off with how disturbing the subject matter is. Others will see the film as glorifying antisocial behavior. Some will see it as mere entertainment. One thing that almost everyone can agree upon is this: this is one dark movie. Some people are afraid this film might incite real life violence. This film is similar to Fight Club, in regard that it comprises of crazy people doing anarchist things for the audience's amusement. Some people have valid concerns, however, Joker, although fictional, is a film that represents reality. There have been rebellions, and riots before, as well as class wars, and incidents incited by mentally disturbed individuals. Though the exact events of Joker have never happened in real life, they easily could. This film like most films should be left to viewers discretion. Art represents reality, and reality isn't always pretty.Some people may also be turned off by Joker's realism. The main character Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose alter ego is the Joker, is a man down on his luck suffering from a mental illness. This movie doesn't hold back by showing mental illness in all its ugliness. Crazy people have graced the screen before, but real life crazy is not glamorous in the slightest sense. You couldn't help but feel unnerved and disturbed by the sheer ugliness of this crazy crime-ridden, messed-up take on Gotham city. The world is so dark, apathetic, and brutal. The streets are littered with rats and other filth, government programs get shut down do to a lack of funding, and depressing scenery of busy toxic city life cram the screen. One can't blame Arthur for losing his mind.Something the film excelled at was getting the audience to empathize or feel bad for Arthur, aka The Joker. His life and the world around him is so soul-crushingly harsh. When the film starts out, he is not that bad of a guy. He cares for his ailing mother, works unfulfilling jobs, and fights his mental illness. The society crumbling around him creates the Joker. It's very realistic to see Joker unintentionally and indirectly starting all this mayhem and anarchy. He is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker extremely well. He is more of a mentally ill man wearing clown makeup than a larger-than-life supervillain. Joaquin plays the character in the shadow of Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, except Joaquin's character is even more socially isolated and disturbed.Joker is heavily influenced by Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy - two films that star Robert De Niro. Both of Scorsese's films deal with a mentally unhinged loner acting out against society in violent or antisocial ways. Joker tries to be a combination of the two films while molding itself into Batman lore. Joker successfully weaves its influences together without being derivative. If there are any criticisms, they are all minor - typical movie sins you find in most movies. To name a few, how does Arthur sneak a gun onto a Talk Show and how does he sneak into the Wayne theater so easily. Criticisms apart, along with two great Scorsese films, Joker stays with you with its compelling performances, disturbing subject matter, and shocking moments. Joker gets under your skin and lingers there.","2/10"
"Joker","reagansteyn","8 October 2019","This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after.","10/10"
"Joker","josephrygaard","17 October 2019","""Joker"" (2019) is a story about a man pushed to his limits from the society around him. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Before the review of Joker's contents, a few words need to be said about the controversy and debate Joker stirred prior to its release (and which still persists). Amongst other things, one caution has been that Joker tries to have the audience sympathize with a psychopath who commits violent crimes. The answers to presumptions in that category are very complex. Joker deals with tough topics such as mental illness, poverty, bullying and social class division to an extent where you are likely to feel impacted in some way. However, that doesn't mean that you justify the actions the main character, Arthur - and that is the point a lot of people fails to see. Sympathizing does not equal justifying, and while you can feel pity for the troubles Arthur goes through, you never condone the actions that he takes. Joker is not about that. Joker is about witnessing a man getting crushed under the vices of the people and system around him, and about understanding the role we as citizens and bystanders have in creating Jokers like him.That being said, this movie is psychologically dark and disturbing. Not purely from the grim and the Kafkaesque tone, but mainly from how real this movie is. Joker sucks you in to a sequence of events that could already be going on in some part of the world - and quite likely is. Nothing feels over-the-top or pushed, whether it be the characters, sexual elements, or even the violence. It all blends together perfectly together with the constantly menacing atmosphere. That is not to say that these elements don't exist or gets noticed - there are for example a few extremely graphic and violent scenes that are very impactful and piercing, but mainly because of their rarity and the underlying pressure behind them.Technically, this movie is a masterpiece. The cinematography is consistently gorgeous with amazing colors and just the right lighting, and the score is simplistic, hypnotizing and shockingly brutal. The pacing is perfection defined, and the dialogue will be quoted for years to come. Last but not least, Joaquin Phoenix delivers a feat which evolves Arthur into something more than an actor's performance.That leads us to the final question - does Phoenix's performance live up to that of Ledger's? While the different Jokers explores different sides of the Joker persona, there is little to no doubt that Phoenix has lived up to the sky-high level Ledger set. On a personal note: while I still revel in the chaotic dynamics of the Dark Knight, I ultimately find myself more intrigued and horrified with Arthur Fleck, and his gradual descent into madness, step by step.My personal grade: a haunting 9/10.

"Joker","Instant_Palmer","18 June 2020","Joaquin Phoenix produces one of the most memorable performances ever captured in a feature film, earning the hardware and accolades he received for his stunning and disturbing portayal of Joker.Joaquin puts on a virtuoso spotlight performance, and elevates the movie to legendary status. Credit director Todd Philips for building tension throughout the film, capturing the nuances of Joker's tortured dark-side slide into deranged, violent insanity, keeping the film's pace and flow on-track without unnecessary fill, utilizing and applying various camera lenses, shot angles, lighting, colors/hues, aperture settings (e.g. bokeh), and scene framing, and allowing Joaquin to tap into his own dark corners and utilize his unique acting instincts in developing his character.Phoenix's acting performance leaves nothing on the table - if keeping score, Phoenix tallies a perfect 10 producing a truly legendary performance, transforming the film from God knows what it would have been with another actor to a 9/10.A performance and film that one will not easily forget.","10/10"
"Joker","thomas-leitha","20 October 2019","Well played, well shot but one wonders why the movie theater is packed with Teens and Twens obviously enjoying the film.
The plot stays within the usual boundaries: Villains have to have a condition to avoid that society (even the rich) is left with all the blame. I have seen worse films but I apart from some very intense camera work and acting, I left the movie with mixed feelings, mostly because I wonder what makes others rave about this story. With all the current anger and protests around the world, from the yellow jackets in France to the protesters in Hong Kong, Quito, Barcelona and Santiago de Chile one explanation might be that this plot about the origin of anger and aggression in a troubled looser who blames individuals, not the system, to be ignorant and deaf to his needs, apparently seems logical to a generation without other means to explain their personal anger.","8/10"

"Joker","LeonardKniffel","23 May 2020","Reviewing ""Joker"" in ""The New Yorker,"" the great film critic Anthony Lane called it a ""lurid spectacle"" and a ""miserablist manifesto."" Other IMDB user reviews give away the plot, so I won't recap it, and the film FAQ in this database provides an exceptionally lengthy explanation for all the bewildering plot twists and possible motivations for Joaquin Phoenix's disturbing portrayal of a psychopathic killer with so many mental disorders it is impossible to name them all. Watching this film is like being subjected to a two-hour nightmare--not of anything in the viewer's brain or for that matter in the mind of the main character--unless it's a reminder to take your meds. No, it's all about the writer/director's attempt to cash in on our national cynicism. Although the movie pretends to be on the side of the poor, the abused, and the downtrodden, it also suggests that the evil media, the complacent rich, law enforcement, social workers, and just about every sane person in ""Gotham"" (read New York City) is part of an evil cabal that has taken control of the world. Just in case serial killer John Wayne Gacy didn't sound the death knell for professional clowns, this movie tries its best to do so. Other good films have been made about the insane taking over the asylum but never with this much cold calculated cash in mind and so little insight into insanity itself.""I happen to dislike the film as heartily as anything I've seen in the past decade,"" Anthony Lane said in his September 2019""New Yorker"" review, ""but I realize, equally, that to vent any inordinate wrath toward it is to fall straight into its trap, for outrage merely proves that our attention has been snagged. Just ask the President of the United States.""","7/10"
"Joker","YouTubeblack","10 October 2019","I went in the movie expecting a basic/ straight forward origin story of the joker and how he would fit in the Gotham of this Universe. But I got something else, an experience like never before from a comic book film. After the first watch I couldn't grasp everything, but after watching it for the third time, there are so many things happening that you would not even think of are happening, or ask yourself are they even real? The more you watch this film the more it grows on you, makes you think about the reality. The movie doesn't end on a straight forward conclusion, but keeps the mystery intact, and is open to interpretation. My take on this one is that, this movie is not about the joker which we know from the comics and live action movies, but it's about a man who impregnated this chaos in Gotham which led to hundreds of followers from which the real joker was born who became the arch nemesis of the batman. Joker is not about who is behind the mask but about the chaos which still passes down and is beyond his death.","10/10"
"Joker","cjs6547","5 November 2019","A real, raw and painfully guileless performance by Joaquin Phoenix contrasts with the captivating theatrics of Heath Ledger, and while the late actor achieved a beautiful onscreen presence, Phoenix delivers a new, memorably intimate take on the Joker.The story itself detaches from the usual comic book shenanigans and takes a serious, melodramatic route, which pointedly negates the black-and-white nature of good and evil. It's always tricky to try to garner sympathy for a villain by drawing on the tragedies in their past, but I think Joker safely accomplishes this, leaving us all conflicted. Some questions are answered in ways that leave the viewer unsatisfied and suspicious - a clever tactic to make each of us decide who we choose to believe.The direction and cinematography make this a captivating experience. Sudden events will elicit an awkward smile, while the rest is simply portentous and tragic.","7/10"
"Joker","lee_eisenberg","28 January 2020","One of the key tenets of superhero franchises is that there are well defined good guys and bad guys. But what if it weren't as simple as that? Todd Phillips's ""Joker"" subverts the genre, casting Batman's nemesis as the protagonist, portraying him as an abused, mentally unstable man at the end of his rope in a socially stratified Gotham City. We also get a different look at the Waynes: far from the upstanding citizen whom we expect, the dad is a heartless creep (servant Alfred isn't much better). It's one of the most intense movies that I've ever seen. Not at all like the comic book adaptations to which we're accustomed. It deserved its Golden Globe wins, and I'd say that it deserves at least one of the Oscars for which it's nominated.In addition to Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, there's also Robert DeNiro as a mean-spirited comic, Frances Conroy (of ""Six Feet Under"" and ""American Horror Story"") as the Joker's infirm mother, and a number of other people.","5/10"
"Joker","jelaniwilliams305","4 October 2019","When this film was announced, my initial thought was ""no one can come close to rivaling Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight'."" Let me tell you: Joaquin Phoenix give a phenomenal performance in ""Joker"" it'll be the biggest snub in Oscar history if he doesn't get nominated; he really dug deep for this one. As far as how it compares to Ledger's performance, it does, and it doesn't. It does because both will be talked about for years and will be considered some of the best performances in cinematic history that transcend any comic book movie portrayal by a long shot. Neither actor dialed in their performance; they each put the time and effort into making a unique interpretation of the character, which leads to the part where I mentioned that they don't compare because each version of the character are polar opposites of one another as far as their motives. Ledger's version was an agent of chaos; there was no reasoning behind his actions, he didn't have a clear backstory (it was multiple choice); he was just a guy that wanted to watch the world burn, and he portrayed that to perfection. Meanwhile, Phoenix's version, suffered from a mental illness all while being treated unfairly in life. We're taken through a series of tragic events through Arthur's perspective, that eventually push him over the edge and lead he to become the ""Clown Prince of Crime""; that was portrayed to perfection as well. Side Note: Robert De Niro was great too; even with the limited amount of screen time he had, he nailed the talk show host persona.The film itself is a SLOW burn. It's more of a character driven film that takes it's time to show you everything that happens in the titular characters life, which leads up to a BRUTAL finale. It's because of amount of breathing room this film has, it won't be for everyone; if you're expecting the usual, run-of-the-mill comic book film with tons of fighting scene, guns and explosions, you'll walk out severely disappointed. This is more of a drama/character study that lets you into Arthur's mind but once the chaos starts...OH BOY!!!!.The movie was shot really well; Todd Phillips made some great choices in this film from a direction standpoint; the lighting, certain scene transitions, zoom in/out shots were all terrific. I wouldn't mind seeing Phillips tackle more films like this one. Overall, Phoenix's performance alone was worth the price of admission; he was THAT good; however, as I stated earlier, the film takes a long time to develop, which I usually don't mind because I'm a very patient movie watcher, but if there comes a time where I'm thinking: ""that's been established, we can move on"" that's when I know they're taking a little too long and unfortunately, I had that thought a few times throughout. The good thing is the ending is really good and really established how Gotham became the chaotic, crime-ridden city we all are accustomed to and it shows why Batman is needed...","8/10"
"Joker","Michael Kenmore","11 October 2019","Normally I write the long review, but I'm going to keep it simple and concise this time.Without spoiling anything -- I suggest you do not read critics' reviews and watch this with a moderate expectation -- this film is an unexpected masterpiece, and the best comic book-based adaptation since Superman (1978).I have seen plenty of superhero movies, and I concur with Martin Scorsese's criticism of that as ""not cinema"" even though I differ with Scorsese's own output as self-indulgent and pretentious (in particular The Departed and Hugo were bloated and awful).However, Joker should be officially considered ""kino"" which is German for cinema, and utilized as a code of sorts among the Internet culture crowd to indicate ""encore; masterpiece; outstanding"".Watching this achieved something I did not expect, and that is of astonishment and catharsis. For that, my hat off to the reformed DC studio (which fired CEO after Justice League movie as a mega-flop to replace with a new leader) and Warner Bros that gave Todd Phillips and co. the chance to produce the bravest ""heavy and dark with the purpose"" cinema since, say, Fight Club, the latter I disliked but understood its messages.Joaquin Phoenix will not only own the Best Actor Oscar, but also that this film will sweep the Oscars with Todd winning Best Director and possibly Best Picture (Bradley Cooper being one of the producers).","9/10"
"Joker","Pjtaylor-96-138044","6 October 2019","'Joker (2019)' is one of the most intense and disturbing films I've seen in a long time. It really is surprisingly fantastic, an unsettling and complex character-study that's as uncompromising as it is gripping. Inspiration was clearly taken from 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' and, to a lesser degree, 'Taxi Driver (1976)', but this isn't just a cut-and-paste copy. It's very much its own beast, as much a horror movie as it is a comic-book one. Don't let Phillips fool you, by the way, this certainly is a comic-book movie. It's a phenomenal comic-book movie that blows almost all others out of the water, but a comic-book movie nonetheless. It takes inspiration from several well-known storylines and has a firm grasp on both its titular character and all the other classic Gotham elements, much more so than one might expect given the marketing. None of this is meant as a slight, just an exploration of the fact that comic-book movies are ""real"" movies. Here, we have a probable career-best performance from Phoenix, who's often frightening even when sitting still, and a definite career-best directorial effort from Phillips, who seems to have elevated himself far beyond the generally well-regarded 'The Hangover (2009)'. The whole thing is just so well-made, clearly crafted with absolute clarity of vision from the very beginning. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is gorgeous and the musical score is outright masterful. The flick works so well because it doesn't pretend there are 'heroes and villains'. You don't really identify with the protagonist, you pity him. You want him to be okay, to find a way out of his inevitably dark situation, but certainly aren't cheering along with him when things eventually get even worse. There's no 'good guy', just a guy. He undergoes some serious trauma and, often, the piece elicits a strong emotional response when this happens. Yet, when he decides to deal with it in a criminal way, you're never 'on his side'. Instead, you just watch in shock and horror, glued to the edge of your seat. Indeed, the violence here is some of the most impactful I've seen, each moment punching you straight in the gut. It's not fun, it's horrible and that's how it should be. There's no doubt that this is an amazing feature. It's absolutely gripping and I can't stress that enough. It gets under your skin and wriggles around, as interesting to reflect on as it is to watch. It's not exactly 'nice' but it's not supposed to be. It's brave, realistic stuff that's easily up there, right at the top, as one of the best of the year. As a footnote, I just can't believe how well they incorporated the Joker's classic laugh into a piece as grounded as this; it's chilling, tragic and integral to the character, yet still as over-the-top as you'd think (though, you might not realise it when it happens). Honestly, I still can't quite comprehend how good this whole affair is. It's simply divine.After a second watch, my option of the piece has dampened somewhat. It certainly doesn't have the impact that it used to. Plus, it clearly is a rip-off of 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' that Phillips, by his own admission, simply slapped a 'Joker' title on so that producers would take notice. Still, it's an effective film overall. It's just not as effective as I initially thought. I'll leave the rest of the review as it is, though, as I think there is some value in a 'first impression' of the piece; it clearly affected me the first time around, so deserves praise for that even if its impact has lessened on a rewatch.8/10.","10/10"
"Joker","pmtelefon","21 October 2019","It was refreshing watching ""Joker"" in the theater (AMC Raceway, Westbury, NY). It was really nice watching a movie that took a new approach to (somewhat) familiar material. It was nice seeing a movie that challenges the audience. For the most part, ""Joker"" succeeds in what it was trying to do. Writer/ director Todd Phillips and company deserve a lot of credit. The best thing about this movie is its look. It really feels like that time and place. The problem that I had with ""Joker"" is that it seemed to wear out its welcome after a while. Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. But if I was supposed to somehow sympathize with his character's plight, I didn't. I didn't really care about him or any of the other characters for that matter. When you watch a movie and don't really care about the people you're watching you can start to lose interest. I didn't look at my watch during ""Joker"" but I was tempted. Dishonorable mention: a miscast Robert De Niro.","10/10"

"Joker","zorrodg-316-238330","3 December 2019","Cinematography, costume design and one powerhouse performance do not a good movie make. In truth, Joker is poorly paced with a lackluster story that Frankenstiens together elements from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It borrows so liberally I'm amazed it didn't get hit with a plagiarism lawsuit.Additionally, the movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's sociological commentary is ham-fisted and bland, and it lacks any truly jaw-dropping moments. Outside of the Talk Show scene and a single shot near the end, it's all very forgettable.And the song for the stair dance sequence was so colossally stupid it completely pulled me out of the film.That being said, Joaquin was great and the aforementioned cinematography and costume design were very solid. All in all, the movie coasts on Phoenix's mesmerizing portrayal, but never goes far enough to really get under your skin. Biggest letdown of the year.","6/10"

This is the disturbing question the film poses in the figure of The Joker, equally fascinating, frightening and pitifully embodied by Phoenix, an unforgettable performance with great depth and a wide range of emotions: a Travis Bickle for the 21st century, and Robert De Niro himself paying tribute to this 43 years later after his own legendary performance in Taxi Driver.","10/10"

I've reached the point where if Joaquin is in it, I'm watching.DeNiro on the other hand, is mailing it in as is his current style. That he plays a dopey game show host is somewhat fitting. If you know who Joe Franklin was, it is a pretty accurate portrayal, but sadly, Bobby has become a parody.You know what's coming, but not how its coming. I was very sympathetic to his character. He was a loner, subjected to lots of emotional abuse. Its really amazing, but it's not for everybody.","10/10"
"Joker","The-Sarkologist","7 October 2019","Well, this was certainly quite an anticipated movie, and just to think that it was made by the guy that came up with The Hangover. Then again this film is certainly not a pleasant movie by no means, but that certainly does not necessarily mean that it is a bad movie. Yeah, it is meant to make you feel really uncomfortable, and in a way you sort of also feel a lot of sympathy for the main character. In a way, by the end of the film, I am really wanting him to actually become the Joker, though of course this is all left in Limbo with the way the ending actually comes about.One thing I have to say is that Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely outstanding. I remember people suggesting that nobody could ever top Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, and of course there was Jared Leno who came along with Suicide Squad, yet Joaquin Phoenix truly moves this character to a completely new level. Yeah, we all suspected that the Joker was crazy, but the way Phoenix captures the dark insanity of the character, the way he captures his mental illness, is absolutely outstanding.Thus, what begs the question is, could he actually be the Joker that we all know and love (and if it wasn't for the fact that the Joker is a much loved villain we wouldn't have got this movie - in fact I'm not at all sure if there is any other villian out there that could literally have a movie of their own). The reason I say this is because Phoenix's Joker is seriously disabled, yet when we encounter the Joker elsewhere, while he might pretend to be crazy, he all know that he has his wits about him.The thing is that I don't believe that Phoenix's Joker could actually be the 'clown-prince of crime' because, well, I'm not entirely sure whether he is actually capable of interacting with people, let alone being the calculating criminal that he is famous for. The reason is that he really doesn't seem to be capable of being able to interact with people. In fact, he is more of a symbol, this is something that slowly becomes relevant as the movie progresses, until we get to the end. Of course, the ending is very ambiguous, and some of the suggestions that he is a joker as opposed to The Joker, really doesn't sit with me all that well.However, in a way it sort of makes sense, him being a symbol and all that. One suggestion, and it is a suggestion that I sort can agree with, is that he actually died in the car crash (something that isn't all that surprising considering he was hit by an ambulance on the side of the car in which he was sitting), and the crowds removed him carefully, as if he was some sort of martyr. Sure, the final scene certainly doesn't suggest that he is in heaven or anything, but the thing is that many characters literally take on a force of personality, one in which the actual person could never fulfill, and Arthur is certainly no leader, not in that sense of the word, and as such he can really only exist as a symbol.Yet we must remember that there is so much about this film that we simply do not know what is truth and what is hallucination. The thing is that Arthur is seriously disconnected from reality, that becomes pretty clear with the 'relationship' that he has with the woman down the hallway. Yeah, once that becomes clear, and it should not have been any surprise as all, it really throws into a lot of doubts what is actually happening, what is real and what is not. Then again, there are a lot of scenes going on in the background, which do give us hints that there certainly is a reality that is unfolding, which means that he certainly did kill the three men on the subway, and murdered Murray live on national television.Yet even Thomas Wayne, a character that is certainly not held in such high regard in this film, has an ambiguous side to him. Then again, in the other Batman films, we see so little of the character that he is seen as some angelic figure. Yet in this film, once again, the truth, and the reality, are two completely different things. Still, the whole question of whether he did have an affair with Arthur's mother, and that Arthur is actually his illegitimate son, is certainly thrown into a lot of doubt.So, yeah, this is a pretty awesome film, and it is certainly one of those films that is going to leave you thinking and trying to understand it for quite a while after leaving the cinema. Honestly, it is pretty good that we are starting to see more of these movies come into the cinema now, after a very long drought full of a bunch of quite sub-par action flicks.","10/10"

"Joker","dhunjiwadia","7 February 2020","Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies. This movie is about a character, not action or explosions. Joaquin Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and how power can be obtained. Todd Phillips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every other important aspect of the film. The movie gave me instant 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' vibes, without copying both films. This movie will drag you into your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better joker - Heath or Joaquin? The answer is - both did a phenomenal job. And Joker is fortunate to have being played by two phenomenal actors.

"Joker","cinema_lover97","7 October 2019","I miss Heath Ledger and can't get enough of his portrayal of Joker. He was intimidating, scary, unpredictable and all other things. In 2016, we got Suicide Squad and Jared Leto as Joker both of which disappointed me very much. After that, I thought that I don't want to see another Joker interpretation on the big screen. I was skeptical when I heard that a standalone Joker movie was in works. Then I heard about the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and I developed an interest in it because I love his work. He is a method actor and has given some of my favorite performances for example in Her (2013) and The Master (2012). I decided to see the movie in the theater after hearing a lot about the movie, good and bad and I am glad that I saw it.This movie is really good, it exceeded my expectations and Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his work. He is phenomenal and I was blown away by his performance. His performance alone carries the whole movie and lets you experience and understand the character without saying much. His physique, movements, gestures, grace, way of speaking suggests that he gave his everything to make the character compelling and stand out from other Joker portrayals. He lost 52 pounds for the role. He embodied the character of Joker. Comparing his performance with Heath Ledger will be absurd. There is no common ground for comparison. Both interpretations of Joker are significantly different, the story is different, character motivations are different.Now talking about the story, this is a standalone Joker movie that shows how a man beaten up, neglected and humiliated by the society turns into a maniac. This movie follows Arthur Fleck who works as a party clown and lives with his mother. He wants to be a stand-up comic. He suffers from a condition causing him to laugh uncontrollably. We feel his loneliness, depression, and condition and sympathize with him for it. All the other performances were also very good. This movie isn't that much violent as people are saying it to be, but it makes you feel the violence and it is unsettling. It also allows the viewer to form their perspective about the character. Sometimes you will agree with his actions and sometimes you won't. There are also certain funny scenes in the movie but not everyone may find it funny.The movie is directed by Todd Phillips and he has done an outstanding job. I didn't think that the guy who made The Hangover movies can pull this off, but he did it. He showed that as a filmmaker, he can make more than just R rated comedies. The film is set in 1981 and the period is very well reflected in the movie. The cinematography is top-notch. Shot composition, camera placement, camera movement has been handled well. I was surprised by how good the Gotham city looked, beautiful and dirty at the same time. Each scene had a color scheme. The lights in the surroundings like light from streetlights, cars or the sky illuminated everything with their light. Joker/Arthur Fleck's emotions get conveyed through shades of light falling on him which is beautiful to look at. Music is beautiful, chilling, hypnotizing and speak lengths about the inner feelings of the character.I have just a few issues with the plot of the movie and how some things happen which shouldn't have happened or couldn't have happened, rest the movie is flawless.","4/10"

Is it just hallucinations? Imagination? Is it a dream? Overall. These questions makes the film that more better!Arthur Fleck....
The lower class citizen.The motherly loving son.The low paid clown.That becomes an accidental cult leader.Truly. The best comic book film since The Dark Knight! The Joker is a laughing Masterpiece!","10/10"
"Joker","kemkomacar","29 December 2019","There are tons of reviews focusing on the extraordinary acting of Joaquin Phoenix, so I am skipping that part. I would like to make comments on the heated discussion that whether this movie glorifies the violence.Right off the ""bat"", I think it doesn't. Joker beautifully portrays how villains/monsters emerge and rise to power in a society.The dominant Western culture dictates that being good or bad is a completely personal choice and no society should be blamed for the rotten apples among them. On the other hand, leftist approaches tend to put the blame on the socio-economical structures of a society and they claim that the system produces such abnormalities.This fine piece of art takes a balanced attitude that blends the two extreme wiews summarized above. Arthur was a mentally disturbed person long before emerging as the Joker. He was delusional, depressed, and he had many social anxieties to prevent him of being a functioning member of a society. So, why did he become a villain, among many other troubled people? Because the society he lives in was corrupted and it was causing unrest. Ordinary people were already looking for an icon to channel their rages and discontent towards.So, for a true villain to rise, there must be a perfect combination of personal and sociological conditions. In the absence of psychological troubles, the villain candidate can't go the extra mile and endure such a depraving journey. On the other hand, in the absence of a truly corrupt and disgusting societal background, actions of a villain candidate would be considered unnecessary violent acts and as a result, the masses would not approve him/her. This is one of the main reasons why the people don't embrace lone wolf attacks nowadays. Despite all the problems they have, societies don't need a villain and that's why the villain candidates are mostly labelled as the depraved crazies.To wrap it up, the movie doesn't glorify the violence at all. It demonstrates the psychological and sociological conditions of a villain emerging and being widely accepted by an imaginary society. Actually, it's a free lesson for the policymakers all around the world. If you invest on the mental health of individuals and rule them fairly, the Joker can't be around.","9/10"
"Joker","Wuchakk","15 December 2019","A mentally troubled middle-aged clown (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City goes from not good to worse when he finally realizes his true identity. Robert DeNiro plays a talk show host and Zazie Beetz the friendly girl down the hall. Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce's rich father.""Joker"" (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics' villain, but it's more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain). The movie's captivating from the get-go and practically everything works for a broodingly superb cinematic experience.There are several amusing bits, but this ain't a fun flick. It's heavy and tragic. But what's the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He's a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber's ""Night of the Laughing Dead"" in Man-Thing #5 (1974).The movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).GRADE: A-/A","10/10"
"Joker","constelaciondelyra","6 July 2021","Not sure what others see in this movie. J. Phoenix delivers an amazing performance, yes, but that's basically all this movie has going for it. Ok, the cinematography is good and production values are high. But apart from this, the plot is boring and the references to Batman's universe feel forced. I watch the movie and only see a mentally unstable and sick man getting worse and worse, with a background of social unrest in the city. Also, the Joker was a cunning and cruel villain, so I don't think it's a good choice to make him start as a failed sad clown, where is the intelligence, the ambition? I don't think the clown is the core of this character, but rather a chosen aesthetic that has certain meaning. In summary, I find a disconnection between the character of the Joker in Batman and this guy that we see turning crazy here.","10/10"
"Joker","meanmrslinky","9 October 2019","Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker, in this jaw-dropping masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come. It proves to be more than just a comic book villains backstory. 'Joker' meticulously captures the gradual decline of one man's mental health, and shines light on the subject of mental health in general. There are points where you begin to sympathize with the madman. Despite some of the terrible acts he happily commits, you find yourself rooting for him which leads you to question your own morality. The world has viciously beaten this man down, and this is only the beginning of his retaliation.This is, without a doubt, Phoenix's best performance so far. He carries the entire movie flawlessly, and leaves you with a lot to talk about afterwards. The brilliant method actor ensures that people will feel this characters pain, and does not disappoint for one second. Robert De Diro, another brilliant method actor, gives a fine performance as Aurthor Fleck's favorite comedy talk show host, Murray Franklin. Though he's only in the movie for roughly 10-15 minutes total, he does a very well job at depicting a phony, belligerent, television personality. Brett Cullen also gives a fine performance as the billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, and has a part in Jokers madness.The word 'masterpiece' should never be thrown around lightly. It's a term we use to describe an outstanding, almost perfect, piece of art. There are only so many films that can be considered 'masterpieces'. Rarely do we ever see a flawless movie, especially this day in age. With that being said, it is hard to NOT consider 'Joker' a masterpiece. Every scene is just as important as the next, every actor delivers a wonderful performance, and Todd Phillips does an outstanding job directing the villains transformation. 'Joker' absolutely deserves a 10/10, and nothing short of that. This movie holds a mirror up to society; it should make you question what part society takes in one's slow drift into madness. This is very relevant to today, and is a perfect example of why something like this needs to be addressed and taken seriously. Everyone needs to see this movie. Again, it will be talked about for many years to come, and could very well be considered one of the greatest drama/thrillers of all time.","8/10"
"Joker","davidmax-86392","3 March 2020","Oscar bait with a try-hard message that is obvious at any point. The acting is good but nowhere near perfection. The camera work is good but shows nothing new, the same goes to everything else.
It's ok at best so I'd give it a 4-5 but since everyone treats it as a masterpiece, so will I. Compared to Pulp Fiction, Eraserhead, The Audition, Dances with Wolves, Lone Wolf and Cub, The Dark Knight, Alien etc it's a shaky 2 at best...sorry
If you break it down it's a crazy guy dancing and making funny faces while the message is slapping you in the face.
Nothing artsy about this piece of mainstream cinema.","10/10"
"Joker","Kubrickfan15","8 December 2020","So they stole King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, put it on a comic book character, made a self indulgent snooze fest, and get oscars for it. Only redeeming qualities are the score and the performances. It does what is sets out to achieve, but not without stealing form Scorsese.Edit:
After a rewatch, I drove up the score 2 more stars. The copying is still blatant, but the score, performances, and cinematography are great. Direction is also pretty good. Still overrated.","7/10"
"Joker","blr-btc","2 August 2021","A deep scan of reviews has fans that can understand depression become overwhelmed with empathy. There is a reason for everything, and understanding the context of a nostalgic character like the joker is what works.There was not a faithfulness to the scenes in Batman begins. Police chief introduces him during the outro as someone fairly unknown not a state wide celeb as played out in this film, that break in story continuity ruins it for me.Likewise the reinterpretation of Mr Wayne as something he never was. This takes away from the moral clarity of the pending superhero Batman.The greed narrative feels like its something that was force fed without rhyme or reason. While the joker had a substantial arc, the sub plots did not.Nostalgia is what brings the film to life, there is not many ways to not make money from iconic characters, this film should have been attempted years ago!Over the years Hollywood actors have been applauded for playing villians which is the easiest character study of them all. Whats hard is being protector of the realm without it feeling preachy or cheesy. These roles get a natural upscaling.The main plot element of inviting Arthur onto the talk show was not convincing, the stand up performance was not in the genre of 'so bad its good' his first vision from the audience defending his mother was however powerful and well written.A cameo for Alfred the butler would have been special and really pulled us back into the story.The ways this film was lauded in its first week was ridiculous, it does drag in many places over the 2hr hour screening.All the theatrical trailers were an 8 so many of us expected more. To say this is a better production than Batman Begins is shocking.The difficult reality to bare in this over hyped rating and cultural reality is many people in our age really feel like this and are on the verge of rioting after life takes its toll.The broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes is a great story that can be told a million ways, this was not executed well.The dream sequences worked well but the device was still not as good as Heath Ledgers raw portrayal of a psychopathic megalomaniac and the cinematography of Nolan in related films.Simple plot failures like the police not being able to catch up with Arthur who was not trying to be careful was disappointing and took me right out of the story.A good ensemble of actors can't save a bad script, why was this rushed to production? Something as important as Batman origin stories need much more careful work. I believe over time this score must average out and down.Was this an homage to ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The King of Comedy"" apparently not. The opportunity for genuine franchise building was surprisingly tossed away and will be hard to repair.Critics who use the word 'masterpiece' and
'groundbreaking' need to have a long hard look at themselves, their surroundings and the education that they all seem to share. There is F all diversity in this mob who keep playing us.","10/10"
"Joker","davidec23","18 November 2019","I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get.","6/10"
"Joker","TristanSilya","8 October 2019","Ignore these haters, trust me. They're extremely biased and are simply hating this movie because people like it and because they expect it to be something that it isn't.Things you MUST know before you watch the movie is that this isn't a ""Batman"" movie. It's not an action movie. If you're expecting a ton of action and explosions and a lot happening then this isn't the right movie for you.This movie is a drama. It's a drama about a man named Arthur and how he became ""Joker."" It doesn't really go into details or explore his childhood. The movie is about a very small portion of Arthur's life that happened just right up to before he becomes ""Joker."" The premise is pretty simple and not overly complicated.The reason this movie is loved is because it's beautifully shot and executed. The acting is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the score is chilling, the art and flow is very poetic. This is not a movie you watch with your eyes. This is a movie that you must watch with your mind. It goes deep into the human psyche. It presents simple things in a different light. It dances, literally AND figuratively between light and dark, good and bad, right and wrong. You have to pay attention or you'll miss the message.I enjoyed the movie and I believe it's a type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience. There's a lot of subtle details that are easily missed even if you pay attention.","4/10"
"Joker","mkm-hermanjnr","20 October 2021","I'll be honest, I was avoiding seeing ""Joker"".At first it seemed to me that it was going to be yet another comic book movie in a cinematic landscape saturated to bursting point with bland comic book movies.Then I was a little fed up with the constant tiresome media spam the film was getting because it was so ""controversial"". These events conspired to make me feel less than enthusiastic about watching it.Well, two days ago I changed my mind, put it on and the rest is history.Joker is a phenomenal film. It's such an intriguing in-depth study of mental illness, social inequity and the inability of people of different social classes to understand each other that I was really quite blown away. It's a movie that has far more in common with classic intelligent cinema than modern day CGI-loaded blockbusters.Following mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck, the movie chronicles his heart-wrenching descent into sociopathic villainy, catalysed by the decaying and uncaring social environment of Gotham City.Joaquin Phoenix does a brilliant job here, honestly one of the best acting performances I've ever seen. Arthur can be defined most reliably by one word: ""Pain"".Arthur's entire existence is emotional pain. Almost everyone he meets treats him like garbage. Those who do not treat him poorly still cannot even begin to understand his struggle with mental illness.When he bursts out in sheer frustration to one character, voice cracking, with the line ""I don't know why everyone is so rude? I don't know why you are? I don't want anything from you!"" it hurts, because we've seen the way Arthur is treated and it's absolutely true.Yet at the same time, Arthur's point of view is unreliable and inaccurate. We can understand *why* people treat him poorly - because he is creepy and eccentric without realising. This leads to a masterful dramatic situation in which we completely empathise with Arthur's pain but also understand precisely why this pain becomes a perpetual loop.When Arthur's final singular comfort, his love for his mother, is brutally stripped from him, the end result is one of the most heart-breaking scenes I've seen in a film.The film's pace is slow but with good reason. I was becoming restless with the misery of the first half of the movie, but the final half (and especially the final act) builds to an enormous climax that justifies every ounce of build up that preceded it.My favourite scene in the whole movie is perhaps the most iconic - Arthur in his full ""Joker"" regalia, dancing down the same steps he has struggled to climb up repeatedly throughout the film.This scene works on so many levels to highlight the most horrifying aspect of the film - Arthur's mental salvation, his total liberation, in the end does not come from positivity. It does not come, as in the case of a ""coming of age"" movie, from fixing his problems and becoming happy.No, Arthur's charisma, happiness and total lack of concern in his new persona comes from suicidal ideation and a complete lack of care for anything. His problems finally break his sanity completely, to the point where happiness and sadness don't mean anything to him anymore. The man dancing merrily down the steps has lost his soul, and he's smiling about it.I won't say anymore about the film for risk of spoiling it for those who have not seen it. But I will end this review by saying that the entire hysterical media response to this movie and how it will ""encourage violence"" is utter nonsense.Joker has the complete opposite message: understand the people around you. Show them compassion, even if they seem unworthy of it on the surface. Don't judge others based on their social status or what you see on TV. And above all, realise that your opinion of others is based off your experience and limited knowledge, and isn't necessarily accurate.Perhaps that's the true reason why mass media outlets dislike this film. Because it encourages developing the virtues the modern reactionary media seems to lack.","9/10"

"Joker","BobbyGuts","7 October 2019","Overall Great movie!!! (writing, direction, acting)
I am excited to see if it's strength raises the bar for newer releases.
It's plot sings the blues of the jokers story and does so with nostalgic aesthetics- combining ""Taxi driver"" psycology with a ""King of Comedy"" theme (Coincidently two movies starring De Niro & directed by Scorsese).
The emphasis was heavy on the mental illness and misfortunes of Arthur Fleck but unexplored were the entertaining/ musicality traits of a joker.
The playfulness that was expressed through the character seemed more-so of Joaquin Phoenix and less in the spirit of Joker.
Throughout the movie the Joker is portrayed as self conscious and the resolution/ climaxed rebellion is an out-cry from that- not so much on his real connection to Gotham or a villainous reign.
That said I don't see this Joker bright enough to be an infamous, self sustaining, street-wise villain.","10/10"
"Joker","Tushpi","8 January 2020","I'm blown away by Joaquin Phoenix's performance. He totally inhabits the persona . I couldn't tear my eyes away. Mesmerising.

The movie is absorbing and disturbing. The violence makes an impact would being too gory. You could read a lot of symbolism into the the movie. A parable of our times? I just let it wash over and immerse me.

"Joker","armin-durakovic","11 February 2020","I have to say that I'm a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix and I can say that he really nailed it while playing Joker. Movie, itself, is very emotional, but for my taste, a bit to slow. The drama kicks in at times, but it feels like the movie is lacking something. Maybe it's my subjective point of view, since most people like to say that it's the best movie of 2019, but I think it's a bit exaggerated.
Still, I think it's worth to see it. The movie has great cinematography, plot is great, acting from De Niro is also worth mentioning, the score and the screenplay are great, too, still I think I seen better movies last year :)","8/10"
"Joker","stefstars","7 October 2019","Wow ! I'll be honest that I did not expect this one to live up to the hype, but it did. We've been overdue on having a proper masterpiece film out there and this one delivers. A movie that causes you to think and still leaves you thinking about why those events happened in the film or even real life. Leaves you thinking about why it's important to know both sides of a situation - of course this is a lesson that the Batman lore has always had, hence the villains having interesting backstories. There's so much to take in with this film, did you ever expect that from a comic book movie ? Much less a DC film ?! Batman has always been (to me at least) the most interesting story in the comic book world, because the villains are as interesting (if not more) than the hero. So many film adaptations have been made, but this one finally does an outstanding job exploring the story's most complex character. Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise for his take on this character. He got the mannerisms, looks, and ticks of a mentally unstable person down to a T, it's so natural and not cheesily forced - the guy is phenomenal. Whether people like it or not, we needed this film. No matter if you're part of the overly sensitive brigade that censors everything or an online edgelord who mocked this film for critiquing sOciEty, you need to watch this film - there's a valuable lesson in it for both of you. This is one of the greatest films that has come out in this decade. Congrats to the whole team who made it possible, outstanding job !","10/10"

"Joker","Ashcropolis","8 October 2019","Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we face today in the world. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur gu√∞nad√≥ttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say.","1/10"

"Joker","donaldricco","10 January 2020","Well, I didn't like that they changed the origin story of the main character, and within that, the origin story of Batman. I liked the originals. And, for one and a half hours, this film felt like it was ""beating a dead horse"" - Arthur is mentally ill, in a desperate time, with no more social services. And he's slipping into madness. Pause, repeat, repeat, for nearly 90 minutes. It's dark and traumatic, but its also boring, at that length. Phoenix does a good job of it, sort of combining Buffalo Bill from ""Silence of Lambs"" with the emaciated body of Trevor Reznik from ""The Machinist"", and to good effect, but no one could have kept that up in an interesting manner for that long.The last half hour is better, and lays a solid foundation for how the Joker gains power, almost despite himself. His look, and his laugh, turn more to the classic version of the character and has more of the feel of the Joker I grew up with. But, I don't know that I'd watch this again, and certainly not as often as I've re-watched ""The Dark Knight"" since it came out. This almost might have been a better movie if it wasn't about the Joker at all, and just about some how some crazy man came to be and came to power. Knock, knock...","9/10"

I don't understand that at all, those people to me only wanted an action movie as they apparently didn't have the intelligence to understand a psychological thriller like this. As I stated, this wasn't trying to be an action movie, it wanted to show the Jokers transformation from harmless crazy guy down the street to full on psychotic criminal kingpin. I don't think this is really a major spoiler, but I loved how we were able to see young Bruce Wayne's story unfold in the background as well! I told my sister when we talked about a sequel that if she wanted to know what happens next, go straight to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, then you'll be able to watch two brilliant performances in a row as the Joker, (You were awesome, too, Bale, but this is about the Joker- lol). and basically see the whole story of his life in those two movies. But, that's not to say I'm not onboard with a Joker sequel! I think this is in the running, if not the front runner, for my best movie if the year, but I'll have to sit down and have a look at all the others I've seen! Awesome flick!","2/10"
"Joker","kane_1371-117-231060","6 October 2019","This movie is an intense dive into our dysfunctional societies that has taken a turn for the worse.
To think the director behind such absurd film like Due Date and Hangover (Not that anything is wrong with those films) would even be willing to make this film in itself is amazing.
Joker puts our ugly side under the spotlight and makes you wonder where does a society draw the line.
Those that have watched the Swedish film The Square know that this is a concept that many film makers have worked on for so many years.
Joker is just the darkest side of this story and question.
this line the I am talking about is not the line of justifying the character of Joker but the line that eventually leads to making a person like Joker come to life.
This movie constantly paints that picture, where is the line?
Where do you put a stop to it?
How could you have prevented this from happening?
The movie opens with a clearly already broken man prisoner to the society and the system that is not willing or able to help him.
Joker's situation is already beyond dire and further down the line you learn about all the happenings that lead to this broken man.
The film maker and the actor never paint a heroic picture of Joker, he is not glorified by the movie.
He is presented as the byproduct of a society that is eerily familiar.
Because whether we like it or not we all are responsible for one another.
We all affect each other's lives in ways that we can never imagine and psychological health is to this day a subject that is scoffed at even by the brightest and most free thinking people.
No one likes to see where the monster comes from because we do not want to have the blaming finger turned on us.
We just want the monster among us shunned, chained and caged and hanged.
It is a fact that our failing societal relationships are leading to psychological illnesses and in extreme cases to violent outbursts.
Most of these outbursts are introvert and almost nobody pays any attention to them but the extrovert ones are always scoffed at when doctors talk about the need to study and understand them.
This is the world that creates Joker which is portrayed and criticized here.
Leaving that subject behind lets talk about Joaquin Phoenix.
This man is a wonder.
I have followed his work through out the years watching him as he evolved with every movie he played and today when you watch Joaquin play Joker you see him through out his career.
You see him in Gladiator, you see him in Ladder 49, you see him in Her.
He has grown with every movie to the point where he creates this amazingly authentic performance for the audience to take part in.
From the very first line, the mimicry, the slightest movement he is the character that he is portraying and he is Joker by the end of the movie.
You can hear this pained and sick man, you can see his break point, you can feel his struggles and that makes this performance just exceptional.
I am not going to even compare this performance, it really is an entirely different beast and by far one of the best performances I have seen in the recent years and easily the best Joker performance to this day.
Lets go into the music...what can be said except intense?
Something that I loved was the music choices, they really did convey the world's personality to me as audience.
From the jazzy tones of the New York city life (as we know Gotham is basically New York and Chicago mixed into an unholy union) to the musics chosen to deliver the mood of the scene or character it felt really fitting and good.
Then we come to the original sound track and we are basically dealing with a drama horror or thriller soundtrack with suspenseful moments and intense moments that makes you sit straight in wait for the impending explosion of events.
This is Joker, every camera shot, every movement and every sound is there to make you wait for the right moment that it goes ""BANG"" and puts something new on your lap and this movie has several of those.
This is Joker, a movie that studies what elements in a society can lead to the creation of people like Joker and Batman and in my humble opinion this movie delivered on this at every front possible.
I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie to anyone that is a fan of Cinema and good films in general.","10/10"

"Joker","shirjil","31 August 2019","Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.
Clearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed ""Fear City.""This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself ""God's lonely man"" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.
The Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.","10/10"
"Joker","aweynand96","7 October 2019","The people have hoisted this movie high onto a pedestal - and those that haven't have grabbed their pitchforks. This film has arrived during a bewildering time in our country and the world at large, a time when shootings feel more prevalent than ever and months-long protests in Hong Kong have gained international recognition. Given the context, and the importance of the pivotal movement occurring in the new Joker movie's Gotham, some have claimed the film promotes not just protest, but violent protest. I think that's blasphemy. Sometimes, a movie is just a movie. Controversy has been a staple of some dynamic proportion of new films since the dawn of moving pictures, and that doesn't always mean the message is supposed to invoke violence from the masses. Keeping this in mind - and thus watching Todd Phillip's ""Joker"" as entertainment and not an invitation to anarchy - I can say honestly that it was an absolute blast.Nobody is surprised that Joaquin Phoenix was up for taking on the role. He's a phenomenal actor with an impressive range; just watch him play Freddie Quell in 2012's ""The Master"" and then Theodore in 2013's ""Her"" and try to deny his scope of talent. What is surprising is just how enrapturing and satisfying his performance as Arthur Fleck turned out to be. Whatever misgivings you may have about the eruption of violence that occurs around his version of the Joker, Phoenix absolutely elevates this movie, and is impossible (almost to a fault, but not quite) to look away from him. He plays a broken man with a damaged past, and is so completely engrossing, so stunningly bleak, that it makes the film worth watching, and then watching again. Without spoiling anything, I can assure you that his arc is a triumph to behold, and I was clinging to every devilish smile, shocking moment, and chilling laugh that flashed across the screen. He's not trying to kick off an uprising for political gain; he just wants to share his bafflement of society's awfulness with the rest of the world.Okay, so the performance was master-class, but was the film a masterpiece? Not in my opinion; the theme of rising discontent with the rich and/or powerful is an old one, and it's beaten with a ham fist at times here. But damn if it isn't difficult to admit that given how gripping and show-stopping the titular character turned out to be. And though he's the best part of the movie by a long-shot, he's not the only great thing that ""Joker"" has going for it. The film is interwoven with a harrowing score written by the same composer that worked on ""Arrival"", ""Sicario"" and ""Chernobyl"", and the music manages to pierce the air at all the right moments, heightening the intensity where it is appropriate and pinning suspense for as long as we can stand it. I have no complaints about the rest of the cast because they are all great (and would you guess this is Robert De Niro's highest grossing opening ever?). The movie is indeed dark, at times nihilistic and very often just bleak, but Phoenix screams ""NUTS to that"" and revels in the blackness as his tragedy-turned-comedy character transforms into a cackling murderer.The critics have complaints: That Joaquin Phoenix was trying too hard, and that the themes were overt and annoyingly crass. I'd like to point out that acting your heart out isn't always trying too hard, and trying too hard doesn't always make you a great actor anyways. While his performance certainly does not feel effortless, I never once rolled my eyes - I was captivated. As for the heavy-handed ""message"", I say please - this is still a comic book movie. I'm not sure what you expected.7.5/10 for the best performance of 2019 in a Cedar Point thrill of a film.","6/10"
"Joker","blackmamba99971","17 July 2020","It's not every year that an actor can get to the top with a unique role. Playing the fictional character the Joker has been tried for many decades by various actors but the closest one to the original was Heath Ledger who won an oscar for the role. Now, it's Joaquin who has taken the lead. A disenchanted individual who tries to cope with life as it hands out grime and dirt in its most ruthless form, starts to take it's toll on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin) who was adopted by his disillusioned mother who suffered severe psychiatric problems. Stemmed with endless turmoil in Gotham, Arthur begins to realize what life has to offer. Yet none of it gives Arthur a sense of relief except when he kills starting with three thugs on a subway line. From then on, his mind clears away the hazy images that his medications blocked him with, to advance further and further into his own existential madness.
I found this version of the Joker to be very gratifying, especially as Joaquin nailed the comic clown's persona to a perfect 'T'. Becoming Gotham's crown prince of crime in upsetting the natural order of things as we see it normally. Such as politics, monetary issues, or just living day to day in a world of chaos brimming with upheaval and despair that surrounds us all. Director, Todd Phillips was brilliant in showing us the gritty, dirty streets laced with crime in all corners. Not just the for the elite, but for all levels of humans who want to escape but can't for reasons of either insanity or just plain nostalgia that all people relate to when they move into a new corner of the world.
It is a clear reminder that for the most part, people from all walks of life can only stand so much criticism when they do their jobs, or need to be recognized for their value or contributions to society. When such acts of decadence leaks inward to affect the common man, then the little things begin to build incrementally until it reaches the point of critical mass.
Todd Phillips captured this brilliantly. The music was an incredible match using the early era of the seventies and eighties as a catalyst to the Joker's rise to fame. It helped his madness, it helped mould his persona into the devious creature that helped purge out the elite to their own wasteland while at the same time, had given birth to the Batman. This was an incredible movie, from start to finish. Lots of emotional turmoil, sadness, mind bending plots as to why Arthur plunged into the abyss of chaos. I recommend this film to all fans of the Joker franchise. It doesn't hold a lot of violence, but when it's needed, Phillips delivered perfectly to balance the story's theme.","10/10"

"Joker","krocheav","7 August 2020","How easily pleased have some people become? When a 'major' movie is this simplistic and obviously just another copy of many other overrated downers - it leaves someone needing to explain how this nonsense then goes on to rate a ridiculous 11 Oscar nominations? Who can truly take the Oscars seriously any longer? Joker is a typical super-ugly, comic book R Rated serial killer story - which grinds its endless way through non-stop, grotesque situations of the most maudlin kind. We've already seen this character (somewhat over-played by Phoenix) far too many times in the past. Even the dark, sleazy settings don't invite interest, and has left many viewers wanting it all to end quickly but no, it drags on for over two hours, feeling painfully more like three.Then there's the casting of an over-used De Niro, intended to help capitalise on some of those 'gangster- obsessed' Scorsese offerings. Many paid to see this over-hyped lowbrow tosh, expecting to experience a masterpiece - only to wish they could get back their time and money for better use.If uninspired morbidity is your thing, you'll get a bellyful - otherwise, stay well away and watch this junk fade into the obscurity it deserves, hopefully, along with the copycat movie makers. The final images this movie creates of carnage on the streets of America, looks more like the sorry, robotic BLM mayhem that's reducing the USA to a decaying mess. Just what the CCP and others would be quite happy to see - Civil War. Such a pitiful shame and a sick joke.","1/10"

"Joker","CineMuseFilms","28 December 2019","If you have been avoiding the movie Joker (2019) because you think it belongs to the superhero genre and the violent world of masked crusaders then you are making a mistake. Just like I did. Set aside preconceptions and see what is one of the most powerfully introspective portraits of mental illness you will ever find on film - and Batman is nowhere to be seen.Set in Gotham City in the recent pre-digital age, the story opens with Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to live a normal life, hold a job, and care for his ageing mother. Abused as a child, he relies on medication for his cocktail of mental disorders, the most prominent of which is a condition where anxiety can trigger bursts of hysterical laughter (Pseudobulbar Affect). City Hall cuts back on support services and Arthur's untreated conditions escalate as he becomes more vulnerable to abuse, loses his job, and his dream of becoming a stand-up comic is cruelly exploited. With nothing to gain or lose, all that is left is vengeance.
This plotline is merely a narrative framework for what is a phenomenal performance by Phoenix. His chiselled features, balletic body language, and elastic facial contortions have extraordinary power to express disconnectedness from the material world. As he endures the torments of an uncaring society, we become immersed in his value system where violence makes perfect sense.The film was always going to generate controversy for its depiction of violence. However, it remains on the 'art' side of gratuitous and is more restrained than so many other violent but non-controversial films. The soundtrack and cinematography are edgy, and the camerawork is often so close to Arthur you can see the pores of his skin sweating fury at those around him. The film is visually engrossing: the sets ooze gothic decay, dystopian chaos, and streets full of vagrants and the dispossessed. The film's two-hour running time feels like one.Phoenix single-handedly drives this film and he deserves critical acclaim. It was risky to bypass the usual magical fantasy of super-heroes and super-villians and take a serious look at a serious issue. Entertainment can be a powerful platform for education. While the script retains the tropes of Marvel Comics, it shows insight into mental illness with lines like ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? What you deserve"".","9/10"

If you're expecting your typical comic book-y Joker vs Batman, good vs evil kind of thing you will be disappointed.

Joker is a flawless movie, by far the greatest masterpiece of 21st century, and I am expecting at least one Oscar. And if it gets a sequel as good as this, that sequel deserves Oscar too.

"Joker","azathothpwiggins","11 February 2020","JOKER is astounding and confrontational. It covers issues like mental illness, class warfare, guns, societal breakdown, etc., while presenting a ""villain"" in Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who is as sympathetic as he is terrifying. Filled with uncomfortable, even shocking moments, as well as unsettling comedic elements, some scenes will make many viewers squirm!Arthur is the overlooked, dismissed ""nobody"", forced to believe he doesn't even exist. He's a man in desperate need of help. Unfortunately, Gotham city isn't the place to find it. As his mind begins to shatter, Arthur has no idea what's coming his way. He simply finds his strength in a sudden act of violence, and somehow taps into the void within those around him, ultimately becoming a sort of messiah.The mesmerizing Mr. Phoenix uses his body as much as his dialogue to bring both Arthur and his alter ego to life. This is a movie to be watched and taken seriously, in spite of its comic book origins. It's as much a serious statement as it is entertainment. Multiple viewings recommended...","7/10"
"Joker","Jamarama97","7 October 2019","Just to say that the film left me wanting to watch ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"" the whole time, plus a few of the other films that this film strongly references. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic however and the film has all the top production values that you'd expect of a big studio picture but it's generic and predicable in my opinion. It takes from so much that it's not it's own film for me. By no means is the film awful, it's just soulless. I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse and against the tide of support for this film either, there are things as I've mentioned to commend and I'd like to add that going the way of gritty R rated film making is what I've wanted for years, from a more dramatic viewpoint, I thought ""Logan"" did what this film failed to do for me as a darker comic book oriented film. I hope people can respect my opinion just as I respect the free speech of everyone who really liked the film. Finally, I will add that those who have bashed the film for violence do not know what they're talking about. There are far more violent films than this and if one person or even a handful of people were incentivised to cause harm to others, the rest of us shouldn't have to pay for the odd few thank you very much. It's an interesting watch for certain and I'd recommend watching for that reason alone.","10/10"

"Joker","harryplinkett14","4 March 2020","Characters that suffer abuse can be a good element in a plot. But audience should never suffer abuse. The audience needs to experience catharsis in the end. And this never happens with 'Joker'. The film has a huge problem, which it never manages to solve: it wants to be realistic and tell the tale of an innocent, abused individual who snaps; but it also wants to exist within a fictional universe in which this man is as much of an abuser as he is a victim. And this creates problems for the screenwriters that they never manage to solve. Thus Joker comes across as a sympathetic character first, but turns to a vicious killer towards the end, at which point everyone becomes confused, and stops liking him. There is no redemption of any kind, no satisfying emotional resolution, only a brutal ending which serves the purposes of the wider franchise and doesn't deliver on its own terms. In the end, the character we were made to empathize with becomes nothing but a caricature in a silly superhero universe. And that is an insult to anyone who invested in the character from the beginning. The audience is cheated. Also, one should note the disturbing anarchist/communist vibe in the film - the idea that it's better to burn down the world than allow their particular understanding of 'injustice' to go on. I may pity Joker and hate the cynical Wayne, but I won't put degenerate, mentally ill clown in charge of an angry mob that wants to burn everything down.","10/10"

(9.5/10)I was close to giving this movie a ten out of ten, but then I thought to myself is it wrong for me to think that Joker is brilliant and unsettling all in one? Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself.
""I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,"" whispers Arthur, who's also on seven different types of medication and has been in the system for most of his life. A system that now has no resources or time for him. A desperate whisper that you know won't be heard by anyone. That simply signifies the beginning of both a descent and his path to becoming the Joker. This is ultimately what Joker is: an origin story. One that touches only ever so lightly on what has come before in the DC Universe. This could, particularly in the current climate, be viewed as a lament for outsiders and the ignored. That's too simple and Joker does anything but deliver you easy answers. It's a sad, chaotic, slow-burn study of someone who isn't visible; who doesn't even exist to the world around them. But your empathy, sympathy even, isn't guaranteed, and it begins to dissolve as Arthur somehow moves even further to the edges. This is, we mustn't forget, the story of how a villain was made.
As Arthur/Joker, Joaquin Phoenix is astonishing. Phillips has said he had a picture of the actor above his screen when writing the script and it's a belief that has paid off. Phoenix inhabits Arthur: having lost weight for the role, he looks thin, frail, hungry. Shadows carve out his exposed bones. His physicality is precise, the way he moves, shuffles, runs, sits, smokes, shrinks. His usual intensity is on full display and it's captivating, even overwhelming in moments. While this is Phoenix's film, Frances Conroy is quietly devastating as Arthur's mother Penny, and Zazie Beetz, as neighbour Sophie Dumond, while arguably underused, brings vital humanity to her scenes with Arthur. The most talked-about piece of casting was obviously Robert De Niro as late-night TV host Murray Franklin.
Mention must be made of Joker's cello score by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir: mournful, dark and fractured, and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher. In his hands, Gotham is alive as a flawed, brutal, broken-hearted character in its own right.
Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.","6/10"

Joker just so happens to be glorius yet horrifyingly realistic depiticion of the various ""what ifs"" in our dysfunctional world. Granted, this film is a origin story of one of the most beloved antagonists in cinema and comic book history, however, the film also holds a very vital meaning in its delivery. With the help of a Joaquin Phoenix career defining performance, we are able to see the slow dip into insanity of the average man who'd be the least expected to morph into a monstrous villain by the hand of society, caused by neglection. Todd Phillips is a damn genius, and again proves to us that a comedic mind can also hold the most grim ideas. He most certainly proves this by delivering the fun additives, which would be the clever use of violence that is more artsy than controversial (people exaggerate so much it sickens me), a discomforting atmosphere that leaves you feeling the anxiety you never knew you could feel; like watching Taxi Driver times 5, and an ending that you never knew a third act could pull off so masterfully, it becomes more unforgettable than one could imagine. Joker has easily, and most effortlessly, claimed the throne of Movie of the Year.Verdict: Joker is the masterpiece we all knew it would be.

"Joker","perica-43151","5 October 2019","There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a bad faith defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their charade might get uncovered. Joker might be delusional, but it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.
But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.
When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypocrites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is.","1/10"
"Joker","omkar1984","4 October 2019","A film with a laudable performance by Phoenix. The film highlights several unpleasant aspects:
1. The PBA disturbance which I doubt the masses(which includes me) are aware of and the traumatic life such a person may lead
2. The effects of the lack of medication for such a disturbance or the effectiveness of such medicines, in first place
3. The never-ending saga of bullying
4. The general insensitivity of the media and talk show hosts.The background score of the movie is good but is an overkill.The screenplay of the movie, the themes and the in general the origin story/retrofit is not only unconvincing and flawed but also seems to deliver a wrong message.
1. The obsession of linking Joker/Fleck to the Wayne family - Fleck's mother's history, Wayne Enterprise employees beating up Fleck and finally the ideological assassination of the Wayne family by a protester
2. Fleck being adopted and having suffered childhood abuse is such a lame and clich√©d plot aspect used by the writers
3. Plausible:
Lack of medication, disturbing discoveries and sort of revenge causes Fleck to go on a killing spree and even enjoying the attention that he receives unexpectedly
Implausible:
Social commentary by Fleck on the show, his sudden liking to riots and chaos. I couldn't believe that they send a detective/psychiatrist to meet Fleck in jail but she's unaware of his disorder and thinks that a PBA-suffering Fleck is laughing at some joke!! Seriously? Are the police and other agencies do dumb to not investigate history of such a criminal?
4. While it's unfair to go into too much of details, I don't understand how a person who likes to dance and become a stand-up comedian would end up having a predilection and some talent in chemical weapons, dynamite, explosives etc. Which are Joker's speciality? Is the viewer supposed to assume that the Fleck cultivates these skills from scratch after he turns into 'Joker'?
5. Last but the most important point - Joker, as we know since ages, is a class-I psychopath who feels no remorse or emotions and enjoys killings and chaos. While such psychopaths get a bit influenced by their surroundings, they are genetically/pathologically having some issues that makes them what they are. In this movie, they somehow try to come up with a cocktail of reasons that give rise to Joker. The worse part is the that riots, vandalism and criminal activities are portrayed as a natural outcome of expressing your discontent.Overall, the movie is a poor origin story of an iconic psychopath like Joker. Watch it as an independent psychological thriller but not as a 'Rise of Joker' film.","10/10"

"Joker","ryanphelantv","26 September 2019","Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come. This is less ""The Dark Knight"" and more ""Taxi Driver"" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves.","9/10"

With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.","7/10"

I admit that it's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker, but it's still awesome. The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called ""THE Joker"". The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in ""The Dark Knight"", but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2","8/10"
"Joker","zkonedog","14 October 2019","After seeing the credits roll on ""Joker"", it took me a bit to figure out my exact feelings towards it. On one hand, there is nothing inherently bad about the film, and it certainly is a new/fresh way to examine that character's backstory mythos. On the other hand, however, there is also a thought that nagged me which said that something was a bit ""off"" about the whole thing. The conclusion I've come to is that while ""Joker"" is a legitimate take on his origins, it just isn't the #1 (or even #2) take that I prefer.For a basic overview, this film focuses on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring stand-up comedian who works as an entertaining clown to support himself. Arthur clearly also has some some of mental illness, including the propensity for laughter when the emotional situation does not call for it. The combination of all these factors sees Fleck mistreated or put down by society at nearly every step of his Gotham-dwelling existence. After perpetuating a subway murder and then being embarrassed on live television by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the late-night talk show host he idolizes, Fleck transforms himself into the tragically comedic figure Batman fans know well.I actually have more respect than most, I think, towards the validity of this ""take"" on The Joker. It is easily the most gritty and true-to-life that has ever been attempted at this point. Basically, WB and director Todd Phillips are saying ""here is how a real-life Joker figure could spring up"", right down to explaining the makeup and predilection towards uncontrollable laughter. In and of itself, there really isn't anything ""wrong"" with this take.That being said, I still prefer Ledger's mysterious Joker of ""The Dark Knight"" or even Nicholson's mob-leader Joker of ""Batman (1989)"". Acting performances strictly aside for the moment, I just don't know about--and feel a little uncomfortable with--the Joker being a tragic figure. I prefer the comic-book approach of Nicholson falling into the vat of chemicals, or the air of mystery surrounding where exactly Ledger's Joker came from. Having this Phoenix Joker spring from a place of potential sympathy? However legitimate that take may be, I just don't like it as much.There are also a few frustrating choices that hold back the overall story of the film:
-A subplot involving Arthur's neighbor down the hall (played by Zazie Beetz) goes absolutely nowhere and ends up meaning very little.
-The shoehorning of the Wayne family into the movie. Did we really need to see the Waynes murder again?! That's becoming a parody of itself at this point. Plus, scenes that feature Fleck and any member of the Wayne family feel like pandering to the Batman crowd rather. The cherry on top, of course, is the insinuation (true or false) that Fleck may actually be a Wayne family relation. Again, that's taking the ""easy way out"" when it comes to crafting this story.Fortunately, ""Joker"" does enough things right to make it watchable. It isn't boring by any means, the music and overall production value is great, and Phoenix does give a great performance. For the tone of the character that Phillips is trying to create, Phoenix is marvelous, actually.Overall, though, I only moderately enjoyed this take on the Joker mythos. Maybe, had this been the first attempt at doing so, I'd feel differently. But as it stands, it comes down to me liking other interpretations of the character more than this one.","6/10"
"Joker","colimexadrian","4 October 2019","Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.","4/10"
"Joker","CinemaClown","10 October 2019","Put on a happy face and smile coz with Joker, the greatest comic-book supervillain at last gets his very own origin story, and it is exactly how it must be: Dark, bleak, deranged, manic, wretched & downright nihilistic. Also, with no good to counter the evil this time around, it is a full-on descent into madness & hysteria that viewers are either gonna detest or embrace wholeheartedly.Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, this standalone take on the origins of the iconic arch nemesis attempts to create his psychological profile by painting a grisly portrait of an unstable mind that's hanging by a thread on the edge of insanity until he finally snaps. Discarding the existing blueprint of its genre, this reincarnation of Joker offers a low-budget, grounded treatment but with hugely rewarding dividends.Though Phillips' direction could dig into Joker's unhinged persona to only a certain extent, Joaquin Phoenix's chilling rendition of the eponymous psychopath bridges the gap and overcomes the few nitpicks with thrilling intensity, for he is gripping & breathtaking throughout. Other vital inputs come from the story's nihilistic tone & treatment, its grim atmosphere, sudden brutal violence, and Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's haunting score.Scarier than most horror films of today, Joker bestows the notorious madman with an origin story that's as plausible as it is cold & callous, and makes for an insanely riveting character study that works even if one strips the premise off its comic book roots. Driven by Joaquin Phoenix's powerful, unsettling & memorable performance, this cautionary tale of a psychotic who in search for identity mistakenly becomes a symbol is arguably the best film of the year.","8/10"

"Joker","begob","3 February 2020","In a city seething with class antagonism, the mental illness of a struggling clown flourishes into messianic and murderous insanity.Woah! That's a bold story, and the lead role does it justice, as the character becomes a sort of hall-of-mirrors reprise of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, with uncanny poses and dance moves. And of course, de Niro is present too, with shades of The King Of Comedy.But you can see the problem right there, with all the emphasis on the actors and not so much on story or theme. It is engaging, and well paced and edited, but a bit linear and simplistic. Maybe comic book heroes are fit only for comic books, and expecting them to take on the injustices of the American Way is to ask too much. At least they had the guts to go for it.On reflection, I think maybe the concept started in too low a gear - if you state that we live in a crazy, mixed-up system, the audience is already with you. What we really want to see is the dawning of the Age of Joker, as the mantra Life Is A Joke infects everything, even the most innocent thing, until we realise Joker is an inevitable outgrowth of the jokers who run this system.The sound is very good, with a constant hubbub of tinny TVs, the guy in the apartment upstairs shouting, ""Shut up!"", and the din of Gotham's chaotic streets. Also, the music keeps reminding you of Sinatra's genius for hitting unexpected notes that are just right. Most interesting part of the cinematography is the giant architecture.Overall: Interesting, not awesome.ps. The best line is a clever gag nicked from Bob Monkhouse: ""When I was growing up I told them I wanted to become a comedian. They laughed at me then ....""","1/10"

"Joker","bilmoo","5 October 2019","There is no doubt in my mind that Joaquin Phoenix deserves at least an Oscar nod, if not the trophy itself. In an odd way, he reminded me of Sean Penn in that when you watch him, you forget he is an actor, all you see is the character. In reality, the rest of the cast were merely props in this one-man show... even Robert De Niro.There are a lot of Easter Eggs as nods to other films of the late 70s and early 80s, which was cool.As an origin story in the comic book universe, Joker was good, better than most. I do not judge movies based on how closely they follow a book or if they follow the rules of physics, but more if they entertain me and allow me to escape my reality for a few hours. In that sense, Joker left me wanting for more. Yeah, there are political nods that you can read into this, but they weren't forced onto the viewer, more of a backdrop.The randomness of Joker's thinking and thoughts was in a word, distracting. Because the director put me in the lead character's psychosis, I had a hard time sympathizing with any character in the movie, which makes it difficult to connect to the story.Maybe the real genius of the movie was that randomness, seeing the world through the psychotic mind of the Joker. But it didn't make for a hugely entertaining experience for me.","9/10"

"Joker","grantss","4 October 2019","Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say ""Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman"", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though.","10/10"
"Joker","MisterJxroen","24 December 2019","When I first saw the 'Joker' in ""The Dark Knight"" I fell in love with the character, because of his somewhat correct motives and the way he thinks. I had never seen a character like him before in any movie, which made it so new and refreshing to watch. When the ""Joker"" movie was announced I was stunned. Especially when I noticed Joaquin Phoenix was going to take on the role of the Joker. An actor that in my opinion is one of the greatest - if not the best - performers of the 20th century. Sr. Phoenix is so good at taking on roles that most people wouldn't want to take on because of how horrifying, haunting or psychologically difficult they are. As someone who absolutely loved Heath Ledger (may he rest in peace) as the Joker, I was extremely curious about Joaquin's performance when I was waiting in the theater for the movie the start.I was not disappointed, not at all. Sr. Phoenix performed beyond my expectations. To me it felt like Joaquin actually transformed 'himself' into the character which gave the personage a very realistic and terrifying touch. The story allowed this character to feel even more real, by placing him in a world that could - if not already - be real and making him face obstacles that people might actually be facing daily. As if there is a deeper message and meaning behind the story. It is very difficult to describe my thoughts on this movie, but that's what so great about it. It allows you to think for yourself.At the end of the movie, every single person in the theater probably thought of a different ending or reason for certain key points in the film. It wasn't just a casual ""good guy bad guy"" story, not at all. I enjoyed it a lot, I will enjoy it many more times and I highly recommend you to give it a shot as well if you haven't yet - because it might just change your whole perspective on cinematography and the story (or one of many) of the Joker.","8/10"
"Joker","xvubojypasyhwurhxkedivvr","27 October 2019","I was seriously not interested in that movie after watching some clowns roaming about in the trailer - I'm getting tired of the redundant Purge movies' characters, you know ; and I'm not enjoying the new trend of blurring the lines between good and evil (e.g. Maleficent, 2019). I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when some friends opted for watching it, and I was baffled!The movie was nothing I had expected it to be. It is actually what a Joker backstory should be like. It is believable, intriguing and down to earth. It is really what you can call an adaptation. Todd Phillips manages to make you feel the darkness in Gotham and how it roves through the city in search of the next victim. The whole Batman universe is thus successfully explained. And Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in the role of the Joker.This movie is not really for the usual Batman fan in search of fantasy, fight scenes and high-tech accessories, but for the pragmatic moviegoers who can enjoy watching a masterpiece just like others enjoy French cuisine in a 5-starred restaurant - I'm not kidding!

"Joker","ElMaruecan82","14 October 2019","Todd Philips' ""Joker"" has spread so many comments and controversy that I don't know exactly where to stand. The film reminded critics of Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and while Joaquin Phoenix' performance channeled the inner angst and alienation that drove the driver Bickle to an extreme -and bloody- corner, I found so many other sources of inspiration that if anything, ""Joker"" is the best tribute to the New Hollywood period.I found ""Network"" in the film, ""Death Wish"", references to ""The King of Comedy"", Marty's underrated movie about a man who wished to exist through the only talent he felt being endowed with... and naturally, there's something of ""A Clockwork Orange"" in the obscene stylishness the Joker embraces his new persona with. In a way, that the film met with controversy is logical, you can't make a social comment about violence and its dangerous appeal by sugarcoating it, violence like its enemies, use symbols and slogan, in fact, revolt is a mask that violence uses to operate undercover or is it the opposite? ""Joker"" is the slap today's audiences needed and that it used the Joker mask in our superhero era makes it even more relevant and accessible. But truth be said, any controversy the film should stir mustn't distract from the real deal.Indeed, any viewer familiar with one tenth of Phoenix' filmography knows the actor's ability to portray enigmatic and troubled characters with a dark side barely hidden, but even with that in mind it's impossible not to be blown away by his performance and compelled by his suffering. He shouldn't be the dark horse of the awards season but the frontrunner because his performance is so rich, so powerful, so intense and so bizarre and grotesque in a captivating way that it's almost like watching a movie within a movie, as if his distortable face was the operation theatre to his acting force, as if his nervous smile slowly turning into cries made a true symphony of pathos and anger. That actor is a treasure to Hollywood and here he's given the kind of rangy performances that can't do without earning awards. His snubbing would be controversy material if you asked me.Now, to the film. The first act immerses us in the life of Arthur Fleck, a clown and wannabe stand-up comedian. At first, I was afraid that the manic laughter scenes would be too redundant and turn themselves to cheap gimmicks, to remind us that we're dealing with the Joker, but no, Phoenix plays his Arthur as a man who's not a bad person. Raised by an over-protective and sickly mother, brutalized by kids who sees in a clown a living sign saying ""kick me"", humiliated by people who can't understand his medical condition, the point isn't to portray Joker as a martyr but a product of a specific environment and education, or lack thereof. Like anyone, he's got dreams, projects, but he's entrapped in a condition that makes it impossible to communicate or connect with the others except through hallucinations and would-happen moments, he's a misfit with a fragile condition that keeps worsening until it offers a platform for his dark psyche to perform.Does the film excuse him? No. Does it justify his actions? Hell, no. It just clarifies the need to perform that way. There's a point of no return reached in that psychological journey, when one humiliation too many triggers a strong desire to express itself through a sort of showmanship, something relevant in our days where people seek any ways to reach posterity. Set in what seems to be the early 80s, it puts Arthur in the same urban alienation context than Travis Bickle but with a passion shared with Rupert Pumpkin's and a ""mad-as-hell"" prophetic rage with Howard Beale's role. Near the end, there's a shot that follows one of the film's most shocking moment and it's an obvious nod to the anticlimactic finale of Lumet's masterpiece.But I can't insist too much on how good Phoenix his, one could see a few impersonations of Malcolm McDowell's dance when he ""punished"" his fellow droogs or get vibes from the two only performances that earned a posthumous Oscar, Peter Finch and Heath Ledger, still, there's something unique in that tormented role he inhabits with such a soul dedication that it makes Nicholon's Joker worse than the cartoon counterpart. ,""Joker"" isn't dangerous but brave enough to question violence in the way it seems like the only plausible answer, it might titillate a few demagogue instincts but that's an unfair trial in the light of the recent events all over the world and that preceded the film. I walk often at night and see homeless people living in impoverished conditions, drowning their sorrows in alcohol and losing their manners once there's nothing to lose... and perhaps that's leaders' responsibility, praising democratic values while its application contradicts its own ideal. Anything is allowed when nothing is possible, is perhaps the biggest joke of all, and that it goes all downhill when the social budget is cut is perhaps the film's boldest stance against the shift between leaders and people.And that it used Bruce's father Thomas Wayne to connect the final act with a canon we're all familiar with is one of the many narrative delights of that character study and psychological thriller √† la ""Woman Under the Influence"" where suspense doesn't come from a bomb but a ticking bomb of a soul. If De Niro's presence ties the plot with its chief inspirations, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix who gave a performance for ages, and a character who's relevant in the way he pits democratic ideals against urban reality. And my wish is to see another connection with De Niro with Phoenix winning an Oscar, it would be the second time for a character who already won one after De Niro with ""The Godfather Part II"".As for the glorifying violence trial... we've been there already.","10/10"

"Joker","blanbrn","4 October 2019","Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!","8/10"
"Joker","Thecritichood234","23 December 2023","In my humble opinion, this is probably the top 10, book movie of all time in the top three DC movies of all time because This is what The DCEU needed. More character driven stories to be honest, more elsewhere or not a movie that's connected with the main universe type movie because this right here to me is a masterpiece. This is definitely a different interpretation of the Joker because if you look back, this was supposed to be Jared Leto's joker having a standalone film, but that did not work because first the carrier did not have any compelling things that he can do on his own plus DC was trying to catch up with the MCU Since the NCU was popular made a lot of money and people wouldn't stop talking about it but on this movie, this felt like a DC movie plus very inspired by Martin Scorseses King of comedy and taxi driver, but featuring the joker the reason that this my top 10 comic book movies of all time and possibly top three or top two DC movies of all time is because it's character driven and make a sympathize on the insanity and the crazy personality of the Joker because this is a good evil movie meaning that this is another protagonist movie which I like movie We are placed in a point of view of how Gotham is tearing apart itself, and how Gotham is tearing apart our own characters, and the core reason why this movie works for me because the stuff that he doing we should not be on his side throughout this whole movie he's killing he's murdering His own ""parent"" He's killing without remorse, but we don't turn on him. We still are on his side because the people around him are making him be this way. The people around him is making him have the right to kill them because Treat him badly and how It represents Gotham on a daily basis, and that right there is something DC needs to learn to understand their characters. And the performance by Phoenix isn't no heath ledger, but it's up there with the best performances in comic book history overall, this movie is what dc is all about, and the dark Knight, and the Batman, where is not trying to be like like other comic movies, or like the MCU, it is its own thing, more darker, more gritty, more deeper characters, and more deeper movies 10/10.","7/10"
"Joker","mickgmovies","5 October 2019","A lot has already been said about this film since it's release. It's a movie that will be hated by those who blindly overdose on the instant gratification and throw-away feel-good marvelesque movies, and loved by Dark Knighters who crave for brooding character development.It's not an easy film to watch. But it is captivating in a similarly slow-burn visually sumptuous way of past films it gives homage to: Taxi Driver, Kings of Comedy, Dog Day Afternoon and more. And similar to these movies, at it's heart is a central character whose slow slide down the ladder of society results in a series of pressure-valve-release gratuitous actions (towards the end).Whilst the movie misses a beat in using the stellar supporting cast to best effect, what it does do is act as a prequel to Batman that shows there's always two side's to every story. The Joker isn't born bad. And he doesn't knowingly derail young Bruce Waynes life. But ultimately he does find 'himself' in the events that unfold around his actions, and which snowballs through the media.It's here that a lot of the commentary on social extremism has been pointed, and with some justification. But what it really shows is that we all want to be treated as human beings. To be seen. To be heard. To be cared for. To be respected. To be loved. And to belong.Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker to find these things - that were missing in his life.It's here that it hits close to home, as so many of the events unfolding in our lives today are a result of similar sense of alienation and frustration with society letting people down. From a lack of compassion, care and respect for each other.","10/10"

"Joker","sneakyshooter","11 January 2020","Like this movie or not, you have to agree its at least a breath of fresh air. Phoenix does a great job at channeling just the right amount of psycho to portray the Joker.The cinematography and lighting is very well done and really sets the atmosphere. While I agree with some that the morales of the movie can be misconstrued, it seems to be about coming out of your shell to be your true self and not caring what others think.I did feel at times the movie was a bit preachy though. The whole ""we live in a society..."" comes off rather strong towards the end. Society and rich people = bad!! That was a bit too on the nose.I also never really got the notion that this Joker was clever or intelligent in this movie. He just seemed psychotic. Which is really only a small part of what makes the character scary.Now, I get that its from the Jokers point of view, but the Waynes and almost ALL other characters are just shown to be total one dimensional a-holes that we dont really have sympathy for. This could have been handled better I believe.BUT, what makes these bad things listed above so interesting, is the very real possibility that the events in the film were actually all in the Jokers mind. Its established early on that he has delusions often, so the entire revolution and his rise to hero status could have very well been all imagined, which makes a lot of sense.In conclusion though, I appreciated the risks the movie took and performance given by Phoenix. It was a fresh take on an already well established character, which can be difficult to do. And considering all of the god awful movies released now a days, I cant blame people who praise it as a perfect 10. Its deff worth it to give it a watch for yourself.","1/10"
"Joker","walfordior","23 October 2020","Joker was the absolute best film to end 2019, throughout the film, i genuinely thought i was watching a documentary; the acting was spot on, the small details in specific scenes, the costuming, and especially the music made one of the best films of the year.One of my favourite details is when Arthur meets Bruce, if you look closely; they're both wearing the same colours on their clothes, kind-of the same clothes too, but Bruce's clothes represent status, power and the upper-class, whereas Arthur's represent the lower-class. Such a small, yet beautiful detail to addFor the people who didn't like Joker because it made them 'too uncomfortable' it means that Todd Phillips has done his job right, this film is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable, sick, on the edge of your seat, etcin conclusion: This film is perfect in every aspect, the cinematography, the lighting, the small details like the trash bags alongside Arthur when he walks on the street, showing how disgusting Gotham is, and making that symbolic to how society treats Arthur; those small, yet beautiful details really make this film beautiful. A great way to end 2019, with this masterpiece.","10/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","OllieSuave-007","25 January 2021","This is the second Godzilla film in the MonsterVerse series, a story about the crypto-zoological agency Monarch finding themselves facing titan monsters Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah, and their ultimate solution is letting Godzilla battle them all to save mankind.The film is a little reminiscing to Toho Studio's classic 1964 movie, Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, but this time featuring the monsters in the 21st century, with some neat special effects. You get to see each of the monsters' unyielding powers and characteristics, and them battling each other is nothing short of edge-of-your-seat monster excitement. However, the CGI on the creatures were too dark at times, making the monster battles hard to see. It is also difficult to see the creatures' faces and reactions - just a whole lot of head-spinning movements and swift actions.The human drama was average at best, and the good guys vs. bad guys subplot was a major distraction from the film, I thought. Much of the evil doers' actions were overkill, and our protagonists were too preachy, save for Ziyi Zhang's duo doctor roles, which is a great nod to Mothra's tiny twin priestesses in the classic films. I also liked that the filmmakers incorporated Mothra's Song in this movie.But, as with much of today's films, there is forced comedy to lighten up the mood, courtesy of Bradley Whitford's St. Stanton character. His humor was extremely annoying and distracting, very out-of-place for the movie.With all the hard-to-see monster action to the distracting human drama, there is too much in the film to digest and makes it hard to appreciate the main point, which are clearly the monsters. It leaves little room to sympathize with the human characters and leaves you craving for more of the monsters.Grade D+","5/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Mickdrew99","5 June 2019","Crazy review title right? Well you might agree after watching this movie.You'll probably hear a lot of opinions from people who aren't homegrown Godzilla fans - and they will have their own thoughts on this.
I, on the other hand, am a big fan of the monster going years back. Finding a Godzilla movie in the TV guide, or a DVD for one of the Toho movies to rent was like winning the lottery when my brother and I were young.Here are my thoughts plainly stated: Yes, this is a better Godzilla film than the 2014 movie. There are *aspects* of the latter that some might say make it superior, but that would only make it a better movie in general - as a *Godzilla movie* this new one is quite a bit better.Don't listen to the people on RottenTomatoes talking about how ""the special effects are overly relied on and can't make up for the bad characters and plot.""
No. Those CG monsters are the best part, and they almost singlehandedly save this movie. The solution is not to focus less on special effects and develop the characters better. The solution is to have every human character stepped on in the second act and have the last 45 min center the story solely on the monsters - which I guess would mostly be fighting.The problem is this does not happen. Every moment you see the monsters battle, you enter a brief moment of bliss before you are ripped away to deal with people you don't care about doing things you hope they fail at. The first ""clash"" occurs in Antarctica, and that scene was actually quite good despite the focus on the humans. You're just now being exposed to these titans duking it out, so having people there witnessing the madness and trying to escape help play into how incredible this event truly is.By the 3rd act, however, this tolerance has dried up. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't a movie titled ""Godzilla"" imply that he is the main character? Because he doesn't feel like one. Without a doubt, THE biggest problem that Godzilla (2014) and this film have is they place waaayyyy too much value on human beings. Everyone in the audience is waiting for them to shut up and go away, but the movie has its head up its ass and thinks what they're doing is somehow important and worth focusing on. It would be like two warriors facing off, and having most of the climax focusing on ants running around on the ground trying to save each other.The only ""characters"" here that need development are the Kaijus. Have them be your stars. Have them be the focus. It doesn't just have to be mindless action like how snobby people will pretend that's all we want to see. Go ahead and tell a story, but NOT with people. They are not the reason we're watching this, and we don't care about them.One exception to what I said in the previous paragraph: Ken Watanabe
His big character moment was incredible. If you must have human beings involved, do them like this. He was amazing.","6/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","phd_travel","2 January 2020","Too much of the same thing. The story and characters were not well developed. Just climax after climax. Explosions and fights seemed repetitive. Vera Farmiga's character seemed too smart to be so dumb. And Zhang Ziyi didn't deliver her lines convincingly.Destruction of cities wasn't well done. Just seemed superficial and far away.Waste of lots of effects. Spending more money doesn't mean a better movie. Sometimes less is more. A simpler movie like the Korean monster movie The Host was so much more involving because you were invested in the characters and the creature wasn't too big.Don't bother.","3/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Hitchcoc","31 May 2019","With all the films and the mastery of special effects, we take for granted that movie monsters are going to be quite remarkable. I enjoyed watching them, especially Ghidrah. But then we have this lame plot with a nutcase deciding it would be good for the earth if most of the people were eliminated and we started over. The female/mother character has bought into this and is about to send the world to oblivion. The acting is so bad and the actions of the characters ridiculous. Standing around while nuclear radiation is a few feet away. Or a monster is right in front of them. Leaving a submarine and standing on the tower while Godzilla appears, instead of staying submerged. And the search fo the daughter at Fenway Park. I have to give credit. It was certainly loud but like watching a Star Trek episode, I challenge anyone to really understand the science. I wish it had been a better, more gripping story. Finally, like so many movies of its type, the loss of life is beyond belief and people don't seem all that concerned about their brothers and sisters.","7/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kbayless-1","5 June 2019","Ever since the perfection of CGI, Hollywood has come to the conclusion that if the special effects are good, then then movie is good. Thus, my 5 star rating. Half of the movie involved the monster battles and that gets 10 stars. The half of the movie where there is no monster presence gets 0. That averages out to a 5. Perhaps some day Hollywood will re-discover the lost art of screen writing and combine it with CGI to create a truly fantastic movie. But don't look for it to change soon. A lot of people came out of the theater visually dazzled by the special effects knowing that the story was awful but still thought it was a great movie. So they will continue make a lot of money creating these kind of movies and save on time & expense by not having to pay top dollar for a writer.","5/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ericrnolan","23 August 2019","It's true what they say about ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" (2019) - its script is almost completely brainless. It's got about as much depth as the old ""G.I. Joe"" cartoon (1983-1986) that played after school when we were kids.But I'd be lying to you if I said I didn't enjoy this. And I'm sure you know why - the big-budget, big-MONSTER special effects. They were spectacular - and sometimes they approached being unexpectedly beautiful. (It's hard to explain here, but our eyes are treated to more than skyscraper-tall brawls between ""titans."" We get a light show too - thanks to some confusing, thinly scripted, but nonetheless dazzling energy-based monster powers. It was really damned good.)Add to this a generally excellent cast, and you might be able to forgive the screenplay for insulting your intelligence. I know that most people would name Ken Watanabe as the actor who truly classes up the joint. And there's plenty of truth to that, but I myself would name Charles Dance as the movie's biggest standout. The man's craft is goddam Shakespearean, and I think he's equal of the likes of Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellen. And I'd like to think that his throwaway line, ""Long live the King,"" was at least partly a fan-service reference to what I'm guessing is his best known role - Tywin Lannister on HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" (2011-2019).Based on my own enjoyment, I'd rate this movie an 8 out of 10 - with the caveat that I'm a kid at heart when it comes to giant monsters. If you're the same way, then ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" might just become a guilty pleasure that you return to more than once.","8/10"

And how the director (Gareth Edwards) made the specific choice to keep cutting away from shots of Godzilla in favor of the human story involving Elizabeth Olsen & Aaron Taylor-Johnson? Well, I'm not pleased to say Michael Dougherty took that criticism and threw it out the window. Instead of 25-30 minutes of screentime like it was in 2014, Godzilla is in this film for about 35-45 minutes. He doesn't even enter the film until 40 minutes in, takes a nap in the middle act, and has a pretty cool final fight with Ghidorah. And that's basically your movie. I understand having a human side to these stories is essentially unavoidable, but then don't spend millions on great actors, cut down the runtime, and spend the remaining budget on more CGI monsters.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","shawthingproductions","30 May 2019","I loved the first Godzilla film. I loved Kong: Skull Island. As far as monsters beating monsters up, I enjoyed ""Rampage"" so - you know - I don't go into these films expecting a lot but this was an over long mess.The positives: the Titans looked good and.... That's it.The score was uninspiring, the acting was atrocious (and from actors you KNOW are capable of more than this), the plot was all over the place, the dialogue was laughable (I wonder how many times random people did say ""Long Live The King"") and there are issues with the logistics which bugged me too - although I should have let those go given it's a Godzilla film. The latter point being: How many nukes do they let off and surely that means anyone who comes within a few miles of Godzilla would die anyway whether he stamped on them or not. But yeah, we will leave that point there.Was it cool watching the monsters fight at least? Well no - it was dull. They looked great but the fights were more of the same the whole way through. You see the first fight, you're watching that again and again and again and again and again and... You get the picture). The film is over two hours. I had two naps. Each time I woke up, I wished I hadn't. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I was with my partner and I thought they were enjoying it. Only at the end when we talked about the film did they admit to wishing they'd left half way through.The plot itself was stupid. SPOILERS AHEAD.... Charles Dance's character was him literally phoning the performance in and whilst I understood he was an eco-terrorist, the other ""villain's"" reasoning for waking the titans up was just dumb, more so when it cost the lives of people they loved. Then, just to change their mind at the end with little provocation - it just didn't make sense and grated me more than I was already annoyed.I regret wasting my time with this film.","2/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","CountJonnie","10 April 2021","The movie starts interesting because it has the illlusion of a background story, with people setting monsters free, in order to save the world, only to regret it minutes later when the poo hits the fan.After that it becomes non stop action with one simple message: people are bad and/or useless. The people in this movie have 3 options:
1) Stand still, look surprised and do nothing.2) Shouting: ""We have to do something"", and do nothing.3) Run straight into danger, watch and do nothing.Each and every single actor feels useless, out of place, and every spoken line will make you cringe. At this point, the movie is all about Godzilla fighting other creatures, but that becomes boring and repetitive to a point that even the eye candy can't save this boring and superficial plot.","1/10"

That old ""who can save the world, but a child"" b.s. makes me nauseous.
But the most annoying part - the monsters keep arbitrarily changing sizes and proportions, depending on what the scene needs - if you need the protagonist to pet Godzilla on the snout, the creature is tiny, if you need him to take down a scyscraper, the monster is a motherf-n leviathan!

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","jazzyedwards","8 April 2021","Wow. Just wow. What a complete disaster of a....""film"" which it doesn't even deserve that title. Where to start? The movie starts off absolutely ridiculous. Very unrealistic scene that didn't make any sense. There are lot of scenes in the movie that literally just made no sense at all. The fight scenes were awful. They barely showed the monsters fighting and focused more on the human characters. In the middle of a fight scene I don't care what the humans are doing. The humans are literally right in the middle of the monster fight scene, right next to them and flames, shards, everything is flying around the human characters but yet none of them got injured or hurt all. Very unrealistic. The fight scenes were also very dark, and no this wasn't my tv. The scenes were literally dark, I had to turn the brightness up just to see what was going on. Horrible graphics. It was like I was watching a bad cartoon. Godzilla had no detail features. He literally looked like just a dark blob. The girl from ""stranger things"" is so bad in it. I never realized how bad of an actor she was. She was calling all the shots in the film which was just stupid. Her mother in the film was doing a ton of things that no mother would do and that made NO SENSE. The 2014 Godzilla film was pretty good overall and the fight scenes were great, but it was nothing to brag about. This film makes the 2014 film Oscar worthy. This is definitely one of the worst films I've seen in a very very long time. It was torture having to sit through it for 2 hours and 10 minutes. The. Only reason we kept watching it was because we want to see the new Godzilla vs. Kong which is a follow up to this 2019 Godzilla film and Kong: Skull Island (which was amazing by the way. Highly recommend Kong: Skull Island). If you can spare yourself from watching this movie just fast forward it until the end. Wish we would have done that.","1/10"

And it wasn't even a cleverly disguised propaganda. You know, there could've been at least a slight attempt to disguise it.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","peeedeee-94281","9 June 2019","The critics are right on this one, it's bad. The writing is bad, the acting sucks, it's so serious and throws in lame scenes of melodrama for characters we don't even care about. Looking for that Oscar moment lol. And how does a kid figure out a device that was only created recently, and only one other person knows how to use it?! The monster action, which should have been the best part, is barely visible. If it's not shakey came, its extreme close-up cam. And they hide all the fights with Ghidorah in a made up storm cloud that apparently follows Monster Zero around. Come on, they're not even trying hard to hide the fact it's bad CGI. And people are able to run through explosions, into areas where monsters are fighting, and not get even a scratch?! How does Vera Fermiga's character drive a Hummer into the middle of a stadium that has been destroyed by the monsters fighting?! And she drives out again after even more carnage. Stupid stupid. But the icing on the cake of this horrible mess: It's dimly lit. Yes, you heard me, every scene is dark. Nobody apparently has light bulbs when they are indoors. And when they are outdoors, and its sunny, it's as if you are looking at everything through dark sunglasses. Terrible. Mostly likely done because they messed up the effects, and had to conceal how bad it was.

It certainly won't disappoint in this respect, although movie critics will certainly pick up on the lack of real substance and a fairly lightweight, human relationship.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","theromanempire-1","8 June 2019","I am a die hard fan of toho sci-fi films. I own everything there is about kaiju universe and have watched every single toho Godzilla film numerous times in dvd and most of those films in a theater back at the time.The first 1998 American remake was an entertaining movie but never the less a failure for the real Godzilla toho fans.the 2014 version was a vast improvement as it was closer to the real feeling a Godzilla movie should have.
this new remake had even greater connection to the earlier Japanese Godzilla flicks.
finally we got to see a big budget film with king ghidorah ... rodan..mothra which is reason enough to go watch this film if u are a toho Godzilla fan like me.unfortunately the film had scenario issues they could find a better explanation as to why the monsters were released but at least they tried with that part to explain and there were also messages about the survival of our nation.
another negative was they did not shown a lot of the rest of the 14 like monsters they were set free.
besides the big four we saw only a glimpse of 2-3 other monsters. the mutos a kind of mammouth which I don't remember to feature in any of the Japanese Godzilla films and I think I saw kamakutra a well known kaiju from the film Godzilla vs the sea monster (1966)
where are the rest of the monsters ?
where are gorosaurus...manda....anguiras....varan....baragon.....mechagodzilla....spacegodzilla...destroyer....gigan....and so many others ?
they could have included a scene like that in destroy all monsters film in which we can see manda destroy paris...etc..etc
anyways those were the only two minors the movie had.
as for the rest the movie was great. the monsters looked great. the fights were long and fabulous.
For those who complaint about that.......it's a Godzilla movie. it's supposed to have long fights.
This movie is in essence a remake of destroy all monsters 1969 movie or also a remake to king ghidorah 1964 and it's sequel Godzilla vs monster zero 1965.
if u watch those 3 movies u will find that this movie was based on those 3 earlier toho films.
All in all it was great to see those past forgotten kaiju monsters fight in a big budget film with Godzilla and next year we get finally Godzilla vs king kong remake 58 long years after the release of the original.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","mhorg2018","2 June 2019","Ok, first the critics, who are paid mercenaries, are wrong. Very few times does any Kaiju fan care about the human characters. They exist for one reason: to move the story forward. The last time I cared about human characters in a Godzilla film was the 1954 version. And that's because those characters were important. In the following succession of films, until the 90's and especially in the 70's, the characters were either throw away or annoying kids. This film was a love letter to the fans. There were so many Easter eggs for the fans that it was ridiculous! I almost couldn't keep up with them.This movie gives the fans what they want: Godzilla fighting his most famous enemy: Ghidorah. It's a lot of fun and it's the kind of movie one goes to see and just loses oneself in. Tremendous fun!","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","cruise01","1 June 2019","Godzilla: King of the Monsters (5 out of 5 stars).Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a giant exploding blockbuster that delivers a movie that has epic action set pieces, visual effects, and a great cast ensemble. Story wise you cannot expect it to have a big story. It delivers with a story that can open up for more movies as it follows the concept of a monarch which they are researching and searching for titans and believed that the titans once rule the world.The plot opens up a little more about the world of titans and monarch. The story follows Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) who has created a device called the orca which can communicate with the titans. King Ghidorah is awakened which is like a three headed dragon that wakes up other titans around the world. It is up to Dr. Mark (Kyle Chandler) and the monarch group led by Dr. Ishiro (Ken Watanabe) to track Godzilla and aid him as Godzilla battles against King Ghidorah and Rodan. Mark is trying to save his daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as the world is falling into havoc.The plot does open up with the idea of using an orca device that can communicate with the titans. But if its put on the wrong hands, it can lead into bigger trouble. The first film took its time for the build up with Godzilla while showing brief parts of him at a time until the climatic battle. This sequel does not wait to show him fighting. The film builds up with the first 15 minutes with showing a family struggling emotionally about their past and loss. When King Ghidorah is awakened. The film lets loose with its epic visual effects battle when Godzilla shows up in the first half hour of the movie.Definitely, one of the best action packed films. It is big, loud, and has plenty of action set pieces to keep you on the edge of your seat. With Dr. Mark and the monarch flying from one location to another trying to evacuate cities with the beasts waking up. There is Mothra, which is a beautiful and colorful moth. Then, there is Rodan, which is a demonic bird-looking thing that lives in a volcano. And King Ghidorah is an unstoppable force of a three-headed beast. The visual effects are amazing. The action is spectacular.The cast ensemble is also good as well. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown were great. Charles Dance playing a villain type of character that believes the world is facing extinction cause of overpopulation and the pollution people are causing. And that the titans are the balance that can help reset the world's balance.The music score is also good as well that helped build up the suspense and thrills from music composer Bear McCreary. The film does set up for another movie which will be exciting to see. Plus there is a post credit scene which may hint towards a sequel.Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an epic awesome film that delivers spectacular action sequences with Godzilla battling with the monsters and the mass destruction. The visual effects, the cast ensemble, and the music score are great. Definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen possible.","5/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Leofwine_draca","23 November 2019","GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is a film much like its 2014 predecessor: average and interesting, but too flawed to have much in the way of rewatchability. I come to it as a huge fan of the Japanese kaiju genre; those rubber-suited bouts of the 1960s mark the high point of the genre to me, so this overlong epic is something I have a mixed reaction to. As before, the human storylines drag down the pacing and make this going on too much, and the staged conflict is boring at times.I like Millie Bobby Brown in STRANGER THINGS but she feels out of place here, tacked-on to appeal to that demographic. Kyle Chandler is also the most uninspiring protagonist I can imagine, although better actors like Ken Watanabe and Charles Dance are assured in smaller roles. There's copious monster action here as you'd expect, and I was delighted that not only does King Ghidorah show up but Mothra and Rodan too, with the right nods made to the original mythologies. But the CGI isn't quite as good as I was hoping for and the action becomes mildly repetitive before long.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","dee.reid","1 June 2019","Ever since the back-to-back successes of South Korea's ""The Host"" (2006), ""Cloverfield"" (2008), ""Pacific Rim"" (2013), ""Godzilla"" (2014) and ""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017), Hollywood has seen an increase in the popularity, and legitimacy, of giant monster movies - which began with ""King Kong"" (1933), but really didn't begin to take off until Japan's ""Gojira"" (1954) introduced to the world over the mighty ""King Of The Monsters"" Himself, the giant fire-breathing mutant dinosaur Godzilla.There's something to be said about Godzilla, who has not always had a warm reception with American audiences. For those of us who grew up watching the original Japanese Toho-backed ""kaiju-eiga"" (Japanese monster movie) features, Godzilla was the best and most famous of them all. We watched him fight other giant monsters (daikaiju) in increasingly silly plots and laughable special effects and horrible English-language dubbing; of course, this is because for many years, only badly edited versions of the original Japanese movies were all that was available stateside, and poor-quality bootlegs of the original uncut Japanese versions of the movies became highly sought-after collector's items. (However, DVD has made legitimate, high-quality prints of the original Japanese movies available domestically.)But to the Japanese and die-hards who took the films much more seriously than the average film-goer, Godzilla represented mankind's worst fears about the Atomic Age and nuclear warfare, being that Godzilla was the ""son of the atom bomb"" and was a living manifestation OF the power of the atomic bomb itself. Of course, this got lost over the years as Godzilla was transformed into a superhero over the course of the first-generation Showa-Era (1954-1975) series, later returning to his roots as a rampaging menace/anti-hero in the second- and third-generation Heisei-Era (1984-1995) and Millennium-Era (1999-2004) film series.In between those series, Hollywood took a stab at bringing the Big Green Guy stateside with the laughable ""Godzilla"" (1998); I saw ""Godzilla"" six times in the theater as an impressionable 12-year-old. ""Godzilla"" failed to make an impression with audiences and die-hard fans, but has nonetheless become something of a cult film in its own right, however marginalized it may be. But then Britisher Gareth Edwards gave the Big Green Guy a proper American update with his 2014 ""Godzilla,"" which I saw in the theater THREE times in just as many days as an impressionable 29-year-old, and with different friends each time. (The Japanese would also resurrect the King of the Monsters for themselves with 2016's ""Shin Gojira""/""Godzilla: Resurgence,"" which I also saw in the theater during a very limited one-week theatrical engagement here in the United States.)Of course, ""Godzilla"" was just the first in a potential franchise, and expanded cinematic universe - like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) - with joint backing by both Legendary Pictures and Japan's Toho. Those theories were confirmed over the next five years when it was revealed that in five years time, a second ""Godzilla"" feature would appear, and we finally got that with ""Krampus"" Michael Dougherty's largely superior 2019 sequel, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters.""Now this is the giant monster movie sequel we've been waiting to see in American theaters for the past five years. As a life-long Godzilla fan, I didn't go into the picture with any unrealistically high expectations, but I did come out of it fairly surprised at what I'd seen, and no, the movie is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but you get what you pay for, in my honest opinion. The film is steeped in reverence for the original Japanese film series - and hardcore Godzilla fans should have a ball pointing out some of the eagle-eyed/dog-eared references to said original Japanese film series (and even American ""B"" movies from the '50s, like ""The Giant Claw"" from 1957); did anybody catch those references to ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" (1975), or the Heisei-Era features ""Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah"" (1991), ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II"" (1993) and ""Godzilla vs. Destoroyah"" (1995), OR the Millennium-Era entry ""Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S."" (2003)?(See what I mean? Such references show that the filmmakers geared ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" to hardcore Godzilla fans at the cost of a more generalized audience - which, to me, is probably the film's greatest shortcoming.)However, beforehand, I did know a few details from Internet gossip over the intervening years. Essentially an Americanized, high-dollar remake of the Showa-Era classic ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"" (1964) - and throwing in a rather ham-fisted environmentalist subtext - ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" not only brings back Godzilla, but it also introduces to American audiences for the first time not one, not two, but THREE other classic monsters from the original Japanese ""Godzilla"" film series.Unlike ""Godzilla,"" this sequel wastes no time in introducing us to the monsters (now referred to here as ""titans""), who, following the events of ""Godzilla"" in 2014, are starting to become a common, everyday fact of life - in much the same way giant monsters were seen in the original Japanese film series. The King of the Monsters finds himself battling Mothra, Rodan and his first arch-nemesis from the original Japanese film series, the three-headed lightning-breathing dragon King Ghidorah (a.k.a., ""Monster Zero""). (Also in introducing these monsters for the first time to a Western audience, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" contains assorted references to Rodan's 1956 first appearance, Mothra's 1961 first appearance, and King Ghidorah's first appearance in 1964.)In between these epic-sized, city-destroying monster battles, Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his assistant Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) of the clandestine monster-detecting agency Monarch return from the first film, along with plenty of newcomers including Drs. Sam Coleman (Thomas Middleditch), Ilene Chen and her twin sister Ling Chen (both portrayed by Ziyi Zhang) and Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford), and also a fractured family - Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), who embarks on a globe-spanning odyssey chasing after his estranged ex-wife Emma (Vera Farmiga), after she and their teenage daughter Madison (""Stranger Things"" Millie Bobby Brown) are abducted by the English eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance). Jonah wants to use a device called the ""Orca"" that Emma constructed to locate and awaken other titans in order to take the world back from humans and return it to the monsters.(A large ensemble cast such as this harks back to the original Japanese film series, which shows that Legendary is starting to get a firmer understanding of how these films truly worked and why they appealed to so many fans after all these years. Additionally, the film's score - by Bear McCreary - contains many familiar themes originally composed by long-time ""Godzilla"" series orchestrator Akira Ifukube, who remained Japan's most esteemed music composer up until his death in 2006; the end credits also features a tongue-in-cheek cover of Blue Oyster Cult's tongue-in-cheek classic ""Godzilla"" by System of a Down front-man Serj Tankian.)""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" will most likely not disappoint its hardcore audience, but one could say that figuratively and literally, this is the biggest giant monster movie ever made. Michael Dougherty and co-screenwriter Zach Shields (working from their shared screen-story with Max Borenstein) had an enormous task in front of them, and for the most part they succeed - even if some monsters (Mothra) are short-changed for screen-time in the end and there's some unnecessarily awkward, and forced, humor moments that can detract from the seriousness of the proceedings.But this is a film this Godzilla fan truly enjoyed.Long Live The King.10/10P.S.: The film also contains heartfelt tributes to long-time Toho producer Yoshimitsu Banno and original Godzilla suit-mation performer Haruo Nakajima - both of whom sadly passed away in 2017.","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","SnoopyStyle","1 October 2019","It's five years after Godzilla's reappearance. Scientists couple Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) lost their son in the destruction of San Francisco.

When the base is attacked, Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are taken prisoners. Mark rejoins Monarch to rescue his family. The organization is threatened with folding under the US military. Instead of the possibly impossible task of annihilating the Titans, Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) could only suggest living under their domination.The premise is that the Earth is hollow. A Titan comes from space or not. Monarch has a giant super plane that can fly around the world forever. There are way too many people willing to Thanos the Earth. It goes on and on. It's a crazy mess of questionable ideas. The narrative doesn't really work. This should follow Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown. At least, they're interesting.

The action was decent for the most part, although i couldn't tell what was happening a lot of the time. The same goes for the rest of the movie, not just the action scenes. It was sloppy. Wasn't sure where everyone was or what they were doing. The human parts were pretty much garbage, but were played by good actors which made it easier to swallow.Story stupid. Characters non-existent. Decision-making questionable. But as with kong skull island, i should have been able to enjoy this as a mindless monster movie. I enjoyed some of it. But as an overall experience, i was mostly annoyed. And as the movie goes on, the cheese and cliches come out from hiding. Movie makers should have a cliche team, to catch any possible cliches. Doesn't make sense that they are still so prevalent (2 viewings, 3/30/2021)SPOILERSbiggest eye-rolling moment in the movie, they are driving fast. The guy in the back seat says ""if i had these two for parents, i'd run away from home, too."" driver slams on the breaks... ""what did you say?"" guy in the back seat repeats everything he just says. Driver and passenger (ex-spouses) turn to each other and yell ""HOME"" to signify that they knew where there daughter was going. S..... M....... H. Not only does the connection make zero sense, not only does it make zero sense to stop the car, but why if the effing eff do they need him to repeat what he said in order to finally figure it out. My second viewing was at home and i had to pause the movie from how much that one hurt me.This formula is becoming so obvious. The producers want a blockbuster that plays to a global market. So they have a premise (monsters fighting monsters), they add a wide variety of actors of different races (i'm a proponent of diverse hiring but this reeks of doing it for money, a token character of each race to draw in that demographic), and a simple but useless human story. Add some terribly written jokes, and sprinkle it with cliches like fake deaths, and of course, the obligatory self-sacrifice (this one had THREE OF THEM. Have you no shame???) it's like everyone is trying (and failing) to copy what the MCU has done so successfully. It's getting really annoying. Oh and the taking turns completing each other's sentences. Grrrrrrrr. NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT.","1/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","thesar-2","31 May 2019","I knew a time when Japan outdid us in technology. The King is Dead...Long Live the U.S.65 years, 35 Godzilla movies...and here's definitely the best or damn near the top. Now, that said, I'm only speaking of the movies I've seen of his. I've watched the 3 American versions, the new Mosterverse addition of Kong: Skull Island and about 7, maybe 8, of the remaining 25ish films.But, this isn't like James Bond. Right before 2012's Skyfall came out, again, I had only seen about 7 of the 25 Bond movies to that date (including the offspring no one seems to care about, Never Say Never Again.) So, I did a full Bondathon and watched all official/non-official 007 films. Here, in 'Zilla's case...I don't think I could stand THAT much cheese.So, going from what I know, the original 1954 Godzilla, 2014's Godzilla and this one, are the absolute three best I've seen. Only, King of the Monsters...probably shot its load a little too much.This was the Monsterverse's Avengers movie but times twenty. Probably overkill on the ideas and tie-ins to the previous movies, but I still really liked this movie a ton. I had an incredible amount of fun and satisfaction of how much screen time both Godzilla and other kaiju had.The gist of this sequel is: 5 years (in real time, as well) passed since Godzilla's ""first"" appearance and not a word from any titan...but, of course, Congress is bent on doing more damage to the Monster University, Monarch, than any giant creature. Simultaneously, humans from both sides of all issues fight for their say while the monsters rise for dominance. Now (us as the audience): Let them fight.The movie's hardly perfect and mostly gets weighed down from the bickering humans and a too-long subplot of getting one's daughter back. Not to mention everyone's motivations take waaay too long to realize and when explained, it's hard to know where to side, period.But, like in any Godzilla or kaiju movie, we're not here for the characters. I just always pray, they don't dominate 95% of the screen time away from Godzilla and pals like they did in that terrible Shin Godzilla flick. Here, it was probably 60/40% in favor of the humans. What we saw in that 40% was all I wanted as my little inner-boy was all starry-eyed in wonder. Finally the Godzilla movies I saw as a kid came to life on the big screen with the best CGI money can buy.Yes, this, the 2014 Godzilla and Kong's latest outing have incredible special effects and a huge plus in seeing all the previous movies made with the proper technology. And, now, going back to my Japan quip...Shin Godzilla, which came out post-2014 Godzilla, had some of the WORST effects I've seen since Sharknado. I am completely baffled that Japan, the originator of Godzilla, would take gigantic leaps backwards while the USA, an imitator, takes massive leaps forward. There wasn't a single scene in the Monarch trilogy that I didn't believe was happening as if it were made practically.Yes, some of the puny human scenes were distracting, but I didn't come for them. I came for a big bulk of giant fights and giants, in general. I was not let down. Before I even saw this, I had already planned my second viewing: taking my dad for Father's Dad. His and my idea combined. And I simply can't wait to see this again......or King vs. King when Kong shows up to battle Godzilla next year. THAT will be another edge of my seat experience.***Final thoughts: Talk about Easter Eggs!! They're practically begging me to actually do that 35-movie marathon with how much they crammed in here for homage to the franchise. The post-credit scene alone is jam-packed with many interesting things to see/read, but it all goes fast. I was already going to buy this on Blu when it comes out, but now it's a must just so I can pause it to absorb more of the movie's radiation...of goodies!","6/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","bobbywell","3 June 2019","Spoilers forthcoming....
I went to this movie to get away from family drama. Not have insane amounts.
First good things:
Godzilla and the monsters ROCK.
Glowing red meltdown Godzilla: WOW!!
Ken Watanabe... great.
Supporting cast: solid. I liked all of the non-main characters, even if they were never fleshed out.
The Russell family sucked. Why was this put in there? To make us want the monsters kill them?
First: mom brings daughter to a top secret monster research lab.
Two: mom ( supposedly a scientist) breaks quarantine to test a prototype.
Three: mom colludes with terrorists kills all her coworkers and 10s of thousands perhaps millions is people.
Daughter of course knows how to do everything and thwarts plot. Who wrote this crap???Conclusion: watch the movie. If you are in a theater go get snacks or use the restroom when the Russell family appears. If you are at home FF through them. You will enjoy it much better.","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","filipemanuelneto","2 March 2020","This film is the predictable sequel to ""Godzilla"", with the appearance of a legion of monstrous creatures called Titans. I liked, in general, the 2014 film, and I went to see this film with some interest, believing that finally Godzilla was having a more interesting treatment from the cinema. And I confess that I am not disappointed, as the film is even better than its predecessor in some important points.The film takes the point where the previous one ended and reveals to us the efforts made since then, to create a way of understanding and reproducing the vocalizations of the monsters already awake. It is with this technology that Emma Russell, allied with a group of mercenaries, tries to wake up the sleeping monsters that Monarch monitors. She thinks it will restore a natural balance in the world, perhaps through a massacre. I confess that I found this part of the script somewhat confusing. Against her is ex-husband Mark, who argues that all monsters should simply be killed or left to sleep. It doesn't matter; the fact is that they wake up the only one who should have been left to sleep: the Guidorah hydra, the only one that has the capacity to wake everyone up and control them to slaughter Humanity. It is now up to Godzilla and her fellow humans to contain this threat, even if it means the partial destruction of the world.As in the previous film, there are good and bad things in this story. It's a little hard to believe that creatures like that would spend thousands of years sleeping without being detected by curious humans. On the other hand, the film makes good use of material from classic legends involving monsters (Scylla, Kong, the Loch Ness Monster, Hydra and others). I was not convinced by the supposed alien origins of Hydra, I think it is a little credible detail of the script. There is also a time when everyone seems to stumble over Atlantic civilization, but that is never even mentioned.The cast's work is more enjoyable in this film than in its predecessor. For a start, I felt that there were more possibilities to connect with the characters. This bet made the film gain more interest as we feel more involved in the action and care more about what happens. Godzilla, in this respect, is a character in his own right. Among the human cast I would positively highlight Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga. Both do a good job, even though the character of Farmiga is very difficult to understand and unworthy of our sympathy. Watanabe continues to maintain the good performance that started in the previous film, ending it brilliantly. I don't know if all the merit belongs to the actor or if the screenwriter also reserved better material for the actor, but the truth is that it worked very well. Bradley Whitford, Aisha Hinds, Ziyi Zhang and Sally Hawkins do a good job of support. Millie Bobby Brown is almost left in the film and has little to do but be in danger when the script needs an extra reason for the characters to move faster.The film maintained the good production values of its predecessor. And there is no doubt that there is a lot of money invested. A grandiose and impressive CGI, with scenarios of pure destruction everywhere, the bet on a more luminous environment, which allows the public to better see the destruction of the world and the epic battles that are fought among the human ruins. Now we see better what the first film kept wrapped in dust and shadows. The monstrous creatures also seem to me better worked and realistic. We also have impressive sound and visual effects, good post-production work, with excellent mixing and editing, well-crafted special effects, good sets, costumes and props.Overall, it is a satisfying action and sci-fi film, with a somewhat elaborate story that works well if we don't think about it too much. You can pass the time, although it is not a work of cinema art. Godzilla will certainly continue to be a recurring monster in cinema, even though it does not give rise to really good films.","5/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","mjl1966","20 January 2022","A classic - even if appropriated - return to Godzilla as a cultural icon of Japan's national catharsis in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The first clue is a nod to the genesis of Godzilla in the naming of Monarch's primary base Castle Bravo - that fateful and disastrous nuclear weapons test from 1954. Godzilla was, indeed, born in the shadow of nuclear fire. As Dr. Serizawa says: ""Sometimes, the only way to heal our wounds is to make peace with the demons who created them."" That line right there is worth the wait.But it takes the movie a minute to get there. The first act is convoluted, confusing and disjointed with an over-accelerated pace of plot development that may leave you adrift at first. But once it gets on point, the story unfolds to reveal the classic Japanese tale of heroic sacrifice that is Godzilla.Brutal and poignant, I found the King of Monsters to be the most heartfelt of the modern big-budget Godzilla movies. Even if they mis-stepped on the front end and you have to side-step a few OTN references to the evils of mankind, the crew behind this movie pull it together once Godzilla shows up. It ends much stronger than it begins, and I think it's worth hanging in there to get the powerful payoff. Dr. Serizawa is your spiritual guide in this episode, with an almost fourth-wall breaking acknowledgement of skepticism and cynicism by several other members of the cast. The writers lampshade the incredulity of Godzilla's spiritual prowess a bit too much, but still give the spiritual story behind the monster everything they've got. Almost as if to say, ""We know some of you think this is trite. We don't care. We're going to do it anyway."" You have to approach this movie (like any Godzilla movie) with the spirit of attending a magic show. It only works if you let it. For my part, I found it quite moving.Long live the King.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","redcanofevil","3 June 2019","GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS (2019) :Lets start with a history lesson as it's crucial to understand what a Godzilla movie is. The Japanese created Gojira as a means of sneaking socio-political allegories in their movies and then the Americans took over, made the name Godzilla a household name and started doing larger than life monster movies. It was basically created as a B-movie where people wore latex suits to look like monsters and punch each other on set. So what does the new Godzilla do? It follows both its Japanese and American roots by creating a massive monster flick with deep seeded social allegories.I don't go to a Godzilla movie expecting an Oscar-bait and neither should the critics responsible for its low score. It was clearly made for fans who loved and stayed with Godzilla all their life and I dare say it's the best one yet.The two biggest downsides to this movie are ice thin plot and even thinner script. The plot is not necessarily bad but mainly serves as a breather for the next action sequence. The main intention of the ""bad guy"" is undoubtedly the worst motivation and reasoning I've seen in a movie. But once that is out of the way the plot progression is relatively passable. The story basically circulates around a device created by the scientist played by Vera Farmiga (I think she's called Emma, I didn't care and kinda forgot) and her dumb reasoning and approach to awaken the Titans and destroy a portion of humanity in order to ensure sustenance of the rest. And if that sounds familiar then congratulations you've seen Infinity War where it came off less sadistically and goofy than in here.As for the script, well there isn't one. I can bet the director walked in and said, ""Listen guys, it's a Godzilla movie and no one cares about the humans. So just say whatever pops in your head and we'll run with it"". And that is exactly what happened or if that isn't the case, they should fire whoever wrote it.As we all know, a bad script brings forth bad acting and there are a few. Well I wouldn't call it bad but it surely was lackluster. Ken Watanabe yet again wasted in a movie but I'll let it slide as he was responsible for a very awesome scene which I won't spoil. Thomas Middleditch was there doing usual Thomas Middleditch stuffs and Kyle Chandler seemed to be talking to a wall at one scene and his character felt like a ""know-it-all"" snob and was unbearable for the most part. Bradley Whitford mainly carried on with the jokes and Sally Hawkins did absolutely nothing. Vera Farmiga seemed like she was still in the Conjuring set and provided nothing out of the ordinary. The only decent performance came from the oldest and the youngest of the cast. Charles Dance was as threatening as he was as Tywin and did the best with what he was given. Millie Bobby Brown was given to be the damsel in distress and she actually did a fantastic job.Now that we've dropped off the cheap script, subpar acting and a plot as thin as it can be, let's take a look at why it is the best Godzilla movie ever made. The visuals were just jaw dropping and some of the shots in the film were absolutely sublime. The use of color to mark creatures was extraordinary and highly appreciable. The cinematography for the most part was solid aside from a few close-up shots but those were very few and far between. The monster designs were hands down the best I've seen and their scales were appropriately huge. Mothra looked absolutely beautiful and Ghidora retained its serpentine traits.The scale of this movie has to be mentioned as that is what drew me towards it. The sheer size and volume of each titan was a sight to behold as were the trails of destruction that followed. Words can't explain how much I loved the massive scales of everything.The fight sequences were truly fantastic and are a worthwhile. You can never go wrong with big monsters fighting each other in a half destroyed city and this movie cements that case. And this is the first Godzilla movie that offers more than a fair share of monster brawls and that too with gorgeous visuals with technical mastery. All my life I waited for a Godzilla movie that had each of the aforementioned elements and with Godzilla: King of Monsters I've finally found it.The movie contains its fair share of Titans although I was expecting some more fan favorite ones. Luckily a few of them were teased and although I wouldn't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet but let me just say two words: ""Oxygen Destroyer"". If you get the reference I'm sure you're just as excited for what's to come just like me.The movie pays proper homage to Japanese classics and even managed to play a variation of the core monster theme songs. The sound mixing was pure bliss as was the score in general. The classic Godzilla scream and the heavenly Mothra noise are all there as is their themes. They even teased the Mothra fairies in a way and I can't believe they actually made it work without coming off as super goofy.
In all fairness Godzilla: King of the monsters is a movie I've been waiting and wanting to see ever since I first saw the animated show and later got reacquainted with the Japanese classics. If you want to get the essence of a Godzilla movie, its lore and just basic monster on monster action in a grand scale with masterful visuals; this is the movie for you. This is a Godzilla movie done right and I have no problem saying I was satisfied for the most part. The rating might be off-putting to many but I loved what I saw and have been waiting for a movie like this for a very long time","10/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","nikola17","3 June 2019","This is Godzilla film i wanted to see this sequel proof's the first 2014 Godzilla film I have always liked Godzilla film franchise film saga of all time, when 2014 film reboot comeback the Godzilla 2014 the trailer made it look like intense and wanna see film but when you see it, it's boring as hell because you don't see Godzilla until like first 40 or 45 minutes of movie when the film goes for 2 hour long film something minutes he is less in it and human actors in first film are more in it like 97% of film how does people like first (2014) Godzilla when he is not much in it like 8% ? i don't get it at all ? this is full on going this shows Godzilla much more then first film does it's slow burn plus i wasn't much fan of first film but if your not fan of first Godzilla (2014) film then you will like this sequel a lot 10 times better then this film. look you may think it's 2 hour long boring movie of all time it's not. it's on going full on Godzilla kicking the crapout of another monsters and battling each another having all monsters kicking each another out that's how the fans wanted that's i wanted the first Godzilla to be like but no when the first scene where Muto shows up at airport and Godzilla they start fighting then scene cuts to kid watching on TV. in this sequel nope this sequel proof's everything wrong against the first 2014 Godzilla. the story the characters was a lot better but mostly entire movie it shows Godzilla, Rodan, Ghidorah mostly destroying rampaging everything in entire film. i loved special effects of this movie with blue and white effects, nice colors of it. love new upgrade from Godzilla is blowing out blue thunder out that's sick, nice color for film and poster as well it's beautiful. I actually like the human cast liked O'Shea Jackson Jr aka ice cube son he did a great job in this movie if he was lead it would be another version movie franchise of Pacific Rim Uprising, Independence resurgence. he would been great lead role but he was part of this movie. Kyle Chandler did fine he is a least better lead then to Aaron Taylor Johnson witch i didn't like him in this movie because he was boring as hell him as series actor with boring.story does follow up ending of 2014 Godzilla and it doesn't explain anything of characters from first film that's great i don't want to see them at all and i don't care for them. the start of film takes place from ending of film shows Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) was looking for his daughter Madison Russell
(Millie Bobby Brown) and his wife Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) after the disatar where the fight was over when Godzilla fighting Muto then story continues after 2014 film ended, it has villain (Charles Dance) witch he did good in film as villain, the main characters are more interesting then in first film the family Mark Russell i wish he could been played solider in first Godzilla film but he is a Emma's ex-husband, Madison's father, an animal behavior and communication specialist who formerly worked for Monarch, and co-inventor of ""the Orca"", a machine that enables communication with the Titans but can also ""potentially control them using their bioacoustics on a sonar level. After suffering a loss, Mark has an unfavorable opinion of the Titans, Godzilla in particular. Despite this, he joins a rescue mission along with Dr. Serizawa and Dr. Graham to save Emma and Madison from nefarious forces. his acting is pretty emotional he wants all creatures to die to be destroyed but people say Godzilla is not invasion of world he is their to save world, to kill the another creatures, the wife about her character is a ark's ex-wife, Madison's mother, a paleobiologist working for Monarch with a history of environmental activism, and co-inventor of the Orca. Unlike Mark, Emma believes that humans and Titans can co-exist peacefully. she is forced to do things that aren't her faultbecause she is forced to do a lot of things that are unexpected but she doesn't have choice by Charles Dance character A former British Army colonel and MI-6 agent who defected after becoming disillusioned by humanity during his time in the service but then he becomes a band of accomplice mercenaries. i thought those characters had a interesting thing in movie then in first film with characters that we cared for expect for Bryan Cranston character in first film. but i wished he was lead role for this movie of first film or this sequel but sadly it had to kill him off for no reason. They play a good supporting cast to the main cast you care about The Titans, but in my opinion i loved O Shea Jackson character in this movie the best when he plays a soldier in film.in film it shows entire more then human characters is they show monster verse that leaves you loud at theater and it shows more fighting and a epic cool looking showdown battling each another not just that it has great special effects, cool coloring looking, great CGI looks it was great and better and kicks the crap out of first film. Not totally sure why people are coming out of seeing the film with the 'it's not what I expected' attitude, they loved 2014 Godzilla
75% of rotten tomatoes ???? and it got that higher but this can't ? this got 39%
for no reason ? what was bad about this movie ? it didn't had much story ? it had too much great better CGI, it had full on kicking ass action and it shows Godzilla fully in this movie it shows Godzilla and monsters more then human characters, this is called a REAL GODZILLA movie when he is in it. not like in 2014 Godzilla where it shows Godzilla in 10 seconds and then scene cuts way to kid watching it on TV ? the film didn't saw Godzilla in 45 minutes until the end of film i wanted to see more of Godzilla and this is what i get i loved what i got. i don't know what people want from this movie what ? more characters then to less Godzilla ? that's freaking sad theirs no Godzilla in film, their are no presents in it. It's Godzilla, it's based on the King of monsters fighting to keep the title literally, but not literally, but he does more in this movie a lot more.
If your a Godzilla fan you will love this film more much more then the first film this shown Godzilla a lot more and he does a lot more then first film, give a sequel a try. Where Godzilla 2014 failed this movie and it stil got a succeed this is why you don't listen and pay attention to critics who knows what they want they wanna a Godzilla film they loved 2014 film when theirs no Godzilla and didn't do much in this movie and it doesn't show him until 45 minutes the movie is called Godzilla that's all it's called it should more Godzilla and more of him in it kicking ass nope it shows less Godzilla and more characters got great dumb success. believe me this is more of Godzilla kicking ass, this is more of his movie then to any of it and shows more of monsters more then first Godzilla.make sure Make sure you stay till the VERY end of the credits scene or for a final scene hinting at what ? could be to come. i have Walked out with a smile on my face after watching this movie then to 2014 Godzilla witch made say could of been better.","1/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Bertaut","14 June 2019","I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards's Godzilla (2014). Sure, there were plot holes through which you could drive an entire fleet of trains carrying nuclear weapons, it featured coincidences that stretched believability even by Hollywood's standards, the human characters were paper thin, and it took itself very, very seriously. But I enjoyed it. Ironically enough though, what I admired most is the same thing that a lot of people disliked - the fact that Edwards kept Godzilla's appearances so fleeting. Personally, I thought it was a masterclass in directorial restraint, and it had the effect that when the big final fight came, it hit home on so many levels because here, finally, we were getting to see the big guy throw down. However, I understand why some people were unimpressed that a film called Godzilla featured so little, well, Godzilla!The third film in Legendary Entertainment's ""MonsterVerse"" franchise, King of the Monsters is a direct sequel to Edwards's film (although sadly, he didn't return as director), and sets up Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), which is scheduled for release next summer. However, whereas Edwards held Godzilla back and made the action feel smaller by focalising it through the human characters, new director Michael Dougherty essentially inverts that formula, putting Godzilla front and centre and shooting the action in such a way as to make it seem as grandiose as possible. He isn't half the director that Edwards is, but King of the Monsters works well in a braindead summer action movie that's wall-to-wall giant monsters fighting one another kind of way. Sure, there are significant problems (all the best shots are in the trailer, the plot is beyond laughable, the characters are so thinly sketched as to make those in the first film feel Shakespearean, clich√©s abound, the talented cast is wasted), but all things considered, I enjoyed it, as it accomplished exactly what it set out to accomplish.Five years since Godzilla defeated the MUTOs, many more creatures (newly dubbed Titans) have been found throughout the world in various forms of hibernation. In charge of studying and protecting them is Monarch Sciences (introduced in a fledgeling state in Kong: Skull Island (2017), which took place in 1973). In China, Monarch paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) watch the awakening of the larval form of Mothra. However, when Mothra becomes distressed, Emma is able to calm it using the ORCA, a device which monitors the Titans' bioacoustics and transmits a dominant ""alpha signal"" capable of placating them. Soon thereafter, eco-terrorist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his private army storm the facility, stealing the ORCA, and kidnapping Emma and Madison. In response, Monarch track down Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), Emma's estranged husband, and co-designer of the ORCA, hoping he might be able to help find Jonah. Mark and Emma lost a son in San Francisco during the fight between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and whereas Emma came to feel the Titans could help humanity, Mark became convinced they should all be eradicated. Meanwhile, Jonah heads to the Monarch facility in Antarctica, and unleashes the only non-terrestrial Titan, a fearsome three-headed dragon codenamed ""Monster Zero"", but whom ancient humans knew as King Ghidorah. Arguing that humanity has brought the planet to the point of destruction, Jonah believes that if the Titans are awoken, the ensuing conflict would wipe out most of human civilisation, allowing the planet the time it needs to heal. And so, with Ghidorah awakening the various Titans throughout the world, Godzilla emerges to stand against him.Godzilla was originally created by Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishir√¥ Honda, and Eiji Tsuburaya in 1954 and was conceived as a metaphor for the destructive power of nuclear weaponry. King of the Monsters has one eye on its themes too (eco disaster, biodiversity, co-existence with other species, military impulsiveness, the insignificance of humanity compared to the vastness of nature), but really, the sermonising script by Dougherty and Zach Shields, from a story by Max Borenstein, is so badly put together, with the characters' motivations so poorly delineated, that any thematic concerns dissipate into nothing. Part of this is that the narrative simplifies Godzilla's 'morality'. In the 2014 version, Edwards muddied Godzilla's intentions brilliantly, depicting a monster that was fairly indifferent to humanity, and was far more concerned with the biological drive to reassert his alpha status. In King of the Monsters, both Godzilla and Mothra are fundamentally good, and wish to protect humanity from Ghidorah, which is more binary and not nearly as interesting a position to take.And yes, the film does address the fact that through inattention and greed, humanity is on the brink of ensuring its own extinction. The problem is that the script is so ham-fisted and poorly structured, the eco themes so preachy, and the organic integration of those themes into the action so lacking, that they come across as background irrelevancies at best, and distracting moralising at worst. And in any case, the film ultimately undermines all of this in favour of reaffirming the clich√©d old notion of human perseverance in the face of adversity.There are other problems with the script, however. For example, not one, not two, but three characters sacrifice themselves for the greater good (all at different times), resulting in none of the sacrifices really meaning anything. Another scene that doesn't work is the death of a major character; it happens so suddenly, amidst so much chaos, with the camera on even focused on them, that in the very next scene, the film has to show us their face on a monitor with the word ""Deceased"" written underneath. The character of Mark is also peculiarly written. Played by the top-billed Chandler, he has little to do for most of the film other than look at monitors with a concerned expression, coming off more as a fed-up dad than the protagonist of a Kaiju film. There are also far too many scenes of characters standing on the bridge of the Monarch flagship, the ARGO, spouting expositional word-dumps at one another. And not a single character in the film comes across as three-dimensional.There are also some hilarious spatial hijinks going on. I get that the ARGO is supposed to be a super-advanced high-tech mobile fortress, but it seems capable of flying from one side of the planet to the other in about ten minutes, and unless it's capable of transportation, there's some Game of Thrones-level compression of distances going on. Another problem is the twins played by Ziyi Zhang. Except I didn't even realise there were two of them until I read a few reviews. Sure, I noticed what I thought was a singular character appear to be in two places at once, but because the ARGO had already been globe-hopping all over the place by that point, I just put it down to the film's lack of geographic realism. The fact that it's so easy to miss that there are twins is spectacularly bad writing, especially considering they're supposed to be a modernised version of the Shobijin. And don't get too excited about seeing a Titan battle-royal. Apart from the central tag-teams of Godzilla and Mothra facing off against Ghidorah and Rodan, most of the rest (including those newly created for the film) are seen only in news reports and a montage that plays behind the closing credits, although a few do turn up for one scene.But for all that, however, I thoroughly enjoyed King of the Monsters. Although the trailer did promise what the film can't deliver on (Claude Debussy and pensive apocalypticism), aesthetically, there's a lot to admire. Erik Aadahl, Brandon Jones, and Tim Walston's sound design is suitably deafening, and Lawrence Sher's cinematography has a well-judged sense of scale, especially in the 2.39:1 3D IMAX format. This is complemented by Roger Barton, Bob Ducsay, and Richard Pearson's editing, which maintains the rhythm of even the most chaotic action scenes. The film also does some interesting things with colour. Whereas the palette is predominantly mixed when we're with the human characters, the Titans are coded in binary elemental colours: Mothra glows blue as a larva and gold in her final form, Rodan reflects the hardened red of the lava from which he emerges, Godzilla is the green of nature, Ghidorah is a neutralising dark brown. There are also some extraordinary individual shots (most of which have unfortunately been spoiled by the trailer); Mothra spreading her wings for the first time, Ghidorah perched atop an erupting volcano with a crucifix looming in the foreground, the reveal of Godzilla's lair. And the final shot is a goosebumps moment with which no Kaiju fan could possibly be dissatisfied. Purely at the level of craft, this is a hugely impressive film.Citizen Kane (1941) it most certainly isn't, but who expected (or wanted) it to be. The key to really parsing the film is to consider the context, looking at what it was trying to be. And in this sense, it's a success. Sure, the script is hideous, and Dougherty is no Edwards, struggling to accomplish what Edwards seemed to do with ease; bring his own personality to the spectacle. However, if you approach it for what it is, a dumb summer blockbuster about large monsters punching each other, you'll like it just fine.","4/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","0w0","28 August 2019","I don't mind a plot-hole or two, but when the characters in a movie are blatantly stupid or massively incompetent, THAT'S when I stop taking a movie seriously. I won't spoil the movie, but the characters in this movie have MULTIPLE chances throughout the movie to remedy a bad situation, and yet they simply don't do it... It's like when the 'good guy' is face-to-face with the 'bad guy' and then they simply refuse to shoot the 'bad guy' in the face, due to some existential crisis (or just due to a horribly written script)... well that happens multiple times in this movie. The CGI in certain scenes are also sub-par (though most scenes are fine)... they probably used multiple different CGI-studios on the movie, and that's why some CGI scenes look worse than others. Overall, it's a pretty pointless movie... why even make a sequel when it's going to be far inferior to the other movies in the franchise? Corporate greed, that's why...","2/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","doorsscorpywag","27 July 2019","People just stand watching monsters emerge only running away after a long drawn out pause for effect and a cool scene by which time it's too late..
Planes and choppers need to get within ten feet of monsters to fire missiles instead of doing it from 1000 yards or more. This results in more cool scenes where all the attacking planes get destroyed.Why all this is under the direction of the US makes no sense. We at one point are in Mexico but their army must be off building a wall as it is America 'saving' the townspeople.The 'plot' (and I use the term loosely) revolves around Millie Bobby Browns mother who with Charles Dance wants to save the world by destroying most of mankind because we are a plague on the planet. Of course they themselves are not volunteering to get killed and would form some kind of military/scientific elite once the monsters are finished killing a huge swathe of the population.Obviously it goes awry as events get out of control.
This monstrous woman who has the blood of tens of millions on her is given a chance to heroically redeem herself at the end instead of dying the horrible death she deserved.Millie Bobby Brown's character is somehow indestructible as at one stage she is hit by a huge slab of concrete which bounces off her head. She happily stands inside Fenway Park as all hell breaks out around here but miraculously survives it all.Acting is poor and the monsters not that great either. Most of the action happens after dark so they don't have to spend too much on CGI.Basically it is garbage. Not as bad as the 90s one, or the first one but still utter nonsense.If you want to see what Godzilla should be watch Shin Godzilla in its original Japanese language with subtitles. The dubbed version not as good.","6/10"

For one, the absence of Elizabeth Olsen and her husband is palpable. The movie is a good look at the core values of Godzilla movies- man versus nature. The acting and special effects are good. The story, itself, is the weakest aspect of this movie. Ken Wantanabe could say anything in any role and sound believable-he is good in this. Mille Bobby Brown and Vera Farmiga are good. The strength of the movie is Godzilla and Mother. They harken back to the origins of why people fell in love with these films.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","charliegeeza","3 June 2019","I have balanced my rating between what I, as a skeptical adult with high standards, and my son aged 7 would have given it. He gives it a 10/10 and absolutely adored it. I give it a 6/10 because, whilst the monsters were pretty spectacular and certain moments in the film fairly wonderous, it was a bit messy and had some aspects that I felt really let it down.As a father, I was disappointed with the inclusion of rude language. Hollywood seems to have long since decided that sh-- is not a bad word when it is not something most parents want in the ears of their kids. The when the f--- word was dropped I was pretty annoyed. It added absolutely nothing to the film, it was completely unnecessary and the film makers surely had to know this film would appeal to kids. It's a film about giant monsters! There was little to no blood in the film too.That aside, most of the humour fell completely flat. I don't know anybody who thought the Gonorrhea joke was funny so was baffled that they included it. Just cut that line out the scene and the film is better for it. I can only think that it was a pet idea of the director so was kept in the final cut.There were several tropes that just weren't required and served as annoyances. At one point they exit a plane with the first couple of soldiers being vapourized instantly. I guess it is intended to inject DDay-like battle anxiety in the viewer but it doesn't work at all - firstly there's not enough build up of the emotions the soldiers are experiencing as they arrive at the scene facing almost inevitable doom, in fact they completely gloss over the absolute fear everybody should be experiencing, and secondly because those vapourized soldiers are green screened into the shot we have no reactions at all from the protagonists.The monsters frankly moved too quickly at times, especially during fight scenes. It detracted from the sense of scale. It was a problem not present in the 2014 Godzilla where the movement was very well judged. There's also a moment in the film where something happens to one of the monsters that is passed off as 'not part of the natural order' but, again, the speed at which it transpires was just far too quick.There were also several bizarre time and space jumps. Often location changes seemed to involve traveling ridiculous distances in nonsensical times. There's a certain moment in the film when several monsters show up that would have required them to travel half way around the globe in just a few hours.What they really nailed right in this film, which they got badly wrong in the 2014 film, was the perspective changes during the monster battles. In the 2014 film it was almost entirely from the perspective of people on the ground, which meant you rarely understood what was going on in the fights between the monsters. In King of Monsters the perspective is shared between a proper action camera and the perspective of the protagonists on the ground.By far the most interesting point of the film was when they go in search of Godzilla, leading to the only really adventurous period of the film, culminating in a moment that should have been quite emotional as a character volunteers for a suicide mission, but I found myself not caring due to the failure to properly build the characters in the film, which was a shame.Why do I write all these criticisms? Probably because I felt this film could have been a classic. Instead it is a competent monster action film with a better story than the 2014 film but a sub par script and characters (no fault of the actors IMHO).","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","AdrenalinDragon","29 May 2019","After coming out of seeing Godzilla: King of the Monsters, I was very happy with the final outcome. Not sure what people were expecting outside of big Kaiju monster action sequences. The Godzilla movies have never been the highlight in terms of the story side of things. I didn't think the Human characters were as godawful as everyone was making them out to be. They had motivations and character arcs. Sure, some of them went into cliche and predictable paths, but I don't think it's weak enough to really hurt the film that much to me. Some characters from the previous 2014 Godzilla movie reappear in this movie, and I feel they do a better job here and are used more effectively. The pacing is also better in this movie and nothing feels too dragged out as far as I'm concerned.All I wanted most were big monster smash action sequences and this Godzilla
delivers that for about 2/3rds of the movie's running time. They are really
well shot and the CGI to me was fantastic, especially in IMAX 3D. The sound was booming and loud, and there's not really much I could fault on the technical side of this movie. It's a popcorn blockbuster action movie, and I think it's a pretty damn good one for what it is. No idea why the critics disliked this one so much compared to that snoozefest Godzilla 2014. My god that movie was so boring and Godzilla was only in it for like what 5 minutes? You get all the missing action everybody wanted here, and these iconic monsters battling such as King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan, and Godzilla himself. If you judge it for what it is, a huge modern Godzilla movie, it does a pretty good job at achieving that goal.8/10","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","FairlyAnonymous","3 June 2019","I want to thank all of the visual effects artists, animators, riggers, lighters, concept artists, story-artists and what not for being able to pull this off. Sure, the movie has some fairly big issues in terms of story, but never in my life did I imagine that I would see these iconic kaiju on the big-screen.""King Ghidorah in theatres? Nah, that would never happen."" I thought for many years.But here it is and every moment with the kaiju is brilliant. There was never a second where I didn't enjoy a kaiju fighting, growling, roaring, flying, or anything. A lot of care has been put into this movie's monsters to make sure they feel authentic to the original, but also ferociously updated.That being said, is it a flawless film?Far from it. There are some pacing issues (I think the movie is about 25 minutes too long), a lot of exposition, unfunny side-characters who constantly need to butt-in and make self-aware jokes and references that completely ruin certain moments, and a very poorly motivated villain.The villain actually irks me a bit not because their plan doesn't make sense, but because the movie makes them super evil but then later on tries to back-track on that element and make them seem like a nice person who we should care about. This villain is single-handedly responsible for killing about a billion people or more and yet the movie treats them like an average character who is just ""morally confused"". The movie even attempts to give them a ""heroic"" death, but there were many people in the theater shouting ""just let them die!"" ""Thank goodness they are finally dead!"" and other such things.All that being said, I still enjoyed the movie. It certainly understands what makes Godzilla movies entertaining and there was definitely a lot of passion put into this project. I just wish that one of these days we could get a Godzilla movie with both interesting characters and great fight sequences.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ZCDomingos","16 August 2019","I'm going to be honest, I love this movie, truly, but it's not flawless. On this chapter we got what we wanted, the true fight between alphas and the conquest of the true power over everything. And even though some people complaint about the human factor of this movie, I actually enjoyed it...until some degree.In these type of movies, either we get full monster fight or full human war with some glimpses of the monster. This movie is one of few that manages to balance these distinct perspectives.
Which side should we be on, that one that protects these monsters, the one that wants to kill them, the one that wants to weaponize them?! It's really interesting to me, and such an appeal and well balanced as we get to observe these monsters.That said, I can't say it's totally original. This human vs monsters has been done before, so it really needed to bring some fresh topics to distinguish from other movies, the plot revolving the mother was totally clich√©, the ""I want to save the planet, so I'll join the the villain side, but the villain turned out to be using me and fooled me the whole time"" has been done so many times and it didn't bring a new perspective or a fresh take on the plot, specially with her sacrifice in the end...clich√© from start to the end.Overall I was satisfied with this chapter, and can't wait to see what's to come","10/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","imdb-702-986813","30 May 2019","TLDR: What a mess! Lots of ""giggle with glee"" moments but also too long. Made me want to watch the 2014 one again.Full review:This movie had a surprising amount of heart. There was way more emotional intensity than I expected. And I think they actually did a pretty good job at creating a world with mythology and back story.But... I came here to see 200 million dollars worth of monsters fighting and destroying things!Alas, near the end, the constant stopping of the action to pour on more human drama got to be a little too much for me, and unfortunately I found myself feeling a little bored right when this movie's ""Godzilla surprise"" hit.It's almost like they went out to design some REALLY iconic images -- ones that'd make awesome posters -- then figured out how to wrap some fight scenes around them.It gets super-confusing when you consider the distances traveled and the amount of time taken, and the length of some scenes going from day to night to day again rapidly ... but, anyone looking for ""realistic"" or ""remotely plausible"" clearly shouldn't be going to a Godzilla movie.I don't have the slightest clue how Kong could possibly beat this guy, but we'll have to wait and see.Overall, I enjoyed the 2014 movie quite a bit more than this one -- the ""boring human parts"" did a much better job of staying out of the way and letting the real star shine.Still, I would recommend it.

I won't blame anyone for jumping at the chance to see this film, and it does deliver exactly what it advertises. That would normally set the right mindset for an experience like this. Unfortunately, the movie is both painfully straightforward while subverting expectations in a highly unsatisfying fashion. But instead of making another joke at The Last Jedi's expense, let's look at Godzilla: King of the MonstersGodzilla: King of the Monsters stars Raymond Burr as reporter Steve Martin, as he investigates sightings of a behemoth that has attacked ships off the coast of JapanWait, that's the wrong movieGodzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) is about ancient monsters awakening around the world, while the military and an organization known as Monarch try to handle the damage caused by these giant animals. As the enormous creatures start vying for supremacy against each other, humanity finds itself in the crossfire as the planet's largest battle for dominance is reignitedOr at least, this is what the story attempts, but ""attempts"" might be too generous. To say the movie crashes while flying its premise would imply it took off the ground at some point, but even three aerial monsters in the film didn't let it happen. The earliest sign of trouble with this story appears when the first of these titans rears its head and its features are barely noticeableThe decision to obscure these giant animals unfortunately extends to the territory battles between them. The fights are spaced far apart enough to not overwhelm the audience, but frequent enough to continue the thunderous footsteps. Unfortunately, on top of the behemoths being obscured by rain, snow, clouds, or smoke, the ""camera"" work involved with these CGI creations is close and chaotic to the point of being nearly indiscernible. There's rarely a steady point of reference to sell the size of these titans, and the ""color"" filter with their scenes only serves to hide them further even in plain sightWhat stands out the most about these monsters is the sound design, both the roaring movements and their musical motifs. The roars of the giant animals are excellently powerful, frantic, majestic, and threatening to match the titan. The vibrations of the tremors and trails from the wake of these behemoths emphasize their size and being where the visual framing does not. But by far the audio highlight in the best way possible are the creature's themes. Beautifully crafted masterpieces that invoke a sense of history from these ancient beings, while constructing a mythology and presence to reflect the nature of these leviathans. The extraordinary amount of care in this score is absolutely haunting, and by far the best part of the movieIt makes it all the more confusing that the film doesn't shut up. The fight scenes are spread out, but most of the space between them is intent on using loud tracks even when nothing cinematic is happening. Here would be a great time for the movie to let the audience catch its breath after its taken it away. It doesn't give time for the spectacle to settle, not for the frequency of the setpieces, but for the barely noticeable difference in ""volume"" between downtime and destruction time. The film wants to retain the viewer's excitement when the monsters are not on-screen (if they were even visible in the first place), but instead comes across as auditory hijacking. It overcompensates for itself and comes across as lacking confidence because of itThe most damning thing of all, however, are the human characters. If the monsters' presence is bombarded by inconsistent audiovisuals, then it's left in a heap by the infuriating human characters, and not because of military firepower either. Amidst the miscellaneous soldiers and scientists running about the story, are three thruline characters throughout the plot. One lacks purpose and personality in favor of being an audience surrogate. One is hyper-competent to a degree so as to nearly invalidate everyone else. One displays motivations that make less than no sense. And all of them are connected by tragedy via destruction from these behemothsThe dramatic thrust shared by these three characters is decimated by how poorly written they are. This is not okay. In 1954, there was a monster movie which had characters genuinely fearful both of the monster, and the consequences of what may happen should they take a certain step to destroy that monster. In 1989, there was a monster movie where a scientist was desperate to bring his deceased daughter back to life, only for it to backfire horribly. In 2004, there was a monster movie where the main hero's journey paralleled that of a monster fighting against an alien invasionThose films are Gojira, Godzilla vs Biollante, and Godzilla: Final Wars. They are different in tone from one another, but share in common a strong enough human element that contextualizes the sweeping spectacle of 50 meter, 80 meter, or 100 meter tall titans. Without that human anchor, action scenes featuring these giant animals can only carry a film so far before becoming boring. Not cheesy. Boring. This is even assuming the set pieces are compelling on their own in the first placeThis movie hurts. Even if the human characters were unremarkable, there's a baseline here that should have been highly entertaining for two hours. But not only are the human characters just milquetoast, they are aggressively aggravating. And the creature spectacle itself becomes tiring because of how haphazardly it's crafted. This film isn't painful because it could have been great, it hurts because there's a lot of care undermined by incompetence. It knows how to pace itself for breathers but doesn't let its downtime do what it needs to. It would have masterful sound design if it didn't insist on being loud all the time to the point certain music pieces can't shine through. The monsters themselves look great when they're not obstructed from view, while the roars and sounds from these giant animals project a lot of personalityThis film should have been an atomic blast but was instead a nuclear meltdown. After the studio behind this movie released two very solid monster films in 2014 and 2017, what should have been a three-peat didn't happen. The expectations on this movie weren't even the highest, because the monster films from 2014 and 2017 still had noticeable flaws themselves. Even carrying that tempered anticipation, this movie still hurts. I don't drink, but maybe Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) would be a better time if I wasn't sober","7/10"

This crap tells you everything while wasting millions on CG.There are so many scientists yet they seemingly do nothing science-like.Why is L, or whatever the hell her name is, from stranger things in this movie? She's obviously been type cast for screaming and crying- that's why. That's pretty much all the person does the entire film.","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","RNMorton","1 June 2019","I am a Godzilla-lover and also a movie purist. So there were moments watching this where I had some reservations. I'm going to pretty much skip that. The story was told via the new fad Transformer-style, that is, get a nice small set of characters, have all hell break loose without rhyme or reason, and just follow the characters. While I struggled with this more towards the beginning I got sucked in as we went along and enjoyed the good acting and also the very good special effects. The Big Guy was looking healthy and King G never more menacing. I thought the 15 year old playing the daughter was very good among several good performances. So forget the stupid frequently unexplained moments and just enjoy the ride. I gave a bonus style point for it not being too long, just the right length with no lull from beginning to end.","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Woodyanders","3 June 2019","Director/co-writer Michael Dougherty totally hits it out of the ballpark with this simply spectacular edition to the long running Godzilla series: Not only does Dougherty keep the engrossing and exciting story hurtling along at a breathless brisk pace despite the lengthy two hour-plus running time, but he also stages the thrilling and fantastic monster fights with rip-roaring gusto, maintains a refreshingly serious tone throughout, and keeps the human drama stuff on an even keel from start to finish. Moreover, Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and especially King Ghidorah all look amazingly lifelike and certainly deliver the rousing mondo destructo and go-for-the-throat thingo-to-thingo goods something fierce. The cast is quite solid as well: Kyle Chandler makes for an engaging human hero, Vera Farmiga likewise does well as a conflicted scientist who has given up on the human race, and Millie Bobbi Brown elicits sympathy as the daughter caught between these two, plus there are sturdy contributions from Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford (pretty amusing as the token wisecracking comic relief guy), Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance (spot-on ruthless as the eco-terrorist human villain), Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. Popping up in nifty bits are David Strathairn, Joe Morton, and CCH Pounder. Bear McCreary's spirited score hits the stirring spot. The special effects are truly incredible and Lawrence Sher's striking widescreen cinematography provides a wondrous wealth of breathtaking visuals. But this is really the Big G and company's show. And boy do they ever come through like the champion monsters that they all are.","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","AnonymousMouseMan","31 May 2019","I must say the action in this is wonderful, so much is going on, no hesitation. It starts off strong, but slowly we realize this movie is almost 100% propaganda movie straight from the media. The reason there is so much destruction is because humans deserve to all be eradicated like cancer because we ruined the environment and the titans restore the balance. But plot twist, the one titan they release isn't from Earth at all, he's a parasite of sorts.
All women are in charge of everything, army, navy, commanders, scientists, even to the titans like Mothra. Women make the big decisions with the exception of the end scene. Hollywood producers wrecked this by needing to put women first in a masculine role, it's unfortunate. I love Orange is the New Black, Handsmaid Tale, but women aren't going to run things like they do in this, it just doesn't fit it's so out of place and jarring you're like why is she in charge of this or that?Silly movie, all propaganda for climate change control and we should eliminate human beings and put women in charge.","10/10"

Zero justification of why would human tech work on these Titans when Titans most of the time can't hurt each other. All of a sudden human tech works for Godzilla but not for three headed dragon. Oh and thanks for destroying Godzilla's home btw. Lame repetitive dialogue over and over just like in GoT season 8! Had a hard time to sit through it all.","2/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","xecutionrecords","3 June 2019","Looking at some of the comments on here today it makes me think that the world really needs a bit of Titan Cleansing to rid us of some of the stupidity coming out of people's mouths. 'This Film was too loud'? (Err Monsters smashing things.. get it) 'Not Enough storyline with the humans'? (Err Monsters vs Monsters.. get it) next time if you are going in to a movie with uncertainty about what you are going to get may i suggest you watch the multiple trailers that dropped way before the film hits theatres & it's safe to say you might have chosen to go see Aladdin instead, cause Aladdin this ain't baby!
Godzilla KOTM is a love letter to Toho's classic monster franchise & is by far the best American version yet despite what some might say, Gareth Edwards 2014 movie had it's moments but was lacking those huge monster moments that it was crying out for, here Michael Dougherty (Obviously a super fan) knows exactly what you have come to see and delivers some truly breathtaking & beautiful shots, all filmed like a spectacular painting. There are nods everywhere to previous movies from the Mothra Twins, Music Cues, Movie Titles on banners, even certain battle moves are recreated all without men in suits so those who complain about cgi should check out now before you blow a fuse again! Their are moments of quiet, surprisingly quite a few jammed in amongst all the chaos, and although they serve only to get us from one battle to another, the underlying message of the movie is quite clear & well thought out, is it ridiculous? well yes of course, it's a movie with a giant moth & others of the like in so if you thought this was going to be grounded you are seriously deluded. But compared to previous Godzilla plots, it's a lot more coherent & serves the franchise well for future movies, it's a seed planter for sure. What i loved most about it outside of the beautiful monster designs & moments is it's huge amount of respect shown for past visions, Dougherty clears knows his Big G history and older fans will probably be bowled over by this as much as me, it's rare to see this in an American franchise movie but like the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Highlights are many, the Antartica Moment of King Ghidora's entrance was stunning and made me think & hope that Del Toro was watching and thinking about 'In The Mountains of Madness' again. Pretty much every scene with Mothra was just beautiful to look at (listen for the music cues here, fans of the big flappy one will love these moments) Her short battle with Rodan had some comedy in as well which again i loved, subtle & smart from the film makers always. My wife also pointed out the large amount of religious imagery in this film, their were crosses everywhere, usually somewhere around the big monster moments like when Ghidora is standing atop the mountain etc, again this goes well & fits fantastically in with the nature of the story being told. This is NOT just a big dumb monster movie, thought, care, attention have all been applied to it & if you are smart & know your Godzilla history you will be rewarded handsomely. Ultimately this is a movie for Adults who never grew up (yes like me) & children who just want to see something amazing unfold in front of their unschooled eyes. If you sadly are the type of adult who actually grew out of being able to smile, switch off, remember what it was like to be a child (delete where applicable) then this movie will probably not do anything for you, good news though, they make plenty of those movies for you so seek em out but do us all a favour & don't come on here & rant about it unless you have something objective or sensible to say (sorry, it was too loud just doesn't cut it) it's ok not to like something sure but just because it's not your type of movie doesn't mean it's not delivering what it's meant too. Reviewing a title should mean that, you talk about the movie objectively & judge it against movies of it's type, if you seriously though that the plot of this movie could ever be anything other than fantastical, your either a troll or just not paying attention whch means you should not be writing about it.
KOTM is not without flaws but those are so few in amongst all of the great that i have no doubts that this is a high bar for future film makers to rise above. Acting was good with what they had in their script, they did the best they could but seriously when your in a movie with 4+ Kaiju (& really good ones at that) you not going to be remembered that much in the foyer after.. sorry guys. A movie for fans of the Fantastic, the Mind Boggling & the Insane. A Movie for big kids & little ones to talk about for years after. A Gorgeous looking 2 hours of the ridiculous, thats everything i could have hoped for in a Godzilla movie. If you think that's being childish, good because i am in love with Movies like this. Long Live The King!!","7/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ubtgkse","13 July 2020","While the visuals are great, and ken Watanabe is the only good character, Godzilla king of the monsters is a major disappointment with human characters that constantly interrupt the fight scenes every 5 seconds that makes the film infuriating to watch and the humans are impossible to care for, wasted talent (Millie Bobby brown, Charles dance, etc.), a story that has a million holes in it, and the mothers plan makes no sense with her saying the world will be destroyed because of us so what do we do.... release 17 monsters to destroy the world???

Now we may not have cared too much about the classic Godzilla (Gojira) humans when it came to how they behaved or what their character was ... but we get spoiled I reckon. So when we see a story that is quite far stretched we might be nit-picking. Still this has less of the ""fake"" drama than the previous one, even though the stakes are quite higher ... now bring on King Kong into the mix (who only gets mentioned by name, but does not appear in this one) ...","6/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ninjaboyballer","3 June 2019","Godzilla King of the monsters is overall a great Kaiju rumble with some decent human characters. The Visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning. Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah, and the rest of the Kaiju are all beautiful, with the CGI being too notch in this film. The action and music are also a really nice touch to this film. The fights were awesome and the music put into the movie makes it feel exciting and tense. The one of the complaints I have with this movie though is that the humans could have been developed a little more. Like I understood the mothers plan but the way she was doing it was just mad. The father was underdeveloped and the daughter was just in situations she should have not survived in. And don't get me wrong I love Millie Bobby Brown and all the actors who gave decent performances in this movie. Although I really liked that one scene with Ken Wannabe, that scene was really great.Overall, Godzilla King of the Monsters is a stunning monsters movie complete with great action and musical scores, but the humans could have more developed and fleshed out. And all I have to say about those credits: #GodzillaVsKong2020Final rating: 8.2/10","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","xamtaro","2 June 2019","The sequel to 2014's GODZILLA and third installment to Legendary Studio's ""Monsterverse"", is a non stop, edge of the seat thrill ride in the vein of classic worldwide disaster movies like INDEPENDENCE DAY. Building on feedback from the previous installment, director Michael Dougherty delivers a spectacular love letter to the entire 65 year old (as of this year) franchise. It is exciting, it is beautiful, tragic, grand, an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish.We start off in real-time 2019. In the years following Godzilla's battle which leveled San Francisco, the world is divided over the knowledge that more of these so called titans exist and that the organization""MONARCH"" desires to protect them despite the destruction they may cause. Amidst this chaotic backdrop, a MONARCH facility in China is raided by an eco terrorist cell who kidnaps scientist Emma Russell along with her daughter Madison, so as to use her invention called the ""orca""; a machine that is able to record and mimic the titans bioacoustics signals which they use to communicate with each other. Led by the enigmatic renegade Alan Jonah, the eco terrorists plan to use the orca to awaken the hibernating titans in hope that they will restore the earth to its former glory. But there is more to this plot than meets the eye. Meanwhile, MONARCH engages the help of Doctor Mark Russell, Emma's estranged husband, and co-inventor of the orca, to try and locate the stolen device, his kidnapped ex-wife and child.If it starts to sound like a human focused ""angry dad rescuing family"" kind of movie, rest assured it is not. Our giant monsters, the titans, they are not just the backdrop, they feature front and centre from the get go. The prize target of the terrorists plot is to awaken ""Ghidorah"", a three headed dragon who had been the basis of legends like the hydra. They hope for Ghidorah to establish dominance over the other titans and control them. Unfortunately, Ghidorah himself has other plans. With seemingly alien abilities and power beyond measure, the only titan that might stand a chance against the multi headed monstrosity, is Godzilla.From the very first on screen appearance of Mothra, to Ghidorah, to the bird-like Rodan, and of course Godzilla, the whole movie goes full throttle with its plot. There is never a dull moment as we follow Mark and the MONARCH scientists led by Dr Serizawa across the globe trying to prevent an end-of-the-world scenario. You could say that it moves so fast that there is hardly any breathing room. Plot developments and characters development happen simultaneously and it's easily to get lost in the details if you do not pay attention.At our story's core is a tale of a broken individuals dealing with loss at the expense of a loved one. The Russells were victims of the San Francisco Godzilla battle. Their loss drove Mark to drink and become abusive leading to his divorce with Emma who in turn buried herself into her work, all while Madison suffered the fallout. In their journey towards making peace with the past, we see two hurt and bitter individuals choose to put aside their differences for the sake of their child and the world. It is a simple plot thread but with a heartwarming message about family.The cast play their roles perfectly; especially Kyle Chandler as Mark Russell and Serizawa played by veteran actor Ken Watanabe. The latter's role in the story becomes even more poignant if you watch the first movie and read both prequel comics ""Godzilla Awakening"" and ""Godzilla Aftershock"", knowing more about his history and a his connection to both Godzilla and nuclear weapons.However, the ones I found the most memorable were the G-Team led by badass lady Colonel Diane Foster. They are side characters with minimal development but the situations they are called to deal with, suppressing a terrorist attack, evacuating a city, luring an enraged Rodan away from a populated area, they do all that with guts and a strict dedication to their duty. The best part of it all? The human element is sufficient and never overstays it's welcome.Equal focus is given to the star attraction themselves: the giant monsters. All do them, Mothra, Rodan, Ghidorah and Godzilla all feature cool redesigns that pay homage to their original looks while taking it to a whole new level of badass. Moving Pictures Company (MPC) has outdone themselves once again in the CGI department. Special mention goes to the performance capture used for Ghidorah and Godzilla. Their expressions showcase clear human-like emotions and traits. Their body language blending the actor's performance with animalistic like movements. This motion capture is truly the descendant of traditional rubber suit monster performances.And when the titans clash, the visuals and cinematography effectively convey the immense scale of their battles. Thanks to Director Michael Dougherty and cinematographer Lawrence Sher, the movie is spectacularly shot with dark apocalyptic visuals, heightening the surreal spectacle of these massive clashes. We are truly witnessing war among gods!Pulse pounding music by composer Bear McCreary reproduces many of the iconic tunes from past Godzilla movies while giving his own unique spin, with drums and chants, imbuing an almost operatic feel to the movie. This is easily his greatest work to date.From the music to the characters to the monsters themselves, everything! The passion and love of the genre coming from the cast and crew is evident in every minute of this film. It is great for Newcomers to the Godzilla franchise thanks to the simple story, memorable characters, decent actors, and tight script. It's great as a gateway into the Godzilla franchise. For long time fans, there are numerous Easter eggs, references, callbacks, and parallels to past films. See if you can recognise them all. All in all GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS distills everything cool about Godzilla into a single modern movie.","7/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Aaron1375","26 June 2019","I enjoyed this film as it had incredible monster action and it was totally awesome watching Godzilla battle Gidorah on the big screen. That being said, the plot was not the best and with the exception of Ken Watanabe, the actors in this film really failed to make an impact. Still, I went to this film to see my first love as a young child, Godzilla, so I came away from this one satisfied for the most part. I would like to see this do better, but I can understand why people are staying away from it as some of the plot is just head scratching bad!The story, more Titans have been located and are being tracked as they are all in slumber for the most part. Prepare to hear Skull Island multiple times throughout this one as it wants us to know that Kong is the next Godzilla opponent. Well, a terrorist organization goes after the beasts in the hopes to destroy everyone because that is what will benefit the planet most. There is also a daughter and mother combination that I thought was a son and mother combo for a bit as the commercials she looked like a boy and their dad is an expert at nothing, but can fight and thank goodness the monsters fight because this story was not top notch.In this film, Godzilla's main opponent is Gidorah, which in itself is a head scratcher to me. We have a three headed dragon who spews lightening and comes from space and Godzilla's next opponent is a giant monkey...seems like a downgrade to me. Suffice to say, the next film I will be asking for a spoiler and that spoiler will be who wins, Kong or Godzilla. If it is Kong, not going. I had to put up with Kong inexplicably winning the first time, this time no, not getting my money if he wins which my guess he will because Hollywood will figure a monkey is more relatable or some crap!So, the monsters do a fine job or fighting and wrecking havoc. It was cool to see versions of Mothra, Rodan and Gidorah on the big screen and in a way that looks like they are destroying cities and not models of cities. Granted, I still like a number of Japanese Godzilla films more than this one. Next up for Godzilla, Kong and if Kong is the victor this film will not be next up for me!","3/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","JohnDeSando","30 May 2019","""Sometimes I think this is Godzilla's world. We just live in it."" Chief Warrant Officer Barnes (O'Shea Jackson Jr)It's summer blockbuster world, and Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a hot mess of good intentions bubbling over with smoke and fog that keeps geeks from fully appreciating the original Japanese destroyers. It's been 5 years since the old boy terrorized Tokyo and San Francisco.The first act looks like writer/director Michael Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields are aiming at an intelligent theme about cooperation but end in the third act losing all intelligence as in most superhero films with explosions and mano-a-mano monster mashing.The scientists, mainly married but estranged Mark and Emma Russell (Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga), are the chief protagonist-connections with the monsters. She is onto something about tapping into the titans' (the identifier of the original monster/ rulers of the earth) audio frequency with an Orca machine to neutralize them and eventually fold them into a benign universe of cooperation with humans.Along with the crypto-zoological, multinational organization, Monarch, the Russells work to save the titans from governments bent on destroying them. Not bad, but in these essentially cheesy films, Godzilla has to breathe fire, and Mothra and Rodan destroy anything, and ultimately the bad boy with three heads, King Ghidorah, has to bite his enemies to death.In order to humanize the proceedings, Dougherty includes the usual tension between teen daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), and mother Emma, with Dad Mark in between. Because the monsters are threatening life as we know it, this familial squabbling is all the more ludicrous for its emphasis.In our culture, we have always written about dragons and gorgons, so in a way we are right at home with these ridiculous monsters. That doesn't mean we have to accept the foolish plot points and silly dialogue:""We opened Pandora's box. And there's no closing it now."" Jonah Allen (Charles Dance)The ""box"" is summer blockbusters, monsters who return relentlessly every summer. Don't think about it too hard. Just veg out with the geeks.","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","stevendbeard","1 June 2019","I saw ""Godzilla:King of the Monsters"", starring Kyle Chandler-First Man, Zero Dark Thirty; Vera Farmiga-The Conjuring movies, The Departed; Charles Dance-Johnny English Strikes Again, Game of Thrones_tv and Millie Bobby Brown-in her first movie but you might have seen her in Stranger Things_tv or Once Upon a Time in Wonderland_tv.
This is the 3rd movie in the new MonsterVerse-it's kind of like the monster version of the Marvel Universe-with Godzilla_2014 being the first and Kong:Skull Island being the second and the 4th, Godzilla vs Kong, will be coming out in 2020. If you are a Godzilla fan, then you should enjoy this movie. Godzilla has more screen time than he did in the 2014 movie. Plus, you get more Titans-that's what the monsters are called here-including Mothra, Rodan and the 3 headed King Ghidorah. There are a few other new Titans, too. Kyle and Vera-both scientists-were married until one of the monster battles caused a death in their family and Kyle started drinking. Millie is their surviving child. Kyle and Vera had been working on a device to interact with the Titans-sending out sonic waves, it would either soothe the creatures or rile them up-before tragedy struck and after their separation, Vera kept working until she perfected the device on her own. Charles plays a mercenary that wants to get his hands on the device for his own reasons. There is an organization that studies these Titans-and even keeps some in captivity-called Monarch and they have branches scattered across the globe. During the end credits, they play the Blue Oyster Cult song 'Godzilla' but it is done by someone else-I saw their name during the credits but I have never heard of them. Speaking of credits, pay attention when they list the stars names, in particular, Godzilla, Mothra, etc. Make sure that you stay until after the end credits because their is an extra scene.
I really liked this entry in the Godzilla saga and would buy it on Blu-Ray.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Anurag-Shetty","2 June 2019","Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a direct sequel to Godzilla(2014). It is also the third entry in Warner Bros. & Legendary Pictures' Monster-verse, after Godzilla(2014) & Kong: Skull Island(2017). Monarch the agency that takes care of a wide spectrum of living creatures, do battle with a gang of monsters. These monsters include Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan & the three-headed Ghidorah.Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an awesome movie. Director Michael Dougherty has given us a movie that surpasses its 2014 predecessor & is on par with Kong: Skull Island(2017). The battles among all the various monsters aka Titans, are the highlights of the film. Towards the end though, these battles tend to get a tad bit repetitive. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. The cast makes this movie more relatable to the audience but, I wish they were given a bit more importance. Kyle Chandler is brilliant as Mark Russell. Vera Farmiga is spectacular as Dr. Emma Russell. Millie Bobby Brown is mind-blowing as Madison Russell. Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds & O'Shea Jackson Jr. are fantastic as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, Dr. Ilene Chen, Dr. Rick Stanton, Dr. Vivienne Graham, Jonah Alan, Sam Coleman, Colonel Diane Foster & Chief Warrant Officer Barnes, respectively.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ty-jensen","2 June 2019","I'm a casual moviegoer for Godzilla movies. I only seen the American Godzilla movies and I tried watching Godzilla Vs Mothra. I own Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island on DVD, they're not barebones.I enjoyed Godzilla: King of the Monsters, it's a fun monster movie. I honestly prefer the other MonsterVerse movies but I may reconsider. Godzilla himself has plenty of screentime, you don't have to wait long to see him. People were naturally disappointed his role was small in the reboot, I knew about it going in because of FaceBook.Apparently people complained about the reboot's lack of action because this movie is action packed, the first action scene begins around the ten minute mark. The action scenes are fun but the second one was filmed a little closely and the third one was bland. The visuals are gorgeous but we know that from the trailers. I think the reboot's visuals were fine.Like most blockbusters, the characters are boring. Kyle Chandler and Vera Fermiga plays scientists and a divorced couple. Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things plays their daughter, a brave girl interested in science. Aaron Taylor-Johnson doesn't return but Ken Watanbe does. The acting was fine, I think Millie gives the best performance.Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a fun monster movie, I'm not sure if it's good though. I just moved so I was a little stressed. If you love Godzilla, you will see it sooner or later. If you love action movies like myself, you should see it at least once. Godzilla Vs Kong comes out in March 2020, it should be fun.","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","rupert-ian","31 May 2019","Again we see just how ridiculously out of touch the film critics are, as audiences are enjoying this movie while they give it the equivalent of an ""F"" grade...let that sink in. An F??? Really?I've never been in a movie with so much cheering and positive audience reactions. People loved it.But why are critics hating it? Are they paid shills? Are they mad that their environmental extremism is painted in a negative light, as the villains in the movie adopt the ""world will end in 12 years"" fanaticism. They decide to awaken all the Titans so they can kill off billions of humans in order to send us back to the stone age and ""save the earth"". I think that might have ruffled some feathers.The effects are amazing. The monster action is amazing and has just the right amount. The acting is fine, the plot is fine.Anyone saying they are a long time fan of Godzilla but they hate this movie really makes me wonder...be honest, the plots and acting in the old movies was ridiculous but we watched them for the cool monster action and came to love the campy acting and plot as well. This isn't campy, it's just right for a modern telling of a classic Godzilla story with the four main monsters from the O.G. series. And they did the characters right, they didn't pull any RJ ""subverting expectations"". They listened to the criticism of the hardcore fans towards the 2014 movie and made the right adjustments. This will easily be my favorite Godzilla movie along side the original movie that started it all.The plot and acting in this movie is A+ compared to the old Godzilla movies, and I love them all.Let's hope the critics joining hands in trying to tank this movie doesn't work. If this had been made by Disney and was an exact remake of an old Godzilla movie, they would be calling it brilliant.Thankfully Godzilla vs Kong is already in post production, so even if their efforts succeed in making this a financial failure, we will still get that movie at least...Rodan was amazing. Mothra was awesome. I could have used more of both.Godzilla and Ghidorah were perfect.If you're a monster movie fan, you'll love this. Plain and simple. People like Stuckman claiming to be a Godzilla fan, yet giving this a poor review are liars. The out of touch critics can't objectively look at this movie and see that it does exactly what it sets out to do. What kind of scale are they using here? They praise Last Jedi while they tank this movie...one alienated a large portion of the long-time fan base, the other gave real fans exactly what they wanted. That deserves a good rating on its own.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","crazykingzx","30 May 2020","I keep seeing lots of reviews saying this film is really bad or medicore, and I have to disagree here. As a Godzilla fan myself I loved this movie and it was almost everything I hoped for a sequel to Godzilla (2014). Lots of things were better here like more monster screen time, more fights, music from the old movies, and lots of fanservice. The characters may not be great or memorable (which their a lot off), but there at least interesting enough for me to care. The monsters on the other hand are just so fun see like Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah. They all have lots of personality and cool abilities. They steal the show when there on screen and the soundtrack is fantastic. Akira Ifukube music is remixed a little or orchestrated and it sounds beautiful and epic. Its not a perfect film, but as Godzilla film, it is.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","sanjidparvez","1 June 2019","After watching this today, I must say, by far KONG: SKULL ISLAND is the best movie in the franchise; it was the most 'perfectly balanced' addition to the series in terms of entertainment level, setting human characters into the story, monster screen time as well as constructing their each stages of fight.
In the 2nd place, I'd put KOTM but it was mostly because of the awesome representation of the other big 3 of Kaiju realm...Rodan, Mothra & Ghidorah. Other than that, now it seems Gareth Edwards' 2014 GODZILLA at least did better than KOTM in terms of the Scale/size representation of the monsters, the momentum build up before their each appearance as well as treatments of the human characters(!). There's no short-lived, moving character like Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody this time; instead they introduced a kind of similar major character, Dr. Emma Russel (played by Vera Farmiga) but with questionable or at times laughable motivation & decision making level. Moreover, the way they put Millie Bobby Brown's 'Madison' into the midst of the epic finale also wasn't convincing at all, IMO. That being said, KOTM is still a great fan service for the Kaiju lovers. Monsters' brawls were quite epic from start to finish, specially Rodan & Mothra both were phenomenal and I wish they would have made a solo film for both of them in between of Skull Island & KOTM. Absolutely loved the way they introduced Ghidorah with distinctive personality for each of his head, he was totally the big badass of the story like the way he deserved to be in. Expected to see a little more diversified range of other monsters but overall Michael Dougherty & his team did a good job regarding the mythological aspects of the Titans.Aside from the cheesy writings here & there, GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is an absolute must see for fans of big G; a solid summer blockbuster. I'll give it another watch pretty soon.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Ed-from-HI","2 June 2019","I don't understand the mostly negative critical feedback (and less than stellar box office performance) for our longtime (i.e. Lifelong) massively Titanic thespian Hero Godzilla/Gojira.I really thought ""Godzilla King of the Monsters' would usher in/ solidify the multi-film/ multi-Year 'Dai-Kaiju' (Giant-monster) Cinematic Universe (akin to Marvel's or at least DC's). Fortunately, we do have at least one more Titanic Behemoth match-up to look forward to: next Year's Godzilla vs. Kong.But on to the review of ""Gojira: king of the Monsters"" =
I have to agree that the definite strength of this film is in the Dai-kaiju amazingly-artistic screen-representations and terrifyingly-beautiful characterizations, this film should rate a minimum 7/10 just for getting the 4 primary Toho Leads so massively & impressively (and in the case of king Ghidorah frighteningly) right-on-the-mark! Seriously, the CGI effects here (and artistically rendered Creature-concepts) exhibit a genuine amount of artistry and hyper-imagination but also deliver in terms of providing the audience with literal & visceral 'Earth-shaking' impacts that seem to go far beyond any giant-monster Epics of the past (the only downside being that the two main Godzilla vs. Ghidorah monster smack-downs are shot within environs of snow-storm and rain-storm respectively - I do wish one of the main Events was featured in the clear light of day).Mothra (especially larva-form was also amazingly well-done, exhibiting a real 'personality' with emotions at times (Mothra in fully-winged form should have been featured a bit more at the end, she definitely gives Godzilla a great energy 'power-up' assist - but the transfiguration happens so fast, that I don't think the general audience received the full emotional impact of Mothra's ultimate 'sacrifice' - you needed to be somewhat familiar with Toho Heisei period Mothra (and fire-Rodan from the same period) to fully-understand the shorthand synergy (of combined Godzilla + Mothra-spirit-energy) at the finale.I would say that director Michael Daugherty over-produced and over-delivered on the Godzilla vs Ghidorah massively-awesome + genuinely visceral Visuals (probably in response to the fact that Gareth Edwards original 2014 Godzilla although very well-made, came-up a bit short on action) - however, it is true that Daugherty might have sacrificed some story elements and a bit of clear linear narrative in order to ensure the near wall-to-wall action that definitely satisfies lifelong Godzilla/Gojira fans but might have left general fans a bit mystified by the narrative-shorthand that seemed tailor made to suit the Toho (both Showa & Heisei) Godzilla die-hards (like me) - but either way, Godzilla merited at least 7/10 even for a general audience Score - and probably a 9 to 10 for Toho die-hards!Finally, I actually thought the acting performances were good to outstanding; outstanding were Ken Watanabe as 'Serizawa' the one human that seems to truly understand Godzilla's importance/ gravitas (and even exhibits a bit of 'spiritual' link with the greatest Dai-kaiju).... Charles Dance as the intensely focused and quite menacing Eco-terrorist head was brilliant as usual.... Millie Bobby Brown gives an earnest, believable and emotionally-resonant performance as Madison Russell..... and Vera Farmiga is solid (as usual) as Emma Russell (although she should have been given more time to explain why she released Ghidorah without more forethought as to innocent lives that would be unnecessarily lost ..... that seemed to be the major non-sequitur of the film's narrative since Emma seemed otherwise quite humane and level-headed).In Summary, I think Mike Doughety's ""Godzilla King of the Monsters"" most definitely delivers for Godzilla fans in almost every way....... And makes Lifelong fans glad that Big G will be back for at least one more action-packed outing with Kong next summer.... And hopefully many more cinematic adventures after that!There is still a lot here for general audiences in terms of positively beautiful (and artistic) visuals and believably lifelike renditions of the 4 main Toho charismatic Behemoth anti-Heroes .... the narrative could have been a bit tighter but the acting performances are actually much better than critics would lead you to believe..... bottom-line: very enjoyable popcorn flick for general audiences (but for Lifelong Gojira fans, much much more!)","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Figgy66-915-598470","30 May 2019","30 May 2019
First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Godzilla: King of the Monsters. very much in the genre of Clash of the Titans, we find ourselves watching clash of the monsters. This is very much a film for those who love extreme epic battles fought by the gargantuan. The CGI is something else. Used in most films these days it still has the power to awe. What come from the minds of the writers, directors and producers is brought to life by these keyboard computer magicians. Not the greatest of plots but who needs it when it's visually stimulating. One thing I did love was the use of the Osprey throughout the film, although some of the landing and take off scenes were pretty unbelievable. If you're a monster fan, or more to the point if you are a Godzilla fan you will love this film.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","rgkarim","1 June 2019","The start of summer is the start of big movies and this weekend opens up with the ""king"" of blockbusters in the form of big monsters. Over many years, the giant monster movies have intrigued many and disgusted others, but they exist nonetheless to unleash their own brand of big budget chaos to the world. Yet with mixed results, can this genre find the right audiences or are we still plagued by the modern era of too much bang and not enough buck?

SUMMARY:Big budget films about monsters require a lot of things to appeal to the mass audiences and much of it has to with special effects and action. The King Of The Monsters manages to focus much on this, becoming a special effects extravaganza that did not yield to the limitations of speakers and screens. The animation is on point, and many of the creatures look stellar in their design, throwing away the prosthetics and papier Mache for stellar high definition CGI graphics. Smooth monster animation that looks to stick to anatomical movements are beautifully unleashed and it helps bring these monsters one step closer to being real. Eventually the monsters start battling and the action scenes have a number of special effects in both sound effects and visual styles to unleash Armageddon on the big screen. Those who love seeing chaos unleashed with little else binding them, and getting a little more human involvement as well, should be pleased with the destruction at hand in that fastest way possible. This is especially true in the final battle, where the behemoths battlegrounds hold much to be destroyed, assisted by theater shaking sound editing, an epic symphony score to add edge, flashy blasts from the atomic driven beasts, and plenty artificially generated beasts to fill your eyes. It's climactic and satisfying, and something I was hoping to see since the trailers showed.
With special effects focus though, the movie sort of stumbles on other categories that still need some work for this reviewer. The opening of the film is rather boring, a jumbled mess of convoluted introductions, explanations about what is going on and the human focus that will lead to all the mess. For a movie about monsters, much of the screen time still focuses on the terrors of humanity, focusing on how much we suck in our attempts to control everything. Unlike Kong, Godzilla's second arc still has trouble grounding its size to a deeper plot, that involves interacting with these creatures more than from the safeties of the bunkers. Even if you don't care about the story, the action scenes are also in need of some work, even the climactic ending. For one thing, many of the fights are very short lived, over in mere minutes after buildups of more talking from humans. The Fight with Rodan might have been my favorite, having the most integration of human and beast combination that brought me into the zone, but other times it was a jumbled mess of quick shots of stuff blowing up before panning back to humans. Other times, there were shaky bouts of camera work of close up monsters and falling buildings. This improved at the end, but it took a long time to discover something other films have already mastered. Finally, the number of monsters represented was not awful, but again trying to put too many in for them doing very little is a component that annoys me. Mothra and Rodon were kind of there, hitting there moments at the right times, but not maximized. Other creatures we get to see passing shots of, but they were unnecessary when we could have had more epic monster battles.
As you can see, the King Of Monsters is certainly going to hold the special effect event of the summer, or at least pretty close to it. It's problem is, that it's imbalance issues continue to mix the movie up in a messy sorts that some will love and others won't. The monster aspect gets points for chaos, destruction, and special effects that these movies thrive on so monster fans should be stoked by these aspects. The action again is mixed for me, part awesome with the special effects and yet part disappointing because of the fast pace, focus on humans more than monsters, and shaky camera work that could have been expanded upon. Perhaps the next installment can figure out the chemistry to the monster movie balance and bring back the magic of the dying genre. Still with all the special effects and monsters in this film, despite how imbalanced they are, the movie is worth the visit to the theater. So check it out when you can.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5","7/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","martimusross","1 June 2019","Godzilla- King Of The MonstersIf you liked the Meg you will love this......just fantastic.I saw this movie at Cineworld O2 in the 3D 4DX and I was both literally and metaphorically blown away. I cannot recommend highly enough the 4 DX cinema for the all action mega blockbusters, wind, rain, smoke, lightening, smells and the rollercoaster seat. If you don't like a rough ride stay away as it's not for the faint hearted, I heard several people scream in fear, it was great.....lolThis movie within its genre was nearly perfect, we had large plastic monsters, heroic mucho behaviour, an incomprehensible plot, action, the chase, mysticism, treachery, and lots of gadgets and boys toys. It all came together into a fabulous movie, it's not for everyone, it won't win an Oscar, so what Philistines it was a fabulous night out.","7/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","justin-fencsak","2 June 2019","I first saw Godzilla when it was on TV in the late 80s on local TV and grew up with the Hanna Barbera cartoons on TNT when they aired it during the Godzilla 1998 craze and bought the original badly dubbed Godzilla 1956 on vhs before seeing the uncut Japanese version on Amazon Prime years later. In 2014 i rented the first ever Godzilla movie meant to be part of a different universe, the Monsterverse, which consists of Godzilla, Kong Skull Island, which i liked, and this one, followed by Godzilla vs Kong. I saw this movie in 3d and enjoyed it very much. It actually moves at a good pace and a post credits scene shows what happens to one of the monsters after the big battle is over. Millie Bobbie Brown is great and so is Vera Farminga and the monsters are the stars of the show. The music is also great and pays homage to the original classic and there is a great cover version of Blue Oyster Cult's hit song Godzilla in the end credits. Long Live The King!!!!","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","HairyMart1","30 May 2019","So what's to say about this film since the title and trailer make it abundantly clear what it is. Giant monster fights Vs other Giant monsters, and not surprisingly, people, cities and everything else gets squished in the process. As before there are some people running around to let you know where the action is and what the name is of the current onscreen beasty. They are all fine with the little they have to work with - mostly an awe inspired stare. Still nice to see that Millie Bobby Brown can do good work with limited opportunity. As for everything it's all pretty good, though I do wish they had managed to incorporate the Clair de Lune music into the film, that was used to such great effect in the trailer. Effects are all first class, maybe a bit more variety in the design of the ""bad"" monsters would have helped, and on a personal note much preferred Gareth Edwards fleet glimpse of the creatures, rather than the full on in your face option here. Still it does what's its supposed to on the monster fight side, and there are some wonderfully composed shots with these behemoths framed against a firey background.","1/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","subxerogravity","1 June 2019","Overall, this was nicely done. It's a very old school styled monster flick. Thought I was watching a Godzilla movie made in Japan back in the 70s. It's a big movie that can be clumpy and clunky at times. It tries to hard to make this movie connect to the monsterverse they want to make. Too much info is packed in with too much CGI action and it shows a lot, but Godzilla is truly some star power and he does not let down when he gets on the screen. Not as much monster mashing as I thought but his battles with the three headed alpha were impressive. I liked the human cast. They did good with the overload of story they were given. Plus I saw it in imax and I'm not complaining, it was worth it.","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","elliotjeory","31 May 2019","I have seen mixed reviews for this film and had low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised to see it was actually a good film.
It's a huge improvement on the first one which I thought was just average. There's a lot more action and different monsters which was very entertaining. It has a good story, wasn't too much like some films are.
As well as the big action set pieces it has a very good lead cast and supporting cast. It's over 2 hours long but didn't feel like it, there were no times where the story dragged, it was just right.
It's refreshing to see a blockbuster film that's not superheroes all the time. Godzilla is the new superhero and if watching giant movies on the big screen is your thing then I highly recommend this film.","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","masonsaul","1 June 2019","Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a great sequel and huge improvement over the 2014 Godzilla. Godzilla has much more screen time and truly epic fight scenes with the other monsters. The CG is incredible and never dips in quality. It's extremely well paced, moving from one amazing set piece to the next and has fantastic music by Bear McCreary. It's well filmed and has some visually stunning moments throughout and Michael Dougherty's direction is great. Ken Watanabe, Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown all give great performances but there are too many human characters resulting in a few actors getting sidelined. Luckily the focus stays on the monsters and it's title character.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","stevenrotherforth","16 October 2019","Godzilla: King Of The MonstersOkay so let's not go on too much about the plot of this movie because for what there is of one it's a bit of a stretch.
Not the monsters! Anyone going to see this are already onboard with the premise of Skyscraper sized beasties battling each other.
It's the reasoning how we get to the showdowns that takes a lot of swallowing.
Even Godzilla himself would struggle to digest the lunacy of this films story. But if like me you just want to see big ass monsters beat the snot out of each other then you are in for a treat.Expanding on the already established Monsterverse this latest instalment sees the titular Kaiju take on a whole host of unearthed mega beasts.
That's as far as I'll go in terms of the actual movie.
What you wanna know is if this is any good?
Well the answer is for those who couldn't wait to buy a ticket or purchase this film on Blu-ray, it's a resounding yes!
Absolutely! A 2hr 12 min fun fest of pure action and carnage.
If you are one who craves a good script and fine character development,
then you will be massively disappointed.
Acting is adequate in delivering poor dialogue. Characters are purely there to provide exposition and to fill in the gaps between CGI creatures kicking the crap out of each other.
This is not Oscar worthy material.
However what is Oscar worthy are the special effects and sound design.On 4K Blu-ray this film is of reference quality.
Presented in Dolby Vision this is one stunning looking movie.
Specular highlights are often blinding as this is a predominantly dark movie.
Scenes with car headlamps, explosions and Godzilla's atomic breath are very vibrant.
Dark scenes have immense shadow detail due to the advanced HDR that Dolby Vision offers.
This is a noticeable upgrade in terms of overall clarity compared to the 1080p Blu-ray.
It's not a 4K crisp image due to a layer of grain added in post production but this does give the movie a more cinematic look.It can't be denied that this movie is of epic scale.
The battle of the beasts is further elevated by a demo worthy Dolby Atmos sound mix.
This is the best 4K Blu-ray I have heard so far in 2019.
Bass is certainly the dish of the day and it's served up in Kaiju sized portions.
Every moment of this film offers some sort of aural perfection.
For those of you who have a dedicated Home Cinema system then prepare to have the plaster removed from your ceilings.
Right from the opening credits this movie rumbles with violent impactful sound. Prepare to strap your Subwoofer down as it will probably move around the room.
If the LFE is rocking then surround sound effects are equally impressive.
Fighter jets pass from speaker to speaker. Missles wizz pass the ear.
This is surround sound heaven.
The Atmos technology is utilised perfectly with Godzillas roar heard from above. This is a treat indeed for the Home theatre enthusiast.The movie may lack in some areas such as having a logical plot and characters with any substance.
I don't want to go into spoilers. Just watch and see.
However as a 'Take your brain out and have fun' piece of entertainment,
'Godzilla King Of The Monsters' is an absolute atomic blast.","9/10"

The suspense, the thrill, the twist and turns of this film was so underappreciated. Great cast, great director, great all of the above. This is only the beginning, wait for the next film, it should be even better. I just watched this movie three times back to back and would like to watch it once more, but I have no more free time.

If you ever liked a Godzilla movie you really, REALLY, need to see this movie. I cannot wait for the next one, they need to be working on it right now! It was pretty much spelled out at the end what the next movie will probably be about. Speaking of the end (SPOILER ALERT), you know what other monsters will have it coming in the future movie. Anyone of them that didn't come and bow down basically has a movie coming starring them catching a beat down. I also love how they really tied the King Kong movie into this movie. If you like monster movies this movie will leave you smiling at the end. Also, stay for the after credits scene. I knew this damn movie was going to be fantastic, I might have to go see it again. This is the very definition of a summertime blockbuster!","7/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","robfollower","31 May 2019","First impressions of KOTM . Great for the ""Creature Feature"" spectacle !!Co-written and directed by Michael Dougherty, who has also helmed the spook-fests Trick 'r Treat and Krampus, Godzilla: King of the Monsters stars Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown.There's no such thing as too much Godzilla!Apart from Gojira and Shin Gojira, none of the movies that make up the source material are particularly 'deep' . It needs big, pretty-looking action. It needs a handful of things to look at (for the awe of the Kaiju/Titans is half the fun) this film does it in spades! I got just what I payed for !! An epic Kaiju Battle Royale . Godzilla King of the Monsters was fabulous especially for fans of the original Toho Kaiju genre.It delivers far more satisfying thrills and terrific spectacle when it comes to what fans expect from these kinds of films. Indulges in all the kaiju fights ! 8/10
Godzilla aka Monster Zero.How many of the original Godzilla suits have been preserved?Yes, some of the original Godzilla and kaiju suits do still exist. The majority of the suits used in the Toho Studios productions of the Godzilla series were made of latex, rubber, and foam rubber, and were designed to be used in multiple films. However, due to the nature of these materials and the wear and tear from filming, many of the suits have been either repurposed, destroyed, or worn out over time. There are a few original suits that have been preserved and are on display at museums and special exhibitions, such as the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City and the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo.The oldest Godzilla suit Toho still has is the 1994 suit used in the Heisi era film Godzilla vs Space Godzilla. All other suits before that have either rotted or been destroyed to the point where they are not recognizable anymore. These are rubber suits and they do rot over time no matter preserved they are kept. They mostly have suits from the millennium era.Now if they had the original 1954 suit above that would be priceless and be kept in a glass container with tight security. But its been 65 years since the original film and the suit does not exist anymore. So Toho decided to make a replica suit from the 1954 film and they did a great job.The oldest suit that still exists is the one from 1994's Godzilla vs Space Godzilla. I have never seen this film I need to add it to my list !","7/10"

The most unbelievable part of this film is not all the giant monsters, it's how dumb or irrational the humans are.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kjproulx","2 June 2019","I'll be straight right off the bat and state that I haven't seen the endless slew of Godzilla movies that were made in Japan. I've seen the original Gojira film from 1954, the awful American remake in 1998, and the 2014 version, which kicked off this new run of films that Warner Bros. hopes to make into a giant franchise, crossing over with King Kong. With all of that out of the way, I was going into this sequel hoping for some monster action that far exceeded its predecessor. It may be the fact that only briefly knew the names of these others monsters throughout the film, but having not seen the classic franchise, seeing them for the first time here was quite the spectacle. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is by no means perfect, but I believe it's worth seeing for the visuals alone.Loosely following Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as they plan to slowly release each new found monster one by one, they're caught in a bind when things begin to go astray and every one of them is released at once. With the falling out of their family in the past, Madison must decide if her father or mother is truly the one on the right side of things. Aside from that, this movie is all about the spectacle of giant monsters fighting, with a clear set-up that will eventually lead to the film Godzilla vs. Kong next year. If you can invest yourself in the numerous overblown action sequences, then this is the movie for you.The human characters are throwaways, even though I would like to put an asterisk next to Millie Bobby Brown's name. Although she is given some of the worst dialogue in the movie (and there is a lot of that to go around at times), she is a fantastic young actress that will only continue to strengthen her ability to steal the show as time goes on. The humans throughout the course of Godzilla: King of the Monsters really do feel like plot devices or stereotypical scientists just so that these monsters have a logical reason for being released to fight. For that reason, I found no possible way to fall in love with this movie at all.That being said, the promotional material for this movie has been promising a lot of action and a lot of action is what is presented here. There are some massive throwdowns and the CGI is quite impressive as well. On top of the action, this is a very well-shot film by cinematographer Lawrence Sher. Yes, the visual effects definitely add to his shot composition, but there are some beautiful images sprinkled throughout this film, making a few moments during the battle scenes feel like a piece of art.In the end, Godzilla: King of the Monsters put the human characters in the back seat in terms of development, which works out in terms of presenting numerous action scene, but ultimately feels slightly hollow at times because of that. From the very nice score that gave me chills at times, to the visual effects actually impressing me quite a bit, I was able to forgive many of the flaws here. That's not something I usually say, so I'm giving quite a bit of praise to the overall look of the film and the spectacle that goes along with it. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a good movie with many issues, but I really would recommend it to action/monster movie fans.","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kluseba","31 May 2019","Three years ago, Shin Godzilla was the most mature entry in the franchise that surprised with a surprisingly realistic plot, lots of political drama and intriguing characters. But that was a Japanese movie while Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an American film that rather follows the gloomy Godzilla released five years earlier that was overall convincing despite a few lengths. This movie here rather compares to the shallow Kong: Skull Island and offers a brainless but entertaining spectacle.To be honest, this new film is rated so positively because the special effects are astonishing, the pace is breathtaking and the monsters look amazing. Godzilla gets defeated on two occasions but always manages to come back stronger than before. The return of King Ghidorah is spectacular and the monster convinces as giant antagonist. Rodan is also featured in a few scenes but far from being the most spectacular monster. Mothra's appearance is somewhat disappointing as the legendary character only appears for a few scenes and fails to impress.The story however is insultingly ridiculous. It features many plot holes and the characters are constantly making stupid decisions. One can't expect performances worthy of Academy Awards of course but the characters in this film are particularly irrational, shallow and unlikable. Especially the Russell family is quite annoying. The mother is willing to sacrifice humanity because she can't cope with the loss of her son. Her daughter follows her blindly, constantly risking her own life and those of others around her. The father is arrogant, grumpy and headstrong as he ignores orders and thinks he is cleverer than anyone else. One couldn't care less about such antipathic characters.In the end, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the kind of film that invites to switch your brain off and enjoy a colourful, effect-ridden and fast-paced spectacle. This film is great for what it is but might only be memorable for young audiences and those who aren't familiar with the legendary franchise. Some of the old Japanese movies were also quite silly but the original Godzilla: King of the Monsters which was released sixty-five years ago is still more thought-provoking, realistic and dramatic than this high-budget Hollywood flick. Hollywood should leave this Japanese franchise alone and Western cinemas should have the courage to show films like Shin Godzilla in the future.","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","WasiReviews","17 September 2020","It had a lot of monsters fighting (which I came for), unfortunately they ruined it by adding the family dynamic same boring and drab. Miley and her family could be written out and the whole movie would be better, the search for the monsters makes no sense considering their size. These creatures are so quiet you can't hear a 100 ft object moving in the ocean? How useless are your ocean microphones? The CGI was top class hopefully they got a better script writer for Godzilla vs Kong.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","jaybizman","9 November 2020","I've probably seen all the Godzilla movies, from Toho's guy in
a rubber suit from the late fifties, until the latest -
""King of the Monsters."" And IMO, this one rates a sold nine.After a bit of a slow start it get's going and The Big Guy is now - HUGE.
(In preparation for next years Godzilla v Kong.)Standout (apart from the well done Titans) is 15 yr old 'Millie Bobby Brown',
who is already a Hollywood Star (last seen in Enola Holmes), who was paid
One Million Dollars for this outing and THREE Million for the next Godzilla.
Pretty impressive for a teenager, who acting coaches say is a natural.So after Kong: Skull Island, and Godzilla: King of the Monsters; everything
is set up for the big rumble in 2021 between the two Titans. I can't wait.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","yettygutschow","1 July 2019","It's giant monsters running amok, why do people seem to want some intellectual masterpiece??? The special effects were superb and the story followed a consistent plot line. There were no glaring plot holes...maybe a few things that you'd shake your head at. However, this is science fiction and it should be possible to overlook a few things. It's just a movie about giant monsters, after all. I suppose there are people out there that didn't like the fact that the environmentalists were the crazy ones in the movie...so they gave it a poor rating???","10/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","curse-of-egypt","13 January 2020","Ok. I've watched this movie God only knows how many times including seeing it in the movie theater and I never get sick of it. I've been watching these movies, all of them since I was 6. I will be 60 in May and I will never grow out of these movies till the day I die. I will say one thing about the part where they discover Godzilla in a ancient sunken city with the help of Mothra. One guy thinks its ancient Egyptian but when I saw it and from all the stories I have read about one sunken city, only 1 place came to mind and I know I'm right about it. The sunken city is supposed to be Atlantis.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","skjoe-1","29 May 2019","As a child growing up watching and falling in love with the Godzilla franchise, this film delivered everything I wanted. It's a rewarding experience for fans of these monsters and they are done justice and not just visually or in the action scenes. Firstly you will be glad to know this does contain a hell of a lot more Titan scenes than 2014's Godzilla. They aren't totally dominating the screen but without the human characters the plot wouldn't be able to progress. This is also the case in most of the old Godzilla movies, occasionally involving politics or issues like the environment and man vs nature.
My only issue with this film is not a technical one within the film itself but I think the more of a Godzilla fan you are, the higher your enjoyment will be through this movie. If you don't know any of the monsters or some of their history it might not bring a huge smile to their face when you first see Mothra or they may not get pumped up when Godzilla and Ghidorah finally meet.
The films plot revolves around using a sonar device to send out signals to awaken certain titans, all in the hopes of restoring balance to the world. It isn't exactly the selling point of the movie it serves as more of a way to move our characters towards the next goal, a titan or the next conflict.
Although the human characters aren't (and never really were) the sole focus of these types of films, I find myself not disliking them. I actually kinda routed for them, Millie Bobby Brown is wonderful and charming, Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler were fine, this family that has fallen apart and lost a child due to the events of the first film. I was hoping for them to reconcile throughout and make it, which helped the tension throughout some intense action scenes. The rest of the supporting cast weren't really memorable but I didn't mind.
As a mega fan I was super excited everytime a new monster would emerge, or a conflict was about to erupt I was filled with child like wonder and sheer joy at watching these icons from the monster movie universe being presented. It wasn't just the fantastic design, making each one feel unique or the way they moved and sounded when they roared. It was that each one had a personality and wasn't pushed to the side or felt like they didn't matter in the final fight. They aren't the only monsters in this film but these 4 serve as the main stars of the show. I loved the build up to each battle, the cinematography and the epic pure colossal scale of each beast squaring each other off before charging into each other firing off atomic blasts and lightning just gets my blood pumping everytime.
To sum up, Godzilla King of the Monsters is a solid monster battle on a grand scale, that will satisfy you on the visuals and sound alone. If your a big fan of this franchise, it's a true delight, the ultimate clash of the titans done justice with a big budget and with a director who is actually a fan of the characters. A must see!
P.S. You will fall in love with Mothra!","10/10"

All in all I'd say there are 10 minutes of monster action. The rest is talking and looking at a black box. The Roland Emmerich movie was the best one. He made Godzilla a threat and a real god.This movie is a waste of time.
Give this movie franchise 10 years time and give it to someone who wants to make a movie about monsters, gods, titans, whatever. And it doesn't have to be 132 minutes long if you have nothing to show!

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kane_1371-117-231060","29 May 2019","This is just pure madness.
Remember when Pacific Rim came out and we imagined what would a godzilla movie done in the same manner look like?
Well we got it, kind of.
I have been so underwhelmed by the recent movies and certain series that I have not written a review in a while but this right here deserves one.
Godzilla: KOTM is a visually stunning, impactful and thrilling Hollywood remaster of the Showa and heisei era monster movies.
I believe that if it was not for the adoration Pacific rim got from the fans we would not get this movie as we all know Hollywood likes to play it extremely safe.
Godzilla: KOTM delivers on that power fantasy that pacific rim brought to our attention ten folds but falls short on the balance that Rim had between the crazy kaiju battles and the outside world.
It probably was not even the directorial team's focus either and that is fine, movies are not supposed to be following the same recipe all the time anyway.
The Godzilla of the Legendary was not the only American redesign that was done right, this time we get to see more and every single monster is looking great.
My favorite is of course Ghidorah as I always imagined him with much bigger and menacing wings than what Japanese movies showed and here we got that.
The sound effect in this movie is bombastic and complements the action shown on the screen and the music is far better than the reclined back seat annoyance that Godzilla 2014 was.
The best part was the use of original Godzilla and Mothra themes which I felt was a big miss that it was missing from the 2014 movie (Godzilla theme of course).
Among the horrible Disney movies of recent release I am glad that a few movies came out that I could actually enjoy.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Troy_Campbell","31 May 2019","Checklist: skyscraper-sized atomic-lizard creature. Tick. Electricity-breathing three-headed dragon. Tick. Gargantuan luminescent moth and behemoth aircraft-eating pterodactyl. Tick and tick. All of the above battling for supremacy in our modern cities. Tick. If this all sounds as riveting as your list of chores for the weekend, then you can quickly and safely assume this movie isn't for you. If, on the other hand, that catalogue of mayhem-causing monsters gets you excited then this sequel could be right up your alley. Doubling down on the gigantic-scale action of 2014's Godzilla (and, well, every Godzilla movie), this follow-up ditches the slow-burn build up and cranks out set-piece after set-piece at a rapid rate, seemingly introducing a new element into each sequence. It occasionally suffers from Transformers style action - choppy camerawork, rampant editing and fuzzy CGI - but it thankfully minimises this in favour of monumental wide shots that artfully display the titans or in extreme close-ups that accentuate the enormous size disparity with humans. The sound design is once again on point too, the thunderous roars and penetrating shrieks reverberating through your body whilst Zilla's radiation-charging power-ups instantly gets the adrenaline pumping. Although kicking big goals in the action/spectacle department, the dramatic narrative filler is a major hurdle, particularly when it bloats the runtime to over two hours. Swapping out the Ford family from the first instalment for the equally boring Russell's here, the over-seriousness in which their familial turmoil plays out is completely misjudged and unnecessary. Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown are all decent actors, but they're regularly asked to make the dumbest decision available to them and sell it like they're in an Oscar contender. At least Ken Watanabe and Charles Dance are having fun in their ham-fisted roles. Needlessly earnest and po-faced human relationships aside, King of the Monsters delivers impressive blockbuster thrills deserving of a big screen viewing.","7/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","MrDHWong","30 May 2019","Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an action film based on the Toho distributed series of monster films and the sequel to the American 2014 Godzilla film. Directed by Michael Dougherty (Krampus), it is a loud, explosive continuation of the MonsterVerse that delivers just what it promises, both good and bad.Five years after the events of 2014 film, the giant monster Godzilla has been closely tracked by the top secret agency known as ""Monarch"". From what Monarch has observed, Godzilla has no personal interest in purposely hurting humans and only intends to reaffirm his status as King of the Monsters. However, one day the giant three-headed extraterrestrial monster King Ghidorah is awoken from his frozen tomb in Antarctica and sets out to challenge Godzilla's supremacy in an all out fight to the death. To make matters worse, other ancient monsters reawaken as well, including Mothra the flying insectoid and Rodan the Pteranodon, causing mass destruction around the world. With the ever growing challengers for dominance showing up one by one, Godzilla fights his way through his opponents to try reclaiming his place as King, all the while humanity can only watch on in horror.As an improvement over its predecessor, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is pure fanservice for any hardcore fan of the franchise and provides just enough entertainment for newcomers. One common complaint about the 2014 film was Godzilla's lack of screentime and general slow pace. Thankfully, the filmmakers appear to listened to feedback as this film fixes most of that with its quick over-the-top action scenes and, as a result, it is never boring. Unfortunately, most of the human characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. Most of the time, they are only there for the purposes of exposition or to spout some cliched dialogue (""May God have mercy on us all!""). Despite this, the action is fantastic enough to forgive some of it. Watching these iconic giant beasts fight to the death while causing collateral damage to nearby buildings is still incredibly satisfying to see on the big screen. Audiences must also remember that films like this are made as enjoyable popcorn entertainment and not on an intellectual basis. Personally, I place this film in the ""guilty pleasures"" category, alongside the likes of Independence Day and Jurassic World. Be sure to stay after the credits for a bonus scene likely related to the upcoming ""Godzilla vs. Kong""I rate it 7/10","1/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","cardsrock","6 June 2019","For those of you wanting more Godzilla screen time in this movie, you will certainly be happy. He shows up more often and is accompanied by some truly stunning monsters. They are a sight to behold and showcase the movie's terrific visuals. However, I don't come to a Godzilla movie to watch pointless family melodrama. The focus should be on the monsters and while there is more screen time devoted to them in this sequel, there is still way too much time spent following dull human characters. Any time a cool fight scene occurs, the film cuts away to the dumb humans and takes you out of the action. The main takeaway from the film though, and the thing most fans care about, is that the Godzilla fight scenes are fantastic and worth the price of admission.","1/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Alexander_Blanchett","30 May 2019","It was a fine sequel not better or worse than the original. It switches the qualities and flaws of the first one. So here we have much more Monster action, that is really thrilling at times. Really good special effects and many amazing Monster shots. Ghidora is really fantastic and a lot of fun.
The flaw is , in which the first part was stronger, are the characters. There are just very few you really care about or are properly developed.
Kyle Chandler is not really changing his facial expression throughout the whole film. Also Vera Farming has seen much stronger days in her career. Ken Watanabe Is very cartoonish in general. Sally Hawkins was rather useless which was the biggest waste of the entire film. I liked Ziyi Zhang who finally got a role in a Hollywood film again and the best part of the film was Millie Bobby Brown.
The screenplay deserved more work besides the character development as well but for the fact that it purely concentrated on the fight scenes between the titans it was fine enough as it offered many epic moments.","3/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","SkullScreamerReturns","7 December 2020","I kind of like the idea of Godzilla but I have to admit I usually find Godzilla films a bit boring. The plots including human characters don't seem interesting when you want to see giant monsters fighting. But I've usually liked at least the monsters - the oldschool rubber/model creatures.This movie was very boring to me because the the human characters are uninteresting, and their drama and arguing seems dumb considering giant monsters are on the loose. And the computer-generated monsters themselves just don't seem real to me. It's as if they are not there. It's not the worst ever graphics but still makes me feel deceived. Godzilla is supposed to be cool, but this isn't.I liked the fact that there are multiple monsters including King Ghidorah, even though they way they were used wasn't very good. The best thing was that the classic Godzilla theme music was used in a couple of scenes.Not the worst film ever but very empty.","1/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","AhmedSpielberg99","23 June 2020","The cast deserves better than this. Because it's the dynamic between Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe and Ziyi Zhang is what made the scenes they share more tolerable despite some atrocious dialogue and unbearably cringe-worthy one-liners. And because Millie Bobby Brown could have single-handedly made the formulaic dramatic arc work if it wasn't for the fact the film went for the action from the get-go and for almost the entire first 40 minutes, which is basically consists of a set of crammed together segments of non-stop action and explosions which are all devoid of the slightest tension.After showing many monsters on screen, for a reason or no reason, to give those who hated Godzilla what they wanted, the plot began to unravel. But the rest of the movie isn't actually any better. As the more the story proceeds, the clearer it appears how superficial and uninspired it is. I liked both Gareth Edwards's Godzilla and Jordan Vogt-Roberts's Kong: Skull Island, so it's not like I can't stand a mindless creature feature, but this is just extremely poorly made. Even the CGI that most people were praising I found quite disappointing. King Ghidorah, in particular, looks so cartoonish. I mean, Disney's Hercules's Hydra looks more realistic!(3/10)","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","deadprobal","5 June 2019","I dig monster movies. I love the concept of massive creatures that dwarf us. Something that started with my fascination of dinosaurs when I was a kid.
But to say that this movie was a disappointment is a gross understatement! Where are the good story tellers in Hollywood?!The Good:
1. Soundtrack
2. Sound Editing
3. Last minute of the final battle.The OK:
1. Monster design - Nothing spectacular. Especially did not like the design of the main antagonist. Seemed less organic and more of direct attempt to copy a certain design of a certain mythological beast.
2. Cinematography - Nothing new here. Broad sweeps of large areas and landscape, etc.
3. The conclusion.The Bad:
1. Side characters: Seems like the only reason most the side characters to exist was to fill a diversity and gender quota, to pay lip service to current trends. Just give them a few scenes with some dialogue and voila! Job done!
2. Obligatory side characters: ""Hey, we don't have a wise cracking guy..."" - Points randomly at a guy "" You be that guy. And be a .. I don't know...lead scientist. To justify your role.""
3. Dialogue: From the one liners to the nonsensical reactionary conversations, all seem to be very childish with little thought put into it.
4. Main characters: I like some of the actors, but the source material and direction was bad enough to make them seem poor at their jobs.
5. Obligatory roles: It's like the screenwriter/director had a checklist of things needed to do: Gender diversity. Check. Ethnic diversity. Check. Noble sacrificial situation/character. Check. Main character in bad situation to be saved. Check. Etc. Not the worst checklist, but even that didn't help.The Horrible:
1. Character motivations: Nonsensical, poorly portrayed and explained. And the decisions the supposedly intelligent people make are clearly not people with common sense do. Which leads to the next point.
2. Character Settings: The way this movie was likely made. The director/screenwriter wanted to create a tense situation. Doesn't matter if it makes logical sense for the actors involved, make them do stupid things, create an artificially charged situation, and then let them constantly survive again and again when they should have died in the first instance. Want to make us care for the main characters? Same modus operandi.The Unforgivable:
1. Contrivance: If there was ever a category at the Oscars for Contrivance, this movie would get it. If there was ever a Nobel Prize category for Contrivance this would win it! It's that bad. Right from the very first scene , till the end. It keeps getting hammered into the audiences face again and again and again!Honestly, it seemed like the movie was written/directed by a young child who doesn't exactly understand the basic elements of story telling. I didn't care for any of the characters, even those portrayed by actors I like! Even the few monster battles felt unepic for the most part, and dragged on. The main characters getting into impossibly dangerous situations like idiots, and surviving when they shouldn't have. Again and again and again.Never again will I watch a movie made by this director and screenwriter. I can do without the torture. Please don't suffer like I did!","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","totalovrdose","31 May 2019","I was not a huge fan of the 2014 Godzilla, and I know there are many who share my thoughts on that - nuff said. I have been a fan of the franchise since I was a child, owning copies of the original 1954 and 1956 films, alongside having collected copies of multiple sequels throughout the years. To top it off, I still own the figurines my parents used to buy me as a child. In short, my expectations for monster movies are set at a high bar. To get the important stuff out of the way first, Godzilla looks amazing! The special effects in this film are incredible; everything from the movement to the sheer immensity of these creatures being impressive, the bombastic theme, not to mention the outstanding sound effects of the creatures themselves, really bringing them to life, and laying the groundwork for the epic confrontations. Unlike the 2014 film, these are, thankfully, not hidden behind television screens; we are thrust into the conflict, sometimes nose to nose with these behemoths, and you can really feel their proximity.The central conflict is, of course, Godzilla, versus the hydra, Ghidorah, who is an especially vicious antagonist. There are some small, yet great interactions between Godzilla and humanity, that show perhaps a softer side to this humongous brute, as he comes to understand the tiny animals he inhabits the world with, the use of facial motion capture being especially wonderful here; these moments are completely lacking with the unsympathetic Ghidorah, that seems hellbent on world domination - typical bad guy - but what a bad guy he is! Rodan is equally impressive, though it is Mothra who is the most beautiful of all - the musical score accompanying her, not to mention the awe on the faces of those who glimpse her, really accentuates her femininity, which brings about a sense of melancholy whenever she is present. The screen time of these two titans is underwhelming at best...as for the other titans that are present - their screen time is woeful at best - they were merely there for slight window dressing, which is disappointing. Addendum; I felt the tension during the confrontations could have been increased to really hit home the incredible danger that Godzilla faces.The feature opens similarly to the events of Dawn of Justice; we see the climatic battle of the previous film, from the perspective of another; a family who have just lost their son during the preceding struggle. Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) appears to have buried herself in her work since the tragedy, and though she is meant to be attached to her surviving daughter, Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown), who is established as an independent young lady with her own ideas, their relationship is not provided significant depth. If anything, Farmiga's character is a walking, talking inciting incident, used to propel the plot forward. Her husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler) is a far more interesting character. He appears passionate and knowledgeable about nature, which becomes quintessential to the narrative, and though he and Farmiga are meant to be kindred spirits on this topic, the film merely tells us her values, but illustrates his. Unlike his wife, he still appears to be genuinely reeling from the loss of his son, this inner conflict making it hard for him to empathise with Dr. Serizawa's (Ken Watanabe) plan to use Godzilla as humanity's last ditch effort for survival, making for an interesting sub-plot.Monarch again makes an appearance, though the image of it as a conglomerate on the verge of a hostile take-over, as the opening would have you believe, is hardly justified by the story. Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Sam Coleman (Thomas Middledicth) bring some light hearted humour to the film - occasionally these jokes don't land, but it does not detract from their characters, who we do get the chance to see as intelligent professionals. The always lovely Ziyi Zhang, as Dr. Ilene Chen, brings a good dose of wonder about the creatures, being as equally passionate as Dr. Serizawa, though her relationship with doppelganger, Dr. Ling, is never explored. Aisha Hinds, as the colonel of the operation, is continuously calm and collected, making for a believable female protagonist, and even David Strathairn has a cameo, though all of these characters really go to the wayside in contrast with the Russel family. Considering many characters are meant to be scientists, not talking about their areas of study; interests, motivations, and eventual hiring by Monarch, is a wasted opportunity. We are, quintessentially, surrounded by likable strangers for much of the two hour run time.The always entertaining Charles Dance, as Jonah Alan, has a history that is merely glossed over, and though his motivations are revealed, much like his character, they are hardly given significant screen time (and are borderline contradictory). I really wish we could have seen more of him, to get a better understanding of the operation he is launching. By the end of the movie, the place where we leave the humans on is anti-climatic at best - the same, thankfully, cannot be said for the 'monsters'.The movie occasionally suffers from Man of Steel syndrome - we see so much carnage, yet little consideration for the loss of human life. During conflicts involving soldiers, often, protagonists just leave them behind, seemingly unperturbed by their noble sacrifice. The movie also appears to be trying to make an argument about the effects of pollution and the need to save the environment, though considering the number of bombs that go off in this movie - that is hard to swallow.All in all, if you are like me, you will come to see Godzilla, and you will not be disappointed. There are some powerful human moments, one involving Dr. Serizawa and the monster he has been studying all this time is especially a standout. Another is a heated debate between Mark and Emma, where you can literally feel the tension. The movie, of course, like all franchises today, leaves it open for another - and if you wait until the very final end credits scene - what a universe they plan on creating.","10/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Reviews_of_the_Dead","24 January 2020","Now anyone who knows me and my film tastes knows that I loved Godzilla films growing up. I tended to watch the same ones over and over again, but I ended up seeking all of them out as an adult. I remember seeing the 1998 remake with my father and sister in the theater. I enjoyed the most recent remake and the talk of this universe they were building. When hearing about this film, I had to see it. I thankfully got to see it early as a surprise showing was happening at my theater and then a second viewing of it on DVD. The synopsis is the crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.This film starts off back in 2014. In San Francisco when Godzilla was on a rampage there. Since then, the organization Monarch has been seeking out the large monsters to keep track of and monitor them. Their goal to keep them from waking up, but the military is considering just exterminating them to prevent the loss of human life. I should point out here that it is an interesting nod to all of the names of monsters that have some kind of monarchy associated with them as well.There is a family that is torn apart. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his wife Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) lose their son in 2014 during the attack. This drives them apart with Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their daughter, staying with her mother. The two of them are in China monitoring what turns out to be an egg containing the larva of Mothra. Things take a turn when some ecological terrorists attack, freeing Mothra and them taking Emma and Madison.She has created a machine that can stop the monsters with a frequency, but it also can make them angry as well. They use this to free what they are calling Monster Zero, who turns out to be King Ghidorah. This draws Godzilla into battle, but the giant lizard cannot defeat him. The military gets involved and makes things much worse. The terrorist also wake up Rodan from his volcano in Mexico. King Ghidorah wakes up the rest of the known kaijus on the planet, altering the plan of this terrorist group. There is also a secret about the three headed dragon that Dr. Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) thinks she has discovered.Now I wanted to go a bit more vague than usual here. Most of what I recapped is literally within the first 15 minutes of the film. The rest is really at the end of the first act and this really is more about the visuals, than what is happening. That's not to say that we don't get an interesting story surrounding it, at least to me.The first thing I really should talk about is I think a lot of people aren't going to consider this a horror film. I personally don't blame you. I do think that kaiju films are definitely horror adjacent for me. The thought of giant monsters destroying cities and killing all of the people that they do is pretty horrific. Now this film does have some pretty bleak moments, it is no where near as dark as the original Godzilla film was.These films are quite interesting to me, as I think quite a bit of them are fun while they can also be cheesy. This one does have some cheesy lines by some of the characters, especially Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Chief Warrant Officer Barnes (O'Shea Jackson Jr.). I can really let that slide to be honest. What they really need to do is balance the giant monsters fighting and the humans' story. I think this one does that well.The human story is interesting in this as the reason the terrorist group is doing what they are doing is because humans are ruining the planet and as a race we are pretty much garbage. As bleak as stating this sounds, I am 100% in agreement with this. I really like that aspect, because there is a duality between trying to save us while we destroy the planet or allow natural progression to happen with the monsters doing what they are made to do.Going along this story, I absolutely love the concept of incorporating mythology into the lore of these monsters. There are some really cool images that are used to associate with them that I was a big fan of. As a lover of mythology, this was definitely an aspect that really hit home for me.This film does have some really good fights between the monsters as well. I personally love the realism of how all of these giant creatures look and that really made me happy to see. I will say here that it is definitely CGI heavy, which actually turned out to be just fine for me. It never took me out of it which was surprising. I think that the effects in this film are great to be honest.As I kind of touched on a couple of paragraphs up, the balance of the kaijus and the humans is an interesting balance you need. I think that writer/director Michael Dougherty does an excellent job of that. Now I know him from Trick 'r Treat which was a horror anthology and Krampus, where he had to balance different aspects for each film. I think that experience really shines through. Being this film was just over 2 hours, it didn't feel like and I was on-board the whole way. I still think this is a bit long as there is a stretch late in the second act/beginning of the third that slows down. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it though and I never actually got bored. The ending is even interesting alluding to the next film that is supposed to be coming. There are some things with the story though that are kind of plot-holes, but nothing to completely ruin the movie.Acting for the film I thought was really good as well. There is such an interesting cast with Chandler, Farmiga and Brown as the broken family. They all did great. I was glad to see that they used Ken Watanabe, who is an amazing Japanese actor as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. I thought he was great too. Zhang, Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, Jackson and the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well. I could go on and on here, but I won't.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. I saw that Bear McCreary did it I was excited. I first saw his name for The Walking Dead. What I really like about this film though, he incorporated music from the original film and other ones in the series while also doing his own thing as well. It really fit and definitely helped enhance the scenes.Now with that said, I might be running off the high of the film, but I really did enjoy it. I liked how they incorporated a solid social message into this film while giving us what we really want. This was brought to life by great acting and writing for sure. There was a bit of cheesiness to it, but I come to expect that. I think the editing of the film keeps the balance, keeps it interesting and the ending was solid. It is CGI heavy, but it looked. The soundtrack of the film was also helped to enhance the scenes as well. I would have liked to know more about some of the monsters that I didn't recognize, but if these films keep having the success I think they will, they definitely could later. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing. I thought it was really good.","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","garethvk","29 May 2019","Picking up after the events of the previous film; ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" deals with a world trying to assess what to do with the presence of the giant Titans. The Monarch Corporation wants the creatures studied and has established locales to study the ones they have found currently hibernating. The U.S. Government wants them destroyed as they do not want repeats of the destruction that was previously caused by Godzilla.Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobbie Brown) have developed a device known as Orca that will allow them to communicate with the creatures using specific sonic frequencies.After a successful test under duress; the duo are captured by a ruthless Eco Terrorist group who want to use the giant creatures for their own objectives.
This leads to a chase around the world with Monarch attempting to stop them and with Emma's ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) deeply involved though he is deeply divided as he blames Godzilla for the loss of their son.
When a gigantic creature is freed; Godzilla faces his greatest challenge as there is a race against time to save the world.While the film has some very impressive visual effects, the film drags as aside from a couple of brief encounters; the audience is required to sit through roughly 90 minutes of plodding story to get to the action which is roughly only the last 15-20 minutes of the film.The human characters were very disinteresting and many of the international cast looked at times like they were sleepwalking though their lines as they seemed to have a real lack of passion for what they were given to work with.
The human characters were also very annoying and I found myself hoping that they would be taken out by the creatures as I had no connection to them and they did not inspire any sympathy.While it may possibly appeal to hardcore fans, this was a miss for me as there simply was not enough creature action to counter-balance having to sit through the human characters and plodding plot to get to the good stuff.2.5 stars out of 5","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Phil_M_A_Kerr","2 June 2019","The epic scale of this film is unrelenting. There isn't much room for nuanced human emotion when the fate of the world is being duked over by a dozen monsters the size of mountains, no, mountain ranges.
I thought about the origins of the Gozilla story. Why did the Japanese create this creature whose size was beyond any previously imagined? Two things came to mind. Firstly, I thought that the Japanese experience with earthquakes and tsunamis was the core inspiration. Secondly, the atomic bombs dropped on Japan caused a never before seen level of instantaneous destruction of human life and human endeavour. I like to think that I 'felt' this inspiration during the watching of this film. It is just big, big, big, and more biggerer.","10/10"

How I wish he was still here today to have watched this glorious film with me.Baffled by many of the reviews saying to much Kaiju action or poor director etc.This film was clearly made by a dedicated and passionate Godzilla fan. The sheer amount of Easter eggs and fan service which had me grinning is incredible, (yet knowledgeable Godzilla fans on RT seem to not have noticed any of this) and talk about the likes of fire breathing dragons ><!Anyway the film is awesome. One of my favourite films of all time. Definitely my favourite Godzilla film.The effects are incredible.The music is awesome. You will be grinning from ear to ear at certain points.I actually like the human cast. I liked 2014 Godzilla but did not like the main cast Aaron Tailor Johnson. Did not have those issues here. They play imo a good supporting cast to the main cast you care about - The Titans :)!I'm super excited to see what happens next in the monsterverse.Make sure you stay till the VERY end of the credits scene or for a final scene hinting at wha could be to come ;)!I would also encourage you to write a review also should you watch and enjoy the film.

This film is the best Godzilla movie I've seen since the last Vs. Title, Godzilla vs. Destroyah. It has a great storyline with plenty of action, and even some emotional moment's, and the original Godzilla and Mothra themes are played, and there are even throwbacks to both the Mothra and Rodan films themselves!

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","mickdansforth","2 June 2019","The first 1954 Godzilla film is boring.
The 60's/70's stuff is hit and miss with good monster scenes.
The Hanna Barbera cartoon series is FUN!
The 1984 Godzilla movie is solo again and fine. Biolante is weird.
The 90's Toho Goodzilla/Mothra movies is where the series gets good.
The 1998 Tristar movie is it's own thing and enjoyable if you are in the mood to have a good time and overlook things.
The Sony cartoon series justifies the movie and did Destroy All Monsters better than the movie, even with original monsters instead of the Toho ones.
Godzilla 2000 through Tokyo SOS is next level amazing.
The Final Wars set leak photos had us all super excited, but then the weird Matrix stuff in the film was weird and unexpected.
Godzilla 2014 was good.
Kong Skull Island was better and easily the best Kong.
(I haven't yet managed to see Shin and the Netflix anime is weird and intense)
Godzilla King Of The Monsters 2019 is by far the best Godzilla ever.I love the rubbersuit effects of the Toho series, but seeing actual money going into amazing effects is awesome!

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","nmn34","3 June 2019","I am no fan of 2014's Godzilla. I found it to be unworthy of the title, focusing on two other terrible monsters while a block of wood runs around. This still suffers from some of its predecessors flaws, but it does make a good step in the right direction.
The characters aren't great. At least most of them. There are two main actors that nailed their roles, a bunch that are entirely unnecessary, and two who never really lived up to their potential. The good are Dr. Chen (Ziyi Zhang) and Dr Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), they both knocked their roles out of the park as Monarch scientists. They fit the plot well, providing much of the exposition and doing so in a way that is believable. In this world of giant monsters and a hollow earth, which is a bit more loaded than they seem to realize, I feel I can trust they know more than me.
Now that they are out of the way, every other person on their team is utter garbage and had no business in the film. This goes especially true for Dr Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Same Coleman (Thomas Middleditch) who play the exact same role. They are the ""comic relief,"" a phrase I must put in quotes as they are successful at neither of those two words. They never have anything intelligent to add other than to throw out hamfisted lines and be awkward. And to make matters worse, this movie doesn't need such a character. Watanabe and Zhang could have carried this movie even further without their dead weight.
And then there was the unfulfilling characters. The Russel family weren't bad per say, they played their parts well enough but the story didn't feel like it followed through. Emma (Vera Farmiga) played the unenthusiastic villain well and made her daughter's plight more sympathetic. She is ideologically driven but not so lost as to not see the results of what she has done and feel ashamed so you can still empathize for her. Mark (Kyle Chandler) was equally capable as the movie's protagonist. We are learning along side him but he doesn't come across as useless baggage because he provides vital, unorthodox reasoning to any situation. But there should be some emotional weight in Godzilla movies. A character that commits a sacrifice or whose passing should be an emotional low blow, like Daisuke Serizawa's death in the original movie. They try but fail, instead relying on tired Hollywood tropes instead of doing something better with these characters.
Godzilla still needs a slimfast but the main four monsters look great. Mothra is made to look a bit more capable and Rodan, well he never really looked great, but then there is King Ghidorah. He looks like the baddest mother to ever walk the planet. Creating thunderstorms where he stands, hurricanes where he flies, he is a living natural disaster and the greatest threat to everything since Chernobyll. But its even little things about him that make him better, he has personality. Things like the way he glares at people or how his middle head is always picking fights with his left head makes it look like there is much more going on in his head than half the scientists. He is a credit to the special effects team, if only the director had the wherewithal to know where to point the camera in the climactic fight scene. But these are the Japanese monsters, the American originals don't fair all that well. A muto comes back, a spider, a woolly mammoth gorilla hybrid, they don't look so great and probably would have been better off left on the cutting room floor.
In all, I have hope for Godzilla vs King Kong. Maybe they are just needing to make baby steps but the groundwork is there. They just need to know how to swing the bat a little better to knock it out of the park.","10/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kevinxirau","2 June 2019","After years of waiting, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" has arrived, my most anticipated movie of 2019, perhaps more so than ""Avengers: Endgame"" (I know, blasphemy). It's a continuation of the Monsterverse, a shared universe of kaiju consisting of ""Godzilla"" (2014), ""Kong: Skull Island"" and several prequel comics, and is helmed by Michael Dougherty (Trick o' Treat, Krampus). This one promised to show more of the monster action many people craved from the previous film. Does it achieve this? In short, yes.Plot: Five years after Godzilla's battle in San Francisco, the world now knows of the existence of giant prehistoric ""Titans"" and the organization Monarch is doing everything it can to manage it. However, thanks to an eco-terrorist group, Godzilla's most hated enemy, the 3-headed dragon Ghidorah, is freed from his icy prison and threatens global extinction, reigniting their ancient grudge match. Joining this clash of titans are divine insect Mothra and speedy pterosaur Rodan. What can man do but LET THEM FIGHT!I heard complaints about the humans, but if you ask me they're fine. I grew like the new faces as they, though simplistic, offer both amusing and thoughtful banter with returning actor Ken Watanabe giving the best performance. I also found the conflict of the divorced couple (Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler) and their daughter (Milly Bobbie Brown) interesting with their opposing ideals and character arcs. The eco-terrorists, led by Charles Dance, while not given much screen time, are serviceable as villains and emphasize how the darkness of man overshadows the chaos of beasts, making them a dark foil to Monarch. All in their own ways serve the film's central theme of man needing to maintain balance with nature. I do think one or two characters that could've been cut out, though.Of course, the real stars are the monsters and, boy, are they wonderful. Their relationships, powers, designs, and personalities are true to their Japanese incarnations and the effects that bring them to life are stunningly detailed. There are tons of references to both classic films and the previous Monsterverse entries that eagle-eyed fans will easily spot. Furthermore, the established lore is expanded upon to fascinating areas such as the titans' history with man and mythology while offering room for more exploration. The action scenes up the ante with the monsters literally ripping each other apart in savage fights and worldwide destruction (refreshing locations like Mexico and Boston included), sometimes seen from the humans' POV to truly showcase their size and power. Compared to 2014's darker lighting, the titans' glow and distinct colors make the fights easier to see. The music is a spine-chilling blast, classic themes from past films (particularly Godzilla's and Mothra's) updated and combined with a tribal-style choir chanting the monsters' names to give a sense of awe, wonder, and dread for these giants (about time since previous U.S. adaptations neglected to do this) as well a remake of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Go Go Godzilla"".The humor is really the one thing to me that's hit-or-miss with some jokes being ""meh"" while others did make me chuckle.The team behind this film are true fans who went out of their way to make this a dedicated tribute to the franchise. It made my inner child giddy and I can't wait to see ""Godzilla vs Kong"". By all means, this MUST be seen on the big screen. All hail the King of the Monsters!","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","anupapu8","2 June 2019","GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS:- I don't understand , just don't understand why people are not that much into Kaiju (Big Badass Monsters) movies. Both GODZILLA (2014) & KONG: SKULL ISLAND (2017) were awesome movies , but both did just fine at the box office , just fine with the critics and just fine on IMDB page. Right now KING OF MONSTERS is at 49% on Metacritics and 6.9/10 on IMDB. Thats exceptionally low. Also KING OF MONSTERS just opened with lower numbers in comparison to both previous installment , and its actually better then both those awesome movie.But lets just talk about the movie , not the box office numbers. Its literally grand , really grand in its scale. Easily the biggest movie of this summer , even bigger then ENDGAME. By the way, on side note, i liked it more then ENDGAME which had major loopholes in it. Now the writing in this movie is no OSCAR material. But there was no need for that. The writing was just enough to justify the fight scenes. In-fact sometimes it surprises you too. The theme was Dark too. Jokes were evenly spread. Not too much on the nose like some MARVEL movies. The concept of Environmentalism was SPOT ON. Very much makes you think , IS THE VILLAIN ALTOGETHER WRONG ? OR IF THERE IS SOME LOGIC IN HIS/HER ACTIONS ? I totally loved the motives of Human villains. They were never meaningless. Although the character of Charles Dance along with the dialogues given to him as the villain were pretty boring (in-fact i think he was the only boring or bad (whatever u prefer to call it) character in the movie. But the other villain which was almost spoiled by the trailers still i will not say it upfront did a SPOT ON (yes i am gonna use this particular adjective again and again in this review).All the actors have done really fine job , and their characterization were decent too except again Charles Dance and Sally Hawkins to some extent. With Ken Watanabe and Vera Farmiga being the best. Ken Watanabe being one of the character returning from the first movie really got one exceptionally awesome emotional scene. His pain and happiness at the same time went right through my heart, it was almost poetic.Lets talk about the CGI. It was just SPOT ON (yes for the third time now). Not a single bad effect. Not a single scene looked like its was not real. I mean even movies like ENDGAME , INFINITY WAR and AQUAMAN had some scenes where everything looked CGI-ed , but this movie had just the perfect CGI.The creatures were great. I felt RODEN was used for a little less time then what was needed. But whatever he was used for they were great. Specially the Mexico chase, i mean WAOW. The CGI was very creative there. The creatures were shown to have their own brain instead of being just DUMB WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTIONS. When it comes to beauty , nothing can be more beautiful then MOTHRA. U are never gonna get to see a Giant creature as beautiful as her in that much of a size. She was a work of art. But then again , nothing in this movie can be compared to the fight scenes between GODZILLA and GHIDORA . I can see a whole movie without any storyline just these creatures being fighting. it was that great. The MOTION CAPTURE technique used (same as in case of GODZILLA 1 and KONG) really makes a difference with the character of GODZILLA. He felt much more real which makes the CGI SPOT ON (and there goes the 4th time).Small thing to consider, Millie Bobby Brown's character was really good in the movie. Usually this kind of movies have dumb children to taken care of , rescued and always getting in troubled. but her character took some really important and brave steps in the film, becoming one of the most important character in the movie.So basically for me , except the character of Charles Dance , the movie was SPOT ON (i know 5 times is too much). loved almost everything about it. A true blockbuster film with extraordinary action scenes , top notch CGi , decent characters and more than enough writing.Also i watched it on a IMAX SCREEN. And believe me when i say it, U SHOULD DO THE SAME.8.5/10by ANuP APu KuMaR","8/10"

Why would Charles Dance associate his name with this crap?","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Carycomic","31 May 2019","And it was well worth sitting through all two hours and fifteen minutes!The movie begins by referencing the 2014 film (with Bryan Cranston) the same way BvS: DAWN OF JUSTICE referenced MAN OF STEEL. With a flashback told from a slightly different point of view. Namely; a pair of Monarch cryptozoologists whose only son became one of the thousands of innocent by-standers killed in the epic struggle between Godzilla and those giant scarabs.Fade in, and its five years later. With the couple now divorced...and the mother having full custody of their late son's younger sister.What follows is more-or-less a spy-fi thriller that has more twists and turns than a gyrating Mothra catepillar. At the same time, it also shows that monsters don't have to be gigantic bugs or lizards with radioactively-based super powers. They can also be (and more often are) so-called ""human beings"" fanatically--or, at the very least, misguidedly--determined to commit the worst crimes imaginable for the so-called ""greater good.""Similar to Hitler ordering the genocide of six million Jews for the ""greater good"" of Germany.For those who just want a good dai-kaiju fight, with state-of-the-art special effects, you'll get your money's worth. But, for those who prefer a little human interest as a subplot to their escapist science fiction? You'll enjoy it, as well.So go see it.","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","travisvincent","13 August 2019","Godzilla King Of The Monsters is bigger, brighter and louder than 2014 Godzilla. Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah-Monster Zero are impressive to see. The CGI is incredible. The human storyline and family drama is wasted and unnecessary. At one point in the movie as one parent says goodbye, it's supposed to be an emotional moment but it doesn't land. I'm not sure why these big budget monster movies keep insisting on a human storyline-we've come for the monsters, the spectacle not a lifetime movie. Overall I liked this one a lot, and you will too if your a big Godzilla fan, if you're not, you probably won't get all the details and nuances. As far as monster movies goes, it's worth the watch.","1/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Endless_01","3 June 2019","After the devastation of Godzilla's awakening, years later we meet again but now with the whole team of the main Kaijus in action, Rodan, Mothra, Godzilla and the nemesis, King Ghidora. All ready to face each other in a brutal battle for supremacy among the titans.This movie is the dream of any Godzilla fan come true, a surprising reimagination of the apocalyptic fight between these giants. The action and cinematography are completely synchronized to present epic moments of combat in gigantic proportions. I think in a movie of this kind it's not much about talking about the characters or the script, since what we really want is to see giant monsters fighting, and admit it, we love to see that.Godzilla 2 does it completely, the scenes are fantastic, apocalyptic and full of emotion, above all, is a complete satisfaction for the most veteran fans, the design of each kaiju is incredible and fully respects the originals, using its main structure and sounds, giving us a full ticket to reimagine our childhood once again.I love kaijus, and if you love them too, you will love this movie, because the roar of the king is back, and this time to stay. Long live the king.","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","TheBabayaga","2 June 2019","King of the Monsters, at least from a technical perspective, is monstrously epic in scope and sheer destruction. The monsters themselves, especially Mothra, come alive in great detail.Michael Dougherty clearly listened to the viewers who complained about the lack of 'Zilla in the 2014 movie, and to make up for that there is Godzilla galore in this sequel. King of the Monsters isn't as subtle or as restrained as Gareth Edwards' version but here the pace is faster, the action bigger and louder whilst the acting, especially from Ken Watanabe, is competent.The story however, is convoluted and absolutely ludicrous at times, and it was annoying to see characters globe trotting off screen between China and Antarctica and then Mexico and Boston of all places. Not only that but some of the monsters, especially Rodan, were completely wasted despite their prevalence in the trailers. These however, are small niggles.Anyone who wants to watch Godzilla wants to see monsters smashing the hell out of each other and for that you couldn't ask for more with this movie.","1/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","threecuzs","9 June 2019","It was awful! Long boring dialogues which is unfortunate because the cast is a very good one. Love all the actors, but even that didn't make it better. Monster fights were in the dark. Godzilla didn't show until the half end of the movie. The plot line and the ending was predictable. I wish the movie was more about astonishing monster fights and less terrible boring dialogue lines. It was so boring that an actual guy was snoring. I wish I saved money to watch something else.","6/10"

Watch Shin Godzilla if you like believing what you see or Final Wars if you like unbelievable over the top fun movies. King of Monsters wants to be both and is neither. It tries to be dramatic and serious while being over-the-top-fun and misses both targets. It's both unbelievable and boring.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","lan-75831","2 June 2019","It hits a lot of the moments from the original Kaiju films and still expands off it in a bigger way. The diversity of the cast, the monster's designs were so well done, and the score was amazing. The agility of the story and the brilliant set up of the battle sequences really draws your attention. Its the biggest summer monster blockbuster film of the year that you cannot miss on the big screen.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Borgenschatz","30 May 2019","If you went to watch this movie expecting deep human character development and plot lines you clearly have never seen any Godzilla movies beyond the 2014 & 1994 one. This movie pays tribute to what Toho was known for and that's the fight scenes.
A lot of reviews pointing out all the flaws basically described without realising it, what a classic Godzilla is supposed to be like.
As a long time fan I can safely say that nobody watches Godzilla for the humans. The cheesy plot lines only add to the whole movie and make it a fun and memorable experience.
If you watched this movie expecting some Oscar worthy performances and emotional connections and plot twists, you clearly have no idea what the classic Toho movies were like?Who goes into a Godzilla movie expecting something on the level of Schindler's List?","7/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","arskhemnanilack","29 May 2019","Right off the bat, this movie takes off quickly from the very beginning of it. Things begin to get going, and it sets up for this basic and simple story. However, everything in the second half completely changes and turns terribly. The story just doesn't make enough sense, with tons of twists and turns which don't suit the situation of the film. The second half is atrocious, and starts throwing characters away left and right and they didn't even make audiences care for any of them. This was easily what brought the movie so far down, and ruined it. They tried to add humor multiple times, but it just never worked and nobody even laughed at any of the jokes. The characters are also very clearly used as story points, and they feel so unrealistic. They also make very dumb decisions, and many things happened that just didn't make any sense or couldn't be possible. For instance, one of the characters had their hand smashed onto by a huge stone building, and then used their hand perfectly fine afterwards. I could go on for days about what's terrible about this movie, but there are a few good things. Millie Bobby Brown's character was maybe the only one that could be semi-cared about. This movie has a huge budget of $200,000,000 and other than spending it on their impeccable all-star cast, it was mainly spent on CGI. This was so clear right from the first few scenes. The CGI was absolutely stunning, and the monsters feels more powerful than ever. Everything looked visually realistic and appealing. I could only name about 2 scenes that had somewhat bad CGI. The monsters are easily the best part of the film without a doubt, they're also taken very seriously. It doesn't make the commin monster movie mistake by using the monsters for dumb humor or anything like that, you can feel the power of these monsters, and when there's action, is when this movie shines the most.","7/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","jeffcour","22 October 2019","The performances of the actors are sometimes cringe-worthy, and no one expects any of them to receive Oscar nominations. But who cares? This movie is two hours of ridiculous, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping, eye-popping fun. Forget the critics. The fans have spoken. This movie is an absolute blast, watching ginormous monstrosities battle each other and destroy major cities in the process. The visuals are unbelievable. It is without question one of the greatest monster movies ever made. You can feel the enormity and heft of these creatures. The cinematography is staggering, mind-blowing. Pop some popcorn, grab a cold drink, sit down and enjoy this remarkable film. Have fun!","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","josiahliljequist","4 June 2019","Now look, if you came to this movie expecting any logic or interesting plot elements or character development, you came to the wrong movie. What I wanted to see was awe inspiring creatures do battle and at that it succeeds, albeit imperfectly. All the monsters were well designed, especially Mothra, and the battles were fairly well constructed. I do wish that more focus had been on the kaiju vs kaiju action, instead of needless pandering of the human characters. But at its best, this movie made me feel like a little kid watching in awe of such behemoths before me, and that is a great compliment indeed.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","mcgenge","3 June 2019","This movie has absolutely stunning visuals, cinematography and sound mixing. It was so spectacular I didn't want to blink during action scene not to miss anything. Creative fight coreographies and amazing power balancing. It's a must watch on IMAX.On the other hand the human part was even more terrible than I expected. The story itself wan't that bad but the execution was more than chaotic. I won't even mention the immortality of the main characters or the teleportations, or the Sherlock Holmes like skills of the Dad. But the super illogical behavior of the female lead, the 2D personalities and the supe-cringe-worthy dialogues were perfect to throw you off every time.However I didn't go for the human drama, I was ready for a clich√© - but not a bad written clich√©. Still, CGI secenes are amazing so I had a lot of fun watching it, would recommend to anyone who's into ground-breaking CGI orgies.","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","thisseatofmars","2 June 2019","The 2014 version of Godzilla was not great, but this 2019 take, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, is superb. Many wonderful moments, with some strokes of genius.I know what you're thinking. ""Genius"" may be an overused and often incorrectly used term, like ""epic,"" but I can't think of a better way to describe how the filmmakers gave the three different heads of King Ghidorah their own unique personalities. Ghidorah is the big scary kaiju of the movie, and Godzilla's eternal rival, but he's not just a simple, mindless hydra: the middle head is dominant, the right head is no-nonsense and follows orders, and the left head is something of a ditz, who needs to be put in place. The different personalities is a wonderful quality to give to Ghidorah because it complements his personality and his design. (And, it also makes me think of the three-headed giant from Monty Python's Holy Grail.) The presentation of the monsters is also done with wonderful care, and many sequences, like Rodan waking, and Godzilla arriving with the military (and the girl smiling when seeing him), were excellent.The 2014 Godzilla movie suffered because the movie focused on a bland human and his bland family instead of, you know: the titanic beasts walking the Earth. This 2019 film is far superior because the humans add to the experience rather than get in the way. The cast is generally very good and Charles Dance is here, who is a supreme actor, and his post-credits scene is perfectly delivered.There is one scene that I especially loved: when the humans lure Rodan towards King Ghidorah, and the screen turns black, only for it to flash white, showing Ghidorah in all his serpentine glory, and white light flashing on the Chinese scientist's shocked face. I loved that moment. When I think of this film in the future that moment will be the first of the first images that come to mind. It's moments like these that we go to the movies, and stay with you long after.That said, the humans still sort of get in the way of the action. It's wonderful seeing the monsters; everything, in fact, about the monsters: seeing them appear, seeing their eyes, seeing them fight- even watching them move around is a treat: but the humans get in the way at times, which can annoy. In the climactic battle at the end, the camera is focused on the family more often that I liked, but the battles are all still engrossing and satisfying. Godzilla going nuclear and totalling Ghidorah was great, and he is ushered in via a very tough-cool line, delivered by a human: ""Long live the king.""There's also a scene that irked me: a statue of a soldier falling down. It was very quick, but unpleasant all the same, given the tension around statues of soldiers and historical figures in cities now. However, this film does a good job giving credit to soldiers. The soldiers in this film are competent, hardworking, and brave, and also human: they crack jokes, and one even blesses himself. Also, there's a nice scene between Ken Watanabe, a Japanese actor, and Ziyi Zhang, a Chinese actress, where their characters hug in an emotional and meaningful way. Given the history between their two countries, this moment of peace was especially nice.I love, love, love Godzilla and the whole genre of kaiju movies. I still consider Pacific Rim the absolute finest kaiju film ever made, but Godzilla: King of the Monsters comes second. It's nice to leave the cinema with a smile on my face: I guess not everyone in Hollywood is a twisted pervert with a political agenda (we can only hope). I'm grateful I live in a time where kaiju movies are so well done. ""Let others praise ancient times; I am glad I was born in these.""","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","frobrojkt","3 June 2019","I have been a ""huge"" Godzilla fan for basically as long as I can remember, and I must admit this is arguably one of the best ""Godzilla"" movies ever made!!After the 2014 Legendary film I was admittedly a little apprehensive going into King of the Monsters. But it did not disappoint. There is tons of destruction, tons of monsters, and tons of homages to previous Godzilla films. First, the sounds all the kaiju made were spot on, albeit modernized. The visual eye candy is constant. The creature design was truly ah inspiring.
Bear McCreary's score is absolutely incredible!! Full of homages to original themes by Ikufube (probably spelled wrong).
If you go to this movie expecting a kaiju smashfest overflowing with homages and fan service then this is the movie for you!!Now for my critiques: The story IS lacking and a little disjointed. The acting is pretty good, although there are a couple poorly delivered lines. You never quite fully understand the motivations behind characters. My overall feelings about most of the critiques on this page are justified. However, this leads me to my main point. This is a kaiju movie.. what are you honestly expecting ? Are you expecting academy award winning performances ? Are you expecting a Christoffer Nolan masterpiece? No, or at least you shouldn't be. The hard core critics of this film are being critical for the sake of being critical. This is a monster movie, you are going to get lots of monsters, explosions, and creature violence. That is kinda the point.Anyway, long story short, this is a flawed movie from a critical stand point. There are weak points, and strong points. But again I reiterate the point, THIS IS A MONSTER FILM!! if you are going into this film to be entertained and have a smashingly great time, then please go and I think you will have fun. But if you are expecting something more from this film (that no kaiju film in the history of cinema has delivered btw) then I think you should avoid this film.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","sheridan-turner","31 May 2019","Finally......got it right!Godzilla 2014 was pretty good but a bit boring....and had more people talking and not enough action.Godzilla: King of the Monsters more than made up for that!It was action packed....and it had heart. This time the story made sense, and the people seemed to be in tune with what was going on. No stupid love story trying to appeal to your emotions.I liked how certain scenes paid homage to the Japanese Godzilla movies by using some of the same references and music. He was pretty bad ass at the final fight scene. It reminded me of the Japanese fight with ""Destroyah"", if you saw that one. For true Godzilla fans, you will hear and recognize many clues and references. Have to say though, Mothra was a bit small if you ask me.
The military were decently portrayed, but some things were a bit off. For example, you won't see a Full Bird Colonel running around like a Sergeant leading a strike team into a hot zone. Not typically anyway.All in all, my wife stayed awake for the entire move, so that says a lot!Great job guys and gals!!!Cannot wait to see the next installment!","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","JamesIan2021","31 May 2019","The film could've chopped out 10 minutes of mostly exposition, removed 5 or so characters and relegated the soldiers to just background characters, as King of the Monsters does slightly suffer from overstuffing from time to time, but everything about this mighty sequel defines big, dumb blockbuster fun. I was munching on my popcorn like a little kid every time something big happened, and that may sound vague but I'm sure you can guess what I mean.This movie is basically at 130 minute light show, a blast of cinematic spectacle with dozens of mouth-watering shots that could easily be your next computer wallpaper. Most the performances work, especially Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler, but let's face it, we're here for monumental destruction and titan smackdowns, and boy do you get those!Godzilla is fully-realised, with character and presence, and he roars about 15 times here and it made me cheer with giddy abandon, I turn into a wide-eyed kid watching monster movies and this one had me jaw dropped and blown away consistently with the phenomenal battles involving the menacing Ghidorah, the deadly Rodan and the beautiful Mothra, plus other briefly seen titans that each have a distinct look and threat about them.The set design is so cool, it reminded me of Roland Emmerich's 2012, in that these governments and giant companies own groovy high tech facilities, epic ships, complete with expensive monitors and satellites, it's all very cheesy and B-movie but it made the movie even more entertaining in that there's thought put into every scene and environment, and the aesthetics and mood of Godzilla's hidden home in hollow earth added some much-needed atmospherics to the film.The finale of this film almost rivals the awe and chaos of the 2014 Godzilla flick, and I absolutely loved the relatively lengthy unbroken shots of the humans running through destroyed Boston as Ghidorah and Godzilla beat each other up whilst Rodan and Mothra go at it! It's explosion and action movie heaven, my ears were ringing by the end of this movie and I left exhausted in the best possible way.Now it's the wait for Godzilla vs Kong, this franchise needs to keep going this good!","1/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","annekehensley","3 June 2019","Despite having never been TOO big of a Godzilla fan in my life, at least not to the extent of many people, this movie delivered a good time. I feel like it was a major step up from Godzilla (2014), which to me was already pretty damn good of a movie. This one was by no means perfect, but it was dramatic and intense and had scenes that made me smile, frown, jump a little in my seat, and leave me begging to see more.
The CGI graphics are PHENOMENAL. The team clearly knew what they were doing, everything was recorded well and seemed so real. A movie that felt like even the staff had fun making those scenes. The actors were great too, though I feel that anyone will be more attached to the titanic monsters that capture the spotlight more than anyone else.
If you're thinking of going to see it, then do. If you like Godzilla, or if you even just like loud, well-designed action movies with fantasy monsters, you HAVE to see this one.","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","capcanuk","1 June 2019","Let's start with some simple ground rules:
1) if you don't like monster movies, do NOT go see this film. You won't like it. It's... a monster movie.
2) if you're looking for subtle drama, interpersonal relationships, depth and realism worthy of an Oscar, do NOT go see this movie. it's not that kind of film, it's a MONSTER MOVIE.
3) If you're a pretentious snob who only likes slow-burn foreign, subtitled films, well, I think you can fill in the rest of what I was going to write.On to the review (I will attempt not to have any spoilers):Despite what some others, who gave the film low ratings, wrote, the performances are solid all the way through. I would even say that they are better than Samuel L. Jackson's scene-chewing in Kong: Skull Island (gotta admit, however, that he was a great ""villain"" in that movie).Storywise, this is very much like all the TOHO Gojira films, in the sense that the stories tend to be a bit convoluted. You go into a Godzilla movie expecting a certain degree of ""cheese"" in the whole affair. But the American versions don't quite go as far with it, which is a nice change of pace. They treat the material with a bit more respect than expected.For those who complained about the paucity of Godzilla in the 2014 film (it actually had more Godzilla screen-time than the 1954 original version), well, this film makes up for it with LOTS of monster time on screen.
It also really helps that these are four of the most iconic monsters from this particular monsterverse.Effects: Both a pro and a con for me. The effects were absolutely breathtaking for the most part. Yes, Mothra is absolutely awe-inspiring. Ghidora is amazingly well rendered. Godzilla is perfect. But for some odd reason, Rodan (by the way, always my favourite monster from the TOHO collection) is less convincing. I don't know what exactly it was about him, but he had that ""man in a rubber suit"" look despite being entirely CGI.Another minor complain has to do with the way the monsters were filmed. Where the 2014 film succeeded like no other by really leaving us with a sense of the MASS of these monsters, In G:KotM there were too many parallel shots, scenes filmed from ""monster head level"" which had the disadvantage of drawing the viewer away from the scale of the monsters. You really had less of a sense of the massive sizes involved because you were too close to them, too removed from a human-scale point of view. At least, it felt this way to me. Not every scene, most were perfect, but a few, and unfortunately, most were in the climactic final battle sequence.Very, very minor spoiler here: two major characters die (it's a monster movie, SOMEONE has to die, right?), and my only complaint is that not enough time was given to the audience to really ingest the impact of those two moments. Had the film tacked on an extra 10-15 minutes, and allowed us a bit more time to ""feel"", at least to me, it would have been better.Bear McCreary's score to the film was fun, and included references to musical themes from a few of the original TOHO movies (Mothra's theme in particular, which has a very emotional impact). And of course, the original Godzilla theme which has tremendous impact and raises the excitement level. It's not as original a score as that for the 2014 film (which SHOULD have been one of the ""Best Score"" Oscar contenders), but I was very impressed that McCreary was able to pull off such a huge, symphonic, and EFFECTIVE score for the film.I saw the film on an IMAX screen, no 3D. And I was blown away. It is definitely meant to be seen on a huge screen.
Somehow, I suspect that the 3D element is probably superfluous, so I would not say ""you have to see it in 3D"".This is a fun film, a huge, loud, exciting film. And for fans of the original TOHO movies, it's loaded with winks and nods and allusions. There's even a major plot point from the 1954 Gojira that becomes an integral part of the action in this film.It's beautifully shot, a BIT on the dark side (and those who complained that the film was too dark MAY have the 3D to blame for that), and the colour palette is a tiny bit too restricted for my taste, but well worth watching anyways, and eventually a definite addition to my Bluray collection.","4/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","LoboKurg","15 December 2023","The crutch to all these films is always all the people. Side characters constantly saturate these movies with needlessly crappy and convoluted side plots, bad scripts, and terrible decisions. Adding more military elements to this film didn't help much either, because its cringely apparent the director had zero knowledge of the subject matter and didn't bother to source an advisor. As a result, we see clashes between human factions that are equally idiotic, and we get shots of rifle optics that are clearly just camera overlays, among other lazy oversights that distract from the rest of the movie.At the end of the day, we eventually get what everyone came to see, a monster fight. ""Let them fight"" couldn't be more on the mark, and the director should have taken a lesson from that line.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","paullewisborman","13 December 2021","Halfway through this movie I'm wondering why I'm still watching it, then it occurred to me - it was because I couldn't believe they got halfway through making it and could be bothered to finish it.Every possible cinematic cliche is reanimated in Frankensteinian fashion, no dialogue too hackneyed or caricature too stereotyped.It is like the director is taunting you to turn the thing off and walk out, this is not a film, it is a battle of wills.It's only redeeming feature being it is perfect material for Mystery Science Theater 3000 to lampoon for the entertainment of future generations.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","gregthmann","29 May 2019","After watching a few subtitled Japanese Godzilla films and loving them, I was keen as mustard to see the 1994 Godzilla film and felt betrayed with the American handling of this franchise! Move on 20 years and a significant step up and a real homage to the franchise was paid but still lacked enough ""Wow"" time with the monsters fighting (still a great film and good acting but missing the budget perhaps?)Move to King of the monsters and it is OMFG time!!! It starts out a little slow but does the right thing in character building. Then it is showtime and MAN, I was not disappointed at all. It genuinely felt like I was watching gigantic monsters fighting and destroying building. I was taken back to Pacific Rim and how big they looked but this does it even better in my opinion.Without giving spoilers, if like me, you enjoy a good 'Giant monsters fighting film', you will not be let down at all. Sound is amazing also and well worth watching in IMAX. Ohhh and as a heads up... Stay til the very end credits for a Marvel-esque treat!","3/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","smilyst","1 July 2021","From reading other reviews it sounds like they got some of the philosophical aspects of Goszilla correct, but that doesn't excuse such a crappy final product.The human drama was so poorly written, yet it dominated the entire film. The writing was terrible! Why was the crappy drama 70% of the film (and I usually like drama) when this was supposed to be a monster fight movie??? The monster fights were probably only 20 minutes of this 2 hour movie. There were 17 monsters, and only 20 minutes of fighting??? How do you fail that much?I consider story to be the most important aspect of any film. And that is why this movie was such trash. I wasn't expecting any story, and that would have been WAY better! The story/drama was so poorly written. The directing was so poor. I feel sorry for the actors who had to work with such a piss poor director.Conclusion: Go watch Pacific Rim. You will hate yourself less afterwards.","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","dmcoleman-23036","5 June 2019","... Something Hollywood gets wrong again and again when they attempt a godzilla revamp. The hammy supporting crew are given wayyy too much airtime to blandly expose the ridiculous plot of this film, and it is excrutiating in parts.
Why is EVERY female character rocking the ice cold, androgynous thing? Is that what happens when humanity is suffering kaiju induced extinction? Is it just me? Probably.
Again, why, do they bring back two of the main characters from the last film, only to pointlessly kill them both off? You have to assume the actors had a say in that, who can blame them.The acting isnt the only painful part of this movie. The visual effects in the early sequences are blatantly sharknado quality, obscured by darkness, shaky camerawork and ""weather conditions"" similar to a poorly tuned 1970's analog TV. I could barely see what was happening and I'm certainly not the only one.The last saving grace was probably the final 15 minutes, where the beasts finally took centre stage, seemingly directed by a different eye, someone who understands and loves the source material. Half the budget must have been spaffed on the end battle alone, hence the incoherent mess we're made to suffer through to get to that point.I love Godzilla. But the big guy clearly doesn't translate to modern cinema. Please, no more. Keep it to comic books and retire this incarnation.","1/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Sabaher","2 June 2019","I think this movie probably delivers most and the best monster destruction. We get this whole gallery of monsters from the Godzilla universe rising from the ground and these titans battle it out starting early in the film and all the way to the end. It moves at a nice brisk pace because of that. It develops the sense of urgency early on in the film involving the human subplot and then in the first half of the film the monsters are unleashed and destruction begins. As it is a Godzilla movie Godzilla gets in the action at the beginning, middle, and a big fight at thre end of the film. We get to explore him a little bit more as a character. I also appriciated that this film dove into the deep end of mythology of this world with monsters being around for a while, ancient civilisations, MONARCH and all of the many different bases throughout the globe. There's a bunch of things about this film that I really enjoy. We spend a lot of time with our human characters, but they're all played by great actors that can deliver really ridiculus exposition and stupid lies in a way that it sounds kind of convincing, but that leads to our big problem here is that the scrips is not good. There's just so many holes inside of the logic. The characters are all basically a job and a single personality trait. That's all of them. They just got a great actor to try to perform that, but there's just no depth to anyone. Also the monster action, though there's plenty of it, is shot so often in close-up or from the perspective of humans that it doesn't have the right effect that it should. It's not as exciting as it should be even though there's a lot of it. So this is a movie that is very frustrating because of the mistakes it made were, even though it's got a great cast and plenty of monster action, which is what we go to the movies like this to see","10/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","CrookedNose94","4 November 2019","Maybe not, but ranks very high on the list. Godzilla: King of The Monsters is basically just a reaction video where many different actors are shown in close-up shots while they witness unfathomably large creatures topple hundreds of buildings and kill thousands. Now THAT'S filmmaking.Ask yourself: Do you like multi-trillion-dollar underwater mega facilities? Multi-trillion-dollars of super jets and aircraft? Do you like corny CGI in every imaginable shot possible? Do you like scripts that are preformed like they were written by ten-year-old? If so, this is DEFINITELY the movie for you.One of my biggest problems with movies like this is that we've seen all of this happen before in action movies. Too formulated!The ""film"" (animation) is:-50% Reaction shots
-10% Actual god-sized monsters fighting in slow-mo
-10% Super unrealistic ideals and moral compasses
-10% Stranger Things
-10% Nods toward another sequel (Godzilla Vs. Kong)
-7% Actually cool action sequences
-3% Mexican standoffs.Oh yeah and 1% logic. Can't forget the logic!","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","chester129","1 February 2020","I realize this is a Godzilla movie and he is the king, but my favorite is Mothra and she is the queen! She is the first 'monster' shown - in her larva form. But she is such a legend, even in this form. When the men try to stop her, she kicks their asses.Mothra should have been in this movie MUCH more. Really, she isn't in it very much. She has a beautiful moment helping a 'dead' Godzilla. As amazing and beautiful as she is, she also is a fighter. She is the one that takes down Rodan...in a truly amazing battle. My fave thing of her is her expressions...she shows when she is mad as hell!!!Of course, my least fave moment is when she is killed by Ghidorah. But even in death, she powers up Godzilla. If you watch at the end, the news reports that a mysterious egg appeared. So.... let's hope she resurfaces!!!The movie is amazing. I know it sounds pathetic, but I was very emotional watching it the first time. Just watching the monsters go at it, it was such a beautiful moment! Godzilla was ok, he is not my fave. Ghidorah was ok....I truly didn't want Ghidorah to be defeated, but the post credit scene makes me think he will be back. I love Rodan...especially when he first appears. As much as I loved him, I mentioned how satisfying it was to see Mothra take him down.Many people have a problem with the 'humans.' I am a huge Kyle Chandler fan, so I loved every scene he was in. Millie Bobby Brown was overhyped! She was ok, but nothing special. Vera Farmiga was ok, her character was hard to figure out. Ken Watanabe was a highlight. I was drawn to every word he said...and his 'ultimate' moment was amazing! And I suppose I should mention Charles Dance...his character was perfectly evil (but I never watched Game of Thrones, so he was just another guy).So, ultimately my assessment of this movie is....it is perfection. It's one of my top 3 movies of the year. The monsters: Godzilla, Ghidorah, Rodan and of course Mothra....they were the stars. Other monsters appeared at the end...but they weren't important to the plot. Some say it has bad writing, but it is a monster movie....accept it for that and you will be happy!!One last thing I will say....the trailers showed WAY TOO MUCH. There were 3 trailers (or maybe 4), but they showed too much. The first 2 were great. But the last trailer actually showed Mothra getting killed. I mean, come on.... why show such a big moment in a trailer?!? Show some, show a lot, but don't show everything!!","9/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","srivastavaaakash","4 June 2019","Wooow...Kudos to the director who gave us this awesome movie. I would like to mention here the CGI and the music, they uplifts the whole experience of the movie. I went to IMAX and boy o boy i made the right decision. The sound effects were awesome.. especially when they open up the shaft gate under the sea and Godzilla turns past the shaft...very chilling scene. Story wise it was totally watchable...there are some, who wanted a godfather type drama in the movie...its their bad that is why they are disappointed by the plot. For a regular viewer this movie story was very much watchable. Common this is a moster movie. We got so much of Godzilla on screen this time with other monsters, I can't complain. I would urge everyone to go and watch this in thetre. And yes, please go without any prejudice in mind. You will definitely enjoy it.
And don't listen to critics and websites like rotten tomato....I really don't know what they were thinking before writing the bad review.

There were some genuinely amazing visuals which really paint the picture of Godzilla as this monstrous beast but at his heart that of a true god like creature. Fantastic.The human element was great too, the acting was decent and the story was one of strong character arcs and well thought through motivations and conflicts.I think people will genuinely be debating if this is the best Godzilla movie now, it is definitely in contention for that title.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","bkoganbing","8 June 2019","Dressed up with an awesome budget and 3-D which version I saw, Godzilla King Of Monsters is a throwback to those old Japanese monster fests when Godzilla
and all his pals were laying waste to most of urban Japan. Godzilla originally
a villain monster became a leader to other of these titanic creatures as they
battled Ghidrah the hydra head bad guy from outer space.Ghidrah's back too and he and Godzilla slug it out in of all places Boston with
Fenway Park as ground zero.There's a human cast too, but like in the Japanese films they take second place
to the computer graphic generated big guys.It's big and it's awesome, but doesn't have the same sense of fun as the Japanese created creatures destroying those cardboard sets.","7/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","shawneofthedead","29 May 2019","THE LOW-DOWN: With Marvel raking in the cash and plaudits after creating the world's most epic cinematic universe, every studio that can thread movies together - however tenuously - is hopping on the bandwagon. And so we have Godzilla II: King Of The Monsters: the third installment in Legendary Pictures' MonsterVerse, following Godzilla (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017). It's easily the most ambitious film yet, uniting several classic critters straight out of Godzilla lore and finding pretty much any excuse to have them fight one another. The final result is both bold and bonkers - good and bad, often in the very same moment.THE STORY: Monsters break stuff, including people. It's a fact of life that the broken Russell family must deal with after Godzilla's epic battle leaves downtown San Francisco in ruins. Grieving and newly sober, Mark (Kyle Chandler) stalks wolf packs in another part of the world. Emma (Vera Farmiga), his ex-wife, continues to work on the Orca, a machine they created together that can emit soundwaves capable of calming or infuriating Godzilla-scale monsters. Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their precocious daughter, is caught in between - especially when Emma's decision to use the Orca sets off a chain of monstrous events that could lead to the end of the world as we know it.THE GOOD: The concept at the heart of Godzilla II, quite frankly, is off-the-wall wacky - so bold and audacious and weird that you have to give director/co-screenwriter Michael Dougherty some credit for effort, even if his execution of it is somewhat lacklustre. This is no mere story of monsters raining mayhem down upon mankind. Instead, the film moves its mythology quite firmly into the realm of faith; Godzilla, the film suggests, is as much god as monster. It's actually quite remarkable to see a mainstream blockbuster movie embrace - rather than shy away from - religious iconography, folding in theologies and environmental philosophies from Greek myth to Thanos. As such, Godzilla and his arch-nemesis, King Ghidorah (a three-headed Hydra-esque dragon beast), aren't just having their version of a bar-room brawl - their earth-shaking clash is a battle for the survival of humanity.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: It's a shame that the film as a whole can't keep up with its high-concept ideas. The writing ranges from inspired to insipid, with character motivations dancing ridiculously back and forth - dictated mostly by the rather demented plot. As a director, Dougherty exhibited some skill with subversive comedy in cult horror flick Krampus, but very little of that is evident here. It's not just about sacrificing soul for scale - Dougherty occasionally struggles with telling such a massive story in visual terms. Some of the film's action sequences are so choppy as to be downright confusing. It doesn't help that Dougherty's preferred aesthetic tends towards the grey and grim, which makes it even harder to figure out just what is going on while monsters are duking it out in frustratingly murky lighting.THE MONSTER MASH: The first Godzilla film in the franchise suffered for shoving its titular monster into the background, having him play second fiddle to human characters who weren't all that well-written to begin with. Godzilla II tries to rectify that, somewhat, by flinging so many monsters at the screen that you'd be almost glad to get back to the human drama after a while. Apart from Godzilla and Ghidorah, fans will be glad to see old-school Toho favourites like Mothra and Rodan in action too. (If they could actually see them, that is. Seriously - the monsters are beautifully rendered, but the bruise-toned lighting does them no favours.)GOD(ZILLA)-LEVEL CASTING: If Dougherty learned one thing from his predecessor, Gareth Edwards, it's the importance of casting a bunch of top-notch character actors in an otherwise barmy creature feature. Veteran performers like Oscar nominee Farmiga, West Wing alumnus Whitford and Charles Dance (that's Tywin Lannister to you) reel off awkward exposition and pseudo-scientific claptrap (""bio-acoustics"", ""the Oxygen Destroyer"") like it's actual real human dialogue. It's quite remarkable to see Friday Night Lights' Coach Eric Taylor in action anti-hero mode, but Chandler - just as Bryan Cranston did in the 2014 film - brings an everyman weight to a character whose narrative arc is muddled, to say the least. The MVP here, though, is Brown. She brings to Madison the same soulful blend of toughness and tenderness that made her such a breakout star in Netflix's Stranger Things.RECOMMENDED? It depends. Godzilla II is a hot mess... but it's a fascinating hot mess, and surprisingly fun to watch and even think about.","8/10"

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","grantpaulsen","2 June 2019","This was the worst Godzilla movie I've ever seen. This film has the dumbest, stupidest, and illogical human characters I've ever seen in a film, who also take up 80% of the runtime, and because of that it doesn't feel like there was more monster fights than there were in the first one. The writing sucks, the script is worthless, the dialogue is laughably bad, the directing is incomprehensible, the character motives are completely warped, and the monster fights were underwhelming to be honest. On top of that the film is incredibly boring, so that makes it completely unwatchable. This is probably the worst movie I've seen so far this year.","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","nitsua125","30 May 2019","Firstly, I should state that I went into this film with no real expectations of any sort. I found the first movie watchable but not terrible. This sequel however, was awful.Don't get me wrong the effects are good, and there's plenty of action. That's where the positives end. The plot is contrived, messy, and manages to shoehorn in every cliche known to man.(spoilers from hereon in)One thing that really irritated me was the 'climate disaster' subplot, which almost feels like it was put in as an afterthought. If anything it trivialises the issue, which should not just be used as a plot device. The film is bloated, jumps around too much, and would probably have been served better across multiple movies, although I definitely won't be watching further instalments.The acting is bad, you can almost tell everyone agrees it's a poorly written script. From Kyle Chandlers 'reluctant and troubled hero' to Vera Fermiga's 'questionable motives for the greater good'.Even supporting characters get to play with cliches. Ken Watanabe's character decides to sacrifice himself, due to multiple convenient plot holes allowing the protagonists to go and blow up Godzilla's underwater house with a nuke. Charles Dance is good when you see him, but his character disappears without explanation during the third act.Millie Bobby Brown also puts in a good performance, I like her as an actor but her skills are wasted here. Her character manages to run from an outpost to a football stadium in 5 minutes, which then conveniently happens to be right next to her house, somehow miraculously still standing after the giant alien kaiju destroys everything around it.Yeah, it turns out the main antagonist of the movie is an ancient alien that has been frozen for millennia... because why the hell not? By the time that revelation came I was just surprised no one had woken up to find out it was all a terrible dream. I kind of wish it was a dream, then I wouldn't have wasted 2 hours of my life.I've never walked out of a film, but this time I was very close. To conclude, a very strong contender for worst film of 2019.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","hissss1","29 May 2019","This movie gets everything right I wanted it to get right. The story, once again, focusses rather heavily on humans, but this time around Godzilla gets the attention, screen time and level of intimidation he deserves, just like his titan friends. From monster designs to fights, there are more than just a few memorable, extremely well presented moments. And when the Godzilla theme plays and you are allowed to see the king in all his glory, it's actually very touching.The effects are hit or miss on occasion, but for 90% of the time your eyes will be fed with beauty. Sadly, there was rarely a shot which showed all monsters fighting at the same time from an acceptable distance, and pretty much every battle started with the movie instantly going back to humans.
There are a few cringeworthy moments when it comes to dialogue and story, and these make you believe you are watching a movie which in part heavily tries to appeal to children, though that's not necessarily a bad thing since Godzilla's target audience were children for decades. It's quite often a back and forth between a witty 90s movie and a try to move onward.If you are a person who heavily enjoyed the 2014 film, you may have a few problems with this one. The fights are faster and way more chaotic and Godzilla himself can rarely be fully appreciated outside of the scenes solely dedicated to him, thankfully those scenes are outstanding.What fans wanted was more, way more Godzilla, and this is what we got. If you just want to see Godzilla slapping big monsters while everyone around acknowledges his glory, this is exactly the movie for you. None of the negative points I raised truly matter if you can leave the cinema with a smile on your face, because the movie gave you exactly what you asked for. They listened, they genuinely tried and they succeeded and the outcome should be celebrated. It's a great, faithful film about everyone's favorite oversized monster.","6/10"

In this film you can never see any creature clearly,there either obscured by smoke,fire,ice,clouds all water.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ICMooVees","1 July 2019","There is a great challenge to get the size, proportion and perspective of humans, buildings, etc. to fit well within a screen at the same time as giant creatures or robots (Pacific Rim). And I think it is capturing that perspective and realism on the screen that makes such movies a good draw and success. G:KoM does accomplish that very well. And with the latest in CGI it gets better each time. Just like PR, there is so much eye-candy to be enjoyed such as the surface detail of the titans and the related choreography of the combatants. I've watched, I believe, nearly every giant monster movie. And given the budgets, era's of production with the available special FX of the times, quite a few are very enjoyable while some are just laughable junk. While this was a great movie, it did suffer a bit from the human drama distractions and plot lines. Otherwise if your are a fan like me, this is a must-see on the big screen!","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kbrenkb","1 February 2021","Ok so, I'd like to preface this by saying I have absolutely ZERO issues with women in the military, BUT (yes there's always a but), in the case of this film you have a female colonel, who clearly would not be able to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test (and by the way a woman who is wayyyyy too young to be a colonel), who is also taking tactical control in a high threat environment?! I'm sorry but a colonel is not going to be on the ground with her troops, and any colonel who has been deemed worthy of command with an organisation such as the fictional Monarch, is going to be the best of the best of the best - meaning smart as a whip, fearless and physically fit.
Look I don't care that they cast a woman in the role, I just think someone else should've won out on this one.. Thinking maybe Angela Basset? Halle Berry? Jada Pinket-Smith?

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","theshadow1963","3 June 2019","If you've never seen a Godzilla film before, or have only a passing acquaintance with the King of the Monsters, then you can thoroughly enjoy Godzilla: King of the Monsters for its epic action, well crafted internal mythology and tense human drama.
But if you are a fan of Japan's most famous export, if you grew up watching stuntmen in rubber suits battling during Saturday afternoon Creature Features, you owe it to yourself to see this movie ASAP. It is so chock full of Easter eggs, shout outs and references to the 65-year history of Japan's ""kaiju eiga"" franchise, this reviewer lost count before the first hour was up.
The film picks up five years after Godzilla destroyed the MUTOs in San Francisco, leaving the city in ruins (because, let's face, whether he's friend or foe, Godzilla is the patron saint of collateral damage). The world is now aware of the presence of unstoppable giant monsters called ""Titans"" and the debate rages on as to whether destroy them (assuming a method can be found) or accept them as a force of nature and try to adapt to their presence. Monarch, the agency that has been studying the Titans for 40 years, is under pressure from the U.S. government to help find a way to destroy the Titans, and under attack from a paramilitary outfit led by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) who wants to co-opt the Titans for his own purposes.
The central characters are scientists Mark and Emma Russell and their daughter Madison. The Russells' son was killed in the battle between Godzilla and the MUTOs. Now, Mark wants to see all Titans exterminated while Emma wants to understand them, to which end she has created a device that allows rudimentary communication with Titans. Alan kidnaps Emma and Madison to steal the device and release the three-headed Monster Zero (King Ghidorah) which leads to an all-out mass emergence of Titans, with only Godzilla and Mothra willing to defend humanity from extermination.
The monster battles are suitably epic; clearly the makers of this movie heard the complaints from fans that their last Godzilla film didn't have enough Godzilla in it. Godzilla himself is re-imagined, displaying more intelligence and energy than before. And Mothra and Rodan have never looked so badass.
There are some minor snags in the plot. It's never made clear what the relationship is between Monarch and U.S. Army. Monarch has military hardware and personnel at its disposal and autonomous control over them, but there are multiple references to an ongoing conflict between Monarch and the U.S. government, which wants to use Monarch's data to destroy the Titans. Jonah Alan's motivations are never made clear: is he trying to profit from weaponizing Titans or is he a nihilist who wants to trigger a global genocide? Zhang Ziyi playing twins comes completely out of left field (although the revelation that both their mother and materal grandmother also had twins is clever tip of the hat to the Shobajin, the little twin fairies that appear in the Mothra movies). And the movie also has an ongoing issue with depicting action scenes when the human characters and the Titans are on the same stage. The Titans create so much damage, tearing up the landscape and tossing around mountains of debris, the humans often seem to be swallowed up in the swirling mass of CGI effects.
Besides the four Toho monsters, there are numerous other Titans seen in small doses, opening the franchise to multiple more sequels. Strangely, although Kong and Skull Island are mentioned multiple times, neither appears in this movie.
Ken Watanabe is amazing as Dr. Serizawa, now leader of Monarch and the only man who seems to fully understand the big-picture of the Titan presence. His character is there to be Mr. Exposition, but his performance is that of what a Godzilla fan would choose to be if he could enter the film as a character.
The shout-outs to other kaiju movies abound: from the code name of ""Monster Zero"" applied to Ghidorah and his origins, to the use of a weapon called the Oxygen Destroyer, to the sound effects for Rodan's and Mothra's roars being amped-up versions of their original sounds, to the use of the original Godzilla and Mothra musical themes in the soundtrack.
In conclusion, Godzilla, King of the Monsters is magnificent monster epic that may be remembered and the greatest giant monster movie ever.","10/10"

However, as popcorn flicks they are reasonably entertaining. I will say I thought the cast of Godzilla: KOM was far superior to the 2014 Godzilla cast in many ways. Vera Fermiga, Millie Bobby Brown and Kyle Chandler were all excellent in their roles. I wasn't sure this would be the right break out vehicle for Brown from Stranger Things but I think this will do it because she really is great and steals the show in many ways. Ken Watanbe is also very good in a smaller supporting role. The big problem with this genre of film is believability and I know that lots of movies require a suspension of belief but monster films don't address the ""monster"" in the room in that if this were real, no one would ever survive but the heroes always do unless they make a stupid decision not to. The monsters lay waste to each other, the story is decent, the acting is solid and it fits into the Universe it created so it delivers everything it promises to. 7/10","10/10"

No spoilers. Yeah there's some cornball people stuff and plot advancing decisions (have you Seen A Godzilla movie?), lol. But... wow! My son and I were giddy the whole time. Of course, like he said... we're biased. Lol. Big time big G fans and have been all our lives. Obvious love of the genre on hand with the filmmakers. Hero shots and cool reveals for all the big guns.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","willzilla-91448","2 July 2019","I liked this movie but wish we could have been teased a wee bit more with close-ups of the other MINOR kaiju in this good flick(trillion times better than Fraudzilla/Roland Emrich debacle). I can't wait till Godzilla vs King Kong due out in 2020 (HOPEFULLY). Thumbs up from me!","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Reviews_of_the_Dead","30 May 2019","Now anyone who knows me and my film tastes knows that I loved Godzilla films growing up. I tended to watch the same ones over and over again, but I ended up seeking all of them out as an adult. I remember seeing the 1998 remake with my father and sister in the theater. I enjoyed the most recent remake and the talk of this universe they were building. When hearing about this film, I had to see it. I thankfully got to see it early as a surprise showing was happening at my theater. The synopsis is the crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.This film starts off back in 2014. In San Francisco when Godzilla was on a rampage there. Since then, the organization Monarch has been seeking out the large monsters to keep track of and monitor them. Their goal to keep them from waking up, but the military is considering just exterminating them to prevent the loss of human life. I should point out here that it is an interesting nod to all of the names of monsters that have some kind of monarchy associated with them as well.There is a family that is torn apart. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his wife Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) lose their son in 2014 during the attack. This drives them apart with Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their daughter, staying with her mother. The two of them are in China monitoring what turns out to be an egg containing the larva of Mothra. Things take a turn when some ecological terrorist attack, freeing Mothra and the them taking Emma and Madison.She has created a machine that can stop the monsters with a frequency, but it also can make them angry as well. They use this to free what they are calling Monster Zero, who turns out to be King Ghidorah. This draws Godzilla into battle, but the giant lizard cannot defeat him. The military gets involved and makes things much worse. The terrorist also wake up Rodan from his volcano in Mexico. King Ghidorah wakes up the rest of the known kaijus on the planet. There is also a secret about the three headed dragon that Dr. Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) thinks she has discovered.Now I wanted to go a bit more vague than usual here. Most of what I recapped is literally within the first 15 minutes of the film. The rest is really at the end of the first act of the film. Being this film officially hasn't had any official showings as of the time of writing this, I wanted to make sure that if anyone read this, the film wouldn't be ruined for you.The first thing I really should talk about is I think a lot of people aren't going to consider this a horror film. I personally don't blame you. I do think that kaiju films are definitely horror adjacent for me. The thought of giant monsters destroying cities and killing all of the people that they do is pretty horrific. Now this film does have some pretty bleak moments, it is no where near as dark as the original Godzilla film was.These films are quite interesting to me, as I think quite a bit of them are fun while they can also be cheesy. This one does have some cheesy lines by some of the characters, especially Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford). I can really let that slide to be honest. What they really need to do is balance the giant monsters fighting and the humans' story. I think this one does that well.The human story is interesting in this as the reason the terrorist group is doing what they are doing is because humans are ruining the planet and as a race we are pretty much garbage. As bleak as stating this sounds, I am 100% in agreement with this. I really like that aspect, because there is a duality between trying to save us while we destroy the planet or allow natural progression to happen with the monsters doing what they are made to do.Going along this story, I absolutely love the concept of incorporating mythology into the lore of these monsters. There are some really cool images that are used to associate with them that I was a big fan of. As a lover of mythology, this was definitely an aspect that really hit home for me.This film does have some really good fights between the monsters as well. I personally love the realism of how all of these giant creatures look and that really made me happy to see. I will say here that it is definitely CGI heavy, which actually turned out to be just fine for me. It never took me out of it which was surprising. I think that the effects in this film are great to be honest.As I kind of touched on a couple of paragraphs up, the balance of the kaijus and the humans is an interesting balance you need. I think that writer/director Michael Dougherty does an excellent job of that. Now I know him from Trick 'r Treat which was a horror anthology and Krampus, where he had to balance different aspects for each film. I think that experience really shines through. Being this film was just over 2 hours, it didn't feel like and I was on-board the whole way. The ending is even interesting alluding to the next film that is supposed to be coming.Acting for the film I thought was really good as well. There is such an interesting cast with Chandler, Farmiga and Brown as the broken family. They all did great. I was glad to see that they used Ken Watanabe, who is an amazing Japanese actor as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. I thought he was great too. Zhang, Whitford and the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well. I could go on and on here, but I won't.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. I saw that Bear McCreary did it I was excited. I first saw his name for The Walking Dead. What I really like about this film though, he incorporated music from the original film and other ones in the series while also doing his own thing as well. It really fit and definitely helped enhance the scenes.Now with that said, I might be running off the high of the film, but I really did enjoy it. I liked how they incorporated a solid social message into this film while giving us what we really want. This was brought to life by great acting and writing for sure. There was a bit of cheesiness to it, but I come to expect that. I think the editing of the film keeps the balance, keeps it interesting and the ending was solid. It is CGI heavy, but it looked. The soundtrack of the film was also helped to enhance the scenes as well. I would have liked to know more about some of the monsters that I didn't recognize, but if these films keep having the success I think they will, they definitely could later. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing. I thought it was really good.","1/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","rikishiv","4 June 2019","Absolutely loved the movie and plan on seeing it at least one more time. Visuals were amazing and the fights were beyond awesome. As most are saying, the story was not perfect, but I'd say it serves its purpose to fill space between the action sequences. While this movie does have plot and character issues, it doesn't take away from the fact that the fighting scenes are insane and action-packed. Overall, I thought this movie was a great way to kickoff the summer!","5/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","iambabyhuey","1 June 2019","Omg. Finally. A movie where the monsters kicked ass. Acting who cares, story nonsters fighting each other...

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ZestyLimeStudios","6 September 2019","Right before i start i gave this film 10/10 purely for the monster parts, not the human bits of the film which are, well, kinda boring and pointless.So i must say you HAVE got to watch this in iMAX other wise you are missing out, i honestly saw this film 9 times in 2D & 3D iMAX because i knew i would not get the chance again after it left the cinema, oh boy was i amazed at the Cgi, the Cgi is incredible, really well done, the monsters look insane, especially Ghidorah & Mothra, the film filled the entire iMAX screen i was in and the sound was next level, it filled your head and soul with this raw power these monsters were giving off, the sound, the deep beating music, the sheer volume of the monsters crys, honestly its amazing.Now for the bad points, the human parts, which most reviews seem to be saying as well that the human drama parts and kinda boring really, i understand they've got to have some story and not all monsters fighting, but they were just dull and easily forgettable. Although i did love the flying scene when the big plane has to out run Rodan.Just watch this movie with the view that you are going to be watching big ass monsters going ape at each other, appreciate the CGi, appreciate the sound and enjoy the feel it gives you, but please make sure you do watch it on Blu-Ray with a good set of headphones or sound system to appreciate the film to its max.Like i said 10/10 for the monsters, 0/10 for the human drama parts, but i didn't want to lower the score because of the human parts.Age: 25 - Cinema: Stevenage iMAX 2D & 3D

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","irishredheadco","31 August 2019","So many amazing actors relegated to support roles and they give the lead role to an absolute B actor. This guy is the worst of the worst. Not to mention the story stinks so bad I was ready to shut this crap off after 30 minutes but my husband made is finish it as punishment for my bad movie pick.
The only redeeming factor is the monsters themselves. The firebird eats an ejecting fighter pilot which was worth the $6 we paid. So disappointed in this sequel as I loved the first one.","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","amitghattimare","31 May 2019","In the movie we see a family trying to save their daughter but in the process killing millions of people. This doesn't make sense. They're selfish who only want their people to be saved and don't care about anything else. Monster fighting scenes keep the interest but the story only disappoints. Better to be watched at home when you've lots of free time.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","bononista","31 May 2019","There are So Many people including critics that have ZERO knowledge of Toho Canon, so much so that when I see titles like this I know the person writing has absolutely ZERO emotional or intellectual investment in the 30+ films and Godzilla canon. They espcially have no clue what Mothra is about and missed the 11 appearances over the 65 years, espcially missing the Toho films of the 90's only release in Japan. DO YOUR GODZILLA KAIJU RESEARCH BEFORE GOING TO SEE THE FILM AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE REASON WHY MOTHRA, RODAN, GHIDORAH, AND GODZILLA are of massive significance culturally, spiritually, emotionally, and what they represent socio politcally. From Day One Godzilla has been the creation as a statement against the atom bomb, and moving foward he became a statement against nuclear waste, air polution, polution of the ocean, etc. and how what we as humans do to this planet to destroy it. If such creatures existed today, they SHOULD reclaim the planet because we've doomed it. Mothra IS a spirutal being, Rodan at one point was a serogate to a Mothra egg. Ghidorah was originally a space creature that became a protector when Godzilla was 'off'. To say that this film ""fails"" at it's own canon which IS a blend of antcient beliefs of our being responsible for (mother) earth with the political statement about what we've done to harm it and how it tears us apart as a race is idiotic. It NAILS this, finally, in a US film SOLELY BECAUSE THE FILMMAKERS FINALLY CONSULTED TOHO. These characters were created between 1954 and 1961 with Ghidorah showing up in 1964. If you don't know your Godzilla and Kaiji canon don't go see the film until you do your homework. Walking into Godzilla King of the Monster 2019 with nothing in your pocket other than Godzilla 2014 is the same as try to watch Avengers: Infinity War and Avenger: Engame but having seen NONE of the 10 years worth of MCU films to lock in an emotional and intellectual investment. (It's also why people keep commenting on all the things Captain American would or could have seen or done after he stayed in the 40s - TIME DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, he's on a new world line). Start with watching Rodan's solo film, then Gojira 1954, Godzlla vs Mothra (aka The Thing) 1961, Ghidora's two back to back films, etc. Or, shut up.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","gzilla100","28 May 2020","This movies is freaking amazing i really do love this movie . I was so hyped form this movie yes even more excited than freaking endgame to see my four favorite monsters on the big screen . Also we needed a good Godzilla movie after Godzilla the planet eater which sucks and is my least favorite in the entire series . But this is easily my favorite in the godzilla movie in the monster verse series by far. It feel the most epic and huge . Also this movies is more fast paced than the previous movie and the monsters are it a lot more than the previous movie. The characters are good but a step from the characters from the previous movie . The music is freaking amazing they use old tracks from the older movies for godzilla and mothra which sounded so freaking great. Bear McCreary really did excellent job . Unfortunately we don't hear the themes for rodan and ghidorah but sill the music was still amazing . The design of the monsters where great as well . Godzilla is the same as he was in the previous movie but his spikes have changed to look more like the classic spikes and his feet didn't look like elephant feet this time around . Rodan was freaking amazing this is the best rodan (rodan , ghidorah the three headed monster, invasion of Astro monster , destroy all monsters, godzilla vs mechagodzilla 2, godzilla final wars ,and godzilla king of the monsters)we've seen since 1956 . Also i like how he comes out of a volcano and his fire on him . Also the scence were he's chasing the monarch base was really really well done . Mothra (mothra 1961,mothra vs godzilla , ghidorah the three headed monster , EBIRAH horror of the deep , destroy all monsters ,godzilla vs mothra, godzilla vs spacegodzilla , rebirth of mothra ,rebirth of mothra 2.rebirth of mothra 3, GMK, godzilla Tokyo sos,godzilla final wars, godzilla the planet eater ,and godzilla king of the monsters ) looks good , i do like how she looks more realistic than some of her previous design . Unfortunately mothra and rodan aren't in the movie that much was was a little disappointing because the movie focuses more on godzilla and king ghidorah but still it was nice to see them. Finally king ghidorah (ghidorah the three headed monster , invasion of Astro monster, destroy all monsters, godzilla vs gigan , godzilla vs king ghidorah , GMK,godzilla final wars , godzilla the planet eater ,and godzilla king of the monsters )was amazing . This is easily the best versions of the characters in the entire series . He was huge and massive he really felt like a threat in this movie. Also i loved how the heads had personalities. I do like the Easter eggs they have in this movie which you have to be a die hard godzilla fan to get all the references. The final battle was amazing this is the best looking godzilla fight i mean its not my favorite but still freaking amazing . I highly recommend to watch this movie right freaking now","4/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Cinemagoer77","25 July 2019","This is what a Godzilla film can be. He is the title character, a kaiju super animal, similar to how humans have superheros. This film is beautifully done with apocalyptic imagery that cannot be forgotten. This is also, King Ghidorah, Rhodan, Mothra done better than anything ever done on screen. If you have ever watched older Godzilla films before this one blows them all away. Also, for those critics saying there is zero human character development, in defense of this one time movie, the mom had the best story. She suffered tragedy, became deluded, realized she was wrong, decided to help and died for redemption. Her story affected the entire family and humanity. Most stories where someone is responsible for mass deaths, and finds redemption the character must die..like Vader died. Pretty decent writing for a movie about a giant lizard. If you want convoluted story lines, more sub-plots because thats what you will get, watch game of thrones. Considering it is a kaiju movie, this film was written fairly well, with a few dead spots. The radiation exposure in the end would have caused their deaths eventually. That is one of my problems with the film but nothing that could not be corrected later on in further films. This was an epic Godzilla film and the box office did no justice. A film for those who watch kaiju films it is a superior film, better than the 2014 film. Do not believe the negative critics. Think about what a kaiju film really is. It is it's own sub-genre. This one rocks all of them.","8/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","StephenIsADumb","2 June 2019","Absolutely one of THE best monster films you will ever see. Super campy acting at times but it is super lovable. Intense action pretty much non-stop. CGI is top notch and very believable considering how absurd the concept of giant monsters is. Go see this even if you are hesitant, you will NOT be disappointed.","5/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","resrwa","31 May 2019","You get what you expect. A beat-em-up spectacular between massive titans.There are some slow bits which I do feel break the tension and were a bit too frequent, and some cringe-worthy one-liners, so I can't give it a higher score than an 8. But it is still well worth the price of admission.The hint at the larger universe of Godzilla/Monarch (Skull Island is mentioned several times) and the setup for the next sequel were exciting (yes, they are going to do THAT versus movie.) The last picture during the end credits definitely confirms that.Also, there IS a short post-credits scene to let you know what Tywin Lannister is up to now...","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","mochteam","25 September 2019","I've had enough with this Godzilla remakes. This movie has barely anything to do with Godzilla and as a matter of fact most of the time they're fighting in the background while the story follows a boring family around and their drama. The worst part is none of them can act and that girl from Stranger things needs to stick to stranger things.I hate when Hollywood white washes Japanese films. The original Japanese shows always revolved around the monsters and this movie just revolves around the boring actors. I don't get why they can't just give you what you came to see a giant monster movie about giant monsters fighting. This thing is 90% family drama and 10% Monsters.They just took the plot from Godzilla vs. Destroyah and incorporated it into this movie in the worst way. Also why is Mothra so weak when Mothra is one of the hardest monsters to beat even for Godzilla and why is Mothra so tiny when it's bigger than Godzilla? Better yet why is Mothra one of the most recognized monsters in the series just a small role that serves no purpose? This moving is stupid, boring, and excruciatingly long. The monster effects and scenes were actually the best part and only good parts yet the monsters are treated like background extra's like this movie isn't titled Godzilla.A better title for this movie would be Boring White Family featuring cameos by Godzilla,Mothra, Rodan and Ghidorah.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","lambiepie-2","2 June 2019","Yes, I am a Godzilla fan from 4 years old. And yes, this is the type of movie an old time fan has been waiting for. Not just Godzilla, but the top Titans. And in that area, this film did not disappoint. It was beyond amazing seeing these Titans with up to date technology. Godzilla was very much bad to the bone. Mothra, was simply beautiful and tough. Monster Zero/King Ghidarah was the best ever on the screen, very hydra, very serpent. That made this a very good film for me.The Titan who surprised me and I wanted to see more - was Rodan. His first appearance in this film was very frightening. It was so good, I wanted to see Rodan with more screen time. And he would have as Mothra should have as well if..and this was the weaker part of the film...if there wasn't too much on the humans.As a fan, I was there for the Titans, and the fighting of the Titans and Godzilla. He was ""God"" +""Zilla"" and much better than what he was in 2014. this film seemed like a good step up and onward as he was more in his element, but the humans inside that element were...distracting. It seemed like when the film was getting good with the Titans battling, they cut to the human 'family drama' and I got to the point where I didn't care. So, I won't mention them in this review beyond generalizations. Don't get me wrong, there should have been humans in the film, but it should have been an either/or proposition. Either take one human and follow it along, or leave the human stories alone and focus on the military which makes perfect sense in a film where big monsters are destroying themselves and cities. That's the draw. That's the interest and as interesting as these Titans were and their stories, there needed to be more on them, very little on the humans.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","FlashCallahan","11 June 2019","Another addition to the so called 'Monsterverse', and another damp squib of a film, with very impressive effects.At least here, Dougherty sort of goes back to basics with the monster mashes, but they are few and far between, and all the filler is lots of incoherent exposition featuring a wealth of gifted actors who will be bad mouthing this film in the next couple of years.Apart from the titular creature, and some 'remember me from the other film' cameos, this film is a totally different 'beast' from Evans 2014 in carnation.Here we have thespian Charles Dance dressed for Jurassic Park, staring menacingly at people whilst holding a gun to someones head. That's him done in the film, and he's the best thing in it, because it's such a bizarre turn for him, even though he pops up in every turgid fantasy film released lately.Obliviously, Nuclear family is a key component of the narrative, with father trying to find estranged wife and daughter, but it's handles so poorly, you just yearn for a CG beast to blow something up.And when it happens, its impressive, but only if you catch it in on the biggest screen and in 3D, you may as well go all out for the spectacle.But although the Kaiju look like they are fighting in the same world as Fincher's Se7en, you cannot help but feel a little excited when Godzilla finally goes thermonuclear.But my word, it's a slog while the monster mash is absent.When the King and the God finally face off next year, this franchise will be extinct.","9/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ConnorMacleodoftheClanMacleod","31 May 2019","Words cannot express the level of enjoyment I gave just experienced watching this film!I have grown up with the Godzilla franchise, I was first introduced to it during the Christmas of 1996. As one of my gifts I was given a VHS copy of the 1965 version Godzilla vs Ghidorah directed by Ishiro Honda. I fell in love with it then and have never turned back. 1998 Godzilla was fun as a kid but looking back was a bit of a let down and then we had the 2014 Hollywood revival of Godzilla vs The Mutos. A controversial view but I think it started the monsterverse off well! As a young kid watching monsters face off against each other is what it truly all about and it still is as a grown up. Who doesn't love a titan battle??For years I have wanted a film of Godzilla facing off against his arch nemesis and now it's here my god does it wow! From the very get go you are thrown into action and unlike the 2014 version they do not beat around the bush, the dialogue between the fantastically picked cast is engaging and informative, they don't shy away from name dropping other Titans either. It is a monster action masterpiece. It's called Godzilla: King of the Monsters, not Godzilla: King of democracy and peace talks. It does exactly what it says on the tin and does not disappoint! If you don't enjoy theses such films then it's not for you, this wasn't made for awards etc, it was made for enjoyment and that's exactly what it provides!The CGI in this film is perfectly balanced, don't read what the pessimists have to say. Why should we not have the best CGI of monsters battling each other? Why should we not see Godzilla running through Boston to tackle Ghidorah? Why should we not these monsters in all their glory. We have screens with such definition these days for reasons and that is for films to shock and awe. It has always been that way and long may it continue. For critics to come out and say that the film uses to much CGI is just rubbish and evidently written by someone who is stuck in their ways... get with the times!A special mention to Ken Watanabe whom reprises his role as Dr Sewizara and is a true hero of this tale, he encompasses everything about an admirer of Godzilla, he brings acting pedigree that does not overshadow all those on screen.If you love the form of escapism that is cinema then go to see this film.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","freewebstennis","2 June 2019","I enjoyed the movie so much. I was extremely happy that there was lot of fight in the movie unlike the first Godzilla movie which was a true disappointment for its screen time fights. I would like to first say ""damn you"" to critics. They honestly have no brains of why they go to watch a movie. A movie like this is for entertainment not for human drama. Most critics talk about poor human character development. I really don't care about them, all I care is about monsters and I had enjoyed it by far the most among all Godzilla movies. Deserves the best rating among all Godzilla movies.Thank you Legendary 10/10.","10/10"
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ianpuebla-23180","31 May 2019","I've been a Godzilla fan all my life I grew up with these movies what I saw tonight changed my life. It's like America gave Toho 200 million dollars and said ""go make what you know"". The action was mind blowing it felt like a true Godzilla movie. Now for spoilers so unless you haven't watched it yet stop reading and go see it. The Godzilla theme is used in this film that surprised it sounded amazing and was used appropriately. King ghidorah is the main villain obviously. In the old films he is an alien that came to earth to wipe out the planet. In this film he is that an alien that came to earth to wipe out our civilization. There are other monsters in the film but they don't really serve any purpose. There's Kumonga a giant spider, Manda a dragon a wooly mammoth and a MUTO. When king ghidorah is unleashed these monsters bow to him claiming King. Rodan is a wild card at first he's bad serving as King ghidorahs right hand man. Mothra is obviously on Godzilla's side. Godzilla fights king Ghidorah three times in this film!!!! At first Godzilla sents Ghidorah away but the second time Godzilla is defeated but not by Ghidorah by the oxygen Destroyer. Yes this weapon is in the film but only for like 2 minutes it's used to destroy The monsters but fails. Ghidorah survives which brings us to the final battle in Boston. It's godzilla and mothra vs king ghidorah and Rodan. Mothra Stabs Rodan but doesn't kill him. King ghidorah carries Godzilla about 20,000 ft in the air and drops him. Mothra dies protecting Godzilla and her energy is transferred to godzilla making him super powerful. Godzilla absolutely destroys king ghidorah. Ghidorah dies and Godzilla claims the role of king. At the end all the other monsters bow down to godzilla. Now there is a post credit scene. It's not King Kong even though Kong is referenced a lot in the film but doesn't play a role other than a reference. The post credit features the main human villain (Charles dances character) he finds King Ghidorahs corpse and says the line ""I'll take it"" being a Godzilla fan this only means one thing: MECHA KING GHIDORAH!!!!!!!. Overall the film is so much fun and will entertain the crap out of you. For people who aren't into Godzilla you'll enjoy so much that you'll want to know everything there is to godzilla. I'm seeing it at least 3-4 more times.","9/10"
"Venom","ThomDerd","22 October 2018","Venom is about the symbiotic relationship of man and alien, with the latter being the gross one. Funny at times, with a lovely performance from Tom Hardy -if you are a fan of mr Hardy, this is going to be entertaining for you.
First half goes very well in terms of setting the story and the venom universe, second part is more about action and there it has a few flaws but it is still fun and interesting to watch.
It is a cool view on the ""almost anti-hero"" venom/eddie character that kept my attention.
I had a good time watching this in the theaters and i ll definitely have a second view when it comes out in bray or dvd.
So, all in all its def not the best action film of all times or even of 2018...but dont have too high expectations and you will definitely like it.

"Venom","Ch4ndler_B1ng","12 June 2020","This movie is kind of a mixed bag. There are certain elements of it that I think are creative, but by far it is definitely one of the lesser Marvel films. The only thing I disagree with Martin Scorsese about is that ""Marvel movies are like theme park rides"" because there are ones like Endgame, Thor Ragnarok (my personal favourite Marvel movie), Civil War, The Avengers, Infinity War and many others that have a far deeper meaning and much more than just entertainment. Overall, Venom is one of those okay movies that doesn't deserve hate, the scenes where the Venom inside Tom Hardy's character is talking to him are pretty hilarious.73%","7/10"
"Venom","claudio_carvalho","2 December 2018","""Venom"" is a funny and entertaining film based on a Marvel antihero Venom with reasonable storyline, awesome special effects and weak and annoying villain performed by the awful Riz Ahmed. However, Tom Hardy has good performance in the role of the clumsy loser Eddie Brock and Michelle Williams complete the lead cast. This film is also the chance to see Stan Lee in his last cameo. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Venom""","7/10"

"Venom","TheLittleSongbird","17 October 2018","Do have a fondness for superhero films. 'Venom' also had talented people in the cast, Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams have both done great work in their careers, it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting anti-heroes in the superhero universe.Watched 'Venom' with reasonably high expectations and with the willingness, as always, to judge the film for myself and form my own opinion. Was aware that it was not well liked by the critics, but part of me was really hoping to disagree with the thought that could a film with so much potential be worse than it actually looked? Have to agree with those that were left disappointed, while also not finding 'Venom' to be that bad. Am not though going to join in the irritatingly excessive critic bashing from people who really need to start learning the difference between fact and opinion.'Venom' does have good things. It is at its best in the scenes and chemistry between Eddie and Venom, which had fun and tension. It is when Venom arrives on screen too when the film properly starts to generate interest, after too long struggling to invest in the first act. The darker elements of the film are actually quite well done, having a dark grit and creepiness. It looks reasonably good, well designed and shot with slickness and atmosphere.The music has pleasant moments and fits well while there is some exciting action, especially the car chase sequence. Some of the effects are terrific. Tom Hardy is intensely charismatic, with Eddie/Venom being interesting and well contrasted characters, far more believable than Topher Grace in 'Spiderman 3'.However, the rest of the cast don't fare so greatly. Michelle Williams has never had a flatter character than here and is basically wasted in a development-free plot-device role. Riz Ahmed is far too anaemic for the one-dimensional villain that's both cartoonish and insipid. Of the characters, only Eddie and Venom engage and intrigue, the rest are flat. While some of the effects are terrific, others are terrible especially in the latter stages with the biggest offender being the rushed and clumsy climax.It is the script and story where 'Venom' fails most. The script is really clunky, especially with the forced and goofy humour that can be misplaced (Venom's disgust at taking the elevator was the one moment passing as funny) and the villain spouting dialogues and speeches that mean nothing. The less too about the soapy and clich√©-ridden scenes featuring Hardy and Williams the better, they are bland and don't serve much point, and the Life Institute scenes should have had more clarity. Unfortunately, these scenes dominate the first act and makes it feel rather dull and ""taking too long to get going"". The story is tonally disjointed, too many tones that are very variable on their own and don't gel together, and very clunky. This is not a case of the film not trying, to me it came over as trying too hard in catering to everyone and throwing in too many ideas and elements and executing them very variably and too safely. For a story intended to be dark and violent, this seemed rather tame and held back.Summing up, a disappointment but not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox","5/10"
"Venom","kosmasp","2 May 2019","I get it, even the people who may already hit the not helpful button, before reading this. You see my rating and go: ""no way"". And I get it in the sense, that I haven't read the comics as much as many people who were expecting and hoping this would go ""R""-rated. Of course this stretches the boundaries of PG-13, because it is quite violent. But it will never be enough from what I heard from people who know the comics.So if that is something that is dear to your heart, again I get it. If you are just here to enjoy a comic book movie, there is quite a lot to enjoy. Tom Hardy really cherishes in his mania. Enjoy the Mayhem even if there was a sort of better ""inside voice"" movie last year called ""Upgrade"". So yes, if you only watch one of those make it Upgrade. But if you don't mind watching another, watch this too, because it ain't half bad","7/10"
"Venom","declan-98915","3 October 2018","First of all Iv just watched the movie a couple of hours ago and Iv just been reading a few reviews and I must have been watching a different movie to them cause I absolulty loved Venom!I love the relationship between Eddie and Venom, they proper cracked me up with some of the things they said and the whole room was laughing at loads of moments throughout the movie. Coming out of this movie makes me want to have a symbiote latch onto me if it's anything like the film. I loved the movie from end to finish, it was a hilarious, fun filled action ride!My only critic is I would have liked the finale to go on for a little longer but other than that I thought it was brilliant, I deffo reccomend everyone go see it.DONT Listen to other people's reviews, go watch it for yourself then decide if u liked it or not, I loved it!","7/10"
"Venom","SnoopyStyle","27 December 2018","In San Francisco, struggling reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is ordered to do a puff piece on bio-tech mogul Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of Life Foundation. Drake's spacecraft crashed after retrieving symbiotic lifeforms from a comet. Brock gets fired for asking tough questions to Drake and his fianc√©e Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) leaves him. Drake starts experimenting on people. Scientist Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) turns whistle-blower and sneaks Brock into the research facility. There, Brock is exposed to the symbiote Venom.I had reservations about a Venom movie without Spider-Man. I can safely say that this is vastly superior to Spider-Man 3. The interesting aspect is the relationship between Brock and Venom. They really become actual people and I can feel for them. Venom tells Brock that they're both losers. It's a surprising character reveal and one with good potential for future movies. It's a great way to do this version of Venom given the limitations of the rights issue. At first, I was concerned about Hardy but he turns in a compelling performance. I do have an issue Michelle Williams' hair. I can't tell if they deliberately gave her a bad cut or a bad wig. It does work to downgrade her from Hollywood stardom. It does set up Venom to have an ongoing franchise which is its major hurdle.","8/10"
"Venom","krazy-mm","3 October 2018","Had a test screening tonight in cinema I work at, and couldn't wait to watch my all-time favorite Marvel (anti) hero on big screen.
Tom Hardy is great as always, that guy really can act. Can't think of anyone else who would be a better choice for the role but him.
Introduction was really long, but I was not bored for a second. When Venom comes in his true form - the party starts! Wish few action scenes were less like Michael Bay's style (hardly see anything) but the inner child in me was really happy for Venom's maniacal kicking and punching around. Venom's character is really well made visually - his walking, jumping and smashing are just like in the comic books - thumbs up for that!Hope they will release R rated version on BluRay so we can see more of Venom's craziness. Tom Hardy allegedly said best parts are cut out to make the movie more age appropriate, and I think that's a shame. Anyway, I will watch this movie once more in cinema, and buy it on BluRay. After all, it's Venom!Go and see it on big screen - hope you won't be disappointed!Oh, and there are TWO mid-credit scenes - one we all are waiting for and another one that...just go and see it for yourself!","8/10"
"Venom","akdjreview","21 December 2021","Venom is a nice enjoyable superhero film which I was quite interested in. The film has a very Marvel story, it's not the first time I've seen a story like this one but with just different characters and different settings. Though the story of not knowing whether Venom is good or evil is an interesting aspect not really seen before.But I still found it quite enjoyable. There is no fantastic cinematography techniques or anything like that. But Venom played by Tom Hardy manages to deliver an amazing acting performance in comparison to other Marvel movies.I recommend Venom for superhero film fans to watch it's an interesting story with a little bit of a twist.","7/10"
"Venom","Top_Dawg_Critic","29 November 2018","You would think one of the 5 (why?) writers could have gotten this right. Tom Hardy was amazing, the directing excellent, cinematography on point, V/SFX not bad, but the story was very loose and had plot and pacing issues. Venom's voice was also annoying. You would think the producers would have hired better writers instead of pathetically paying for almost every review on here 9 and above being fake (pretty much only film reviewed). I may have given this film a 7 or 8 out of 10, but only gets a 6 for the fake reviews. For me it could have been much better and deserving of the 9's and 10's had the writing been tighter. Nevertheless, still enjoyable, but sadly only a 6/10 from me, mainly for the fake reviews that piss me off.","6/10"

"Venom","Anurag-Shetty","5 October 2018","Venom tells the story of news reporter, Eddie Brock(Tom Hardy). When a symbiote bonds with Eddie, he transforms into the deadly symbiote known as, Venom. Eddie will have to channel the powers of the symbiote, to save his life. Venom is an awesome film. Director Ruben Fleischer has done complete justice to the character of Venom after his disappointing portrayal in Spider-Man 3(2007). Still, we definitely miss that connection to Spider-Man because, Venom & Spider-Man are always connected in the comics. The action set pieces are fantastic. The critics can't whine about CGI fight scenes because, what more can you expect from a CGI character. Still, I wish they would have shown us some of the more nasty things that Venom did in the movie. An R rating would have helped but, I can understand why they decided to make the movie PG-13. They needed to make way for Spider-Man in possible sequels(fingers crossed). Tom Hardy is the star of the show as Eddie Brock/Venom. Hardy perfects the relationship between Eddie & Venom. Eddie being the vulnerable host & Venom being the caged animal that can be let loose at any time. There are a number of hysterical set pieces involving interactions between Eddie & Venom. Tom Hardy also perfects Venom's classic deep & gruff voice. Michelle Williams is brilliant as Anne Weying. It's nice to see Williams star in a comic book movie. Riz Ahmed is spectacular as Carlton Drake/Riot. Scott Haze is impressive as Security Chief Roland Treece. Reid Scott is great as Dr. Dan Lewis. Jenny Slate is amazing as Dr. Dora Skirth. The supporting cast is impressive. Venom is a must watch for Venom & Tom Hardy fans. Ignore the critics & go for it with moderate expectations.","8/10"
"Venom","Watcher42","25 November 2018","What an incredibly average film.It takes no risks. It's watered down. It's generic. It's trying to give the impression it's following Deadpool down the R-Rated super hero route, but it didn't have the guts to go the whole way, or even take a step really.Tom Hardy is an OK Eddie Brock, but I still find him a bit hit and miss as an actor, and that comes through even from scene to scene here. Sometimes he just mumbles his way through with no effort and I genuinely wondered if he was channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, while other times he actually seemed to be trying, especially with the physical aspects. There's no connection or chemistry between Tom and Michelle Williams. I guess she was just hoping for some Marvel money and didn't realise this was a Sony picture. And the rest of the cast are incredibly average and forgettable. Especially Jenny Slate, who will always be stuck as Mona-Lisa from Parks & Rec.There's years of comic book lore and stories to draw on for Venom, but they ignore much of it... For example, why does Venom look like Spider-man? We know why from the comics, but in the movie it makes no mention of this, so we're left with questions and a very one dimensional character as a result.Of all the stories that could have been told about a symbiotic alien, and all the interesting directions they could have taken the story, they decide to go with what boils down to a boring buddy movie.","4/10"
"Venom","TheMovieDoctorful","5 October 2018","Wow...Something different...Something ACTUALLY different. No, Venom is no masterpiece. It's not perfect. It's not quite as great as I hoped it would be, but...It's ACTUALLY something different. And in an age where Marvel and DC give us the same comic book movie 500 times a year, that's incredibly high praise. Let me clarify; despite what you've been told, Venom is not a superhero movie. Venom is, at its heart, a horror comedy monster flick. It has much more in common in its characters, story, tone, comedy and action sequences with An American Werewolf in London or Evil Dead than, say, The Avengers or The Dark Knight. That's a wildly inventive and different take on the genre and enough to give it some much needed, genuine diversity.As I said, the film definitely has its problems. Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake is a terrible villain, one of the worst in recent comic book movie history. I'd like to say that he's better than most of the easily disposable MCU villains, but even compared to them, he's still low tier. Drake is your typical ""evil corporate bad guy"", but Ahmed is neither charismatic, over-the-top or intimidating enough to make it really work. The real shame is that the movie easily could have made him work as a perfect adversary for Hardy's Brock; a legally invulnerable, corrupt millionaire going up against an unlucky, lower class reporter with a chip on his shoulder. However, this dynamic is never really explored as much as it should be and, by the end of the day, his arc just ends in yet another case of 2 black CGI monsters smashing into each other.The neutered PG-13 rating also hurts the film significantly. To its credit, the film is surprisingly violent (To the point where my theater occasionally gasped) and there are moments of genuine suspense and terror here. However, at the end of the day, this is still the kind of movie where someone can get sliced in half with a blade arm and not leave a drop of blood. The edits are clear and blatant and I couldn't help but occasionally cringe at the obvious censor job Sony did to get the film at a more marketable PG-13. Here's hoping for an R-rated Director's Cut.I must say, Tom Hardy is perfect, as both Eddie Brock and Venom. As Eddie Brock, he's likable, goofy, charmingly dorky and incredibly sympathetic. As Venom, he's darkly hilarious, witty and commands an incredible screen presence. And his chemistry with Michelle Williams' Anne Weying (As both Venom and Eddie Brock) is off the charts. As somebody who frequently finds love stories in comic book films to be tepid and half hearted, this may be my favorite romance in a comic book film. It has its frequent adorable and sweet moments, but it isn't afraid to cover the more painful and stressful parts of their relationship either. It felt way more genuine to me than any other love story I've seen in a superhero movie. There's a scene in the 3rd act of the film involving Eddie, Michelle and the symbiote that is simultaneously sweepingly romantic, absolutely hilarious and incredibly bizarre. Without spoiling it, all I can say is that whether you love it or hate it, you won't forget that moment any time soon.Michelle Williams is fantastic in her own right too. She does an excellent job portraying Weying's spunk, confidence and intelligence and Williams brings both charisma and emotional vulnerability to the role. Weying herself is a surprisingly strong character as well; she's arguably even more proactive than Eddie is and I loved watching her arc from distant and condescending to more empathetic and compassionate. I've missed the days when love interests in comic book movies had genuine character arcs, so Williams' Weying was another breath of fresh air in a comic book movie already full of them.The comedy is definitely the highlight. This is by far the funniest comic book film I've seen to date, it puts both Deadpool movies to shame. It's very reminiscent of a John Landis or Sam Raimi horror comedy from the 80s. Complete insanity in the best way. There's a particular scene in a restaurant that had me laughing so hard my lungs hurt.As for the story, again, it's not particularly deep, but its clever in its own way, and has its admitted emotional moments regarding Anne and Eddie's relationship. The film works as a very interesting anti-Spider-Man movie; Eddie's irresponsibility is as essential to the character as Peter's responsibility and the movie tells a very compelling journey of a deeply self absorbed man having to learn to finally put the people around him above his own self interests when the chips are down. Even Eddie's relationship with his suit serves as a dark mirror to Spider-Man; in Homecoming, Peter has to learn that he doesn't need the suit to be a hero. In Venom, Eddie needs the friendship of his own suit to save the day.Venom is not the best comic book movie ever. It's not quite as great as I had hoped. But it's the farthest thing from bad. It has more heart and brains than critics are giving it credit for and it's a desperately needed original take on a genre that's admittedly been suffering from repetition, exhaustion and over-saturation. It's definitely more interesting, bold and rewatchable than 80% of the easily disposable and forgettable MCU films. It'll probably be more interesting, bold and rewatchable than any of the DCEU films post-Justice League (Including Justice League), which may as well be MCU-lite. I think I'm gonna go watch it again.(Also, very minor point, but that Eminem song was awful. It felt like a Vanilla Ice or MC Hammer song, only unironic and played completely straight. It was actually lowkey embarrassing to listen to.)","9/10"
"Venom","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","5 October 2018","I knew it. The film was not even half as bad as the critics said. VENOM is the electrifying action movie you need to see in theaters. I saw it today in 4DX 3D and found it highly entertaining. There are a lot of white knuckle action scenes enhanced further by a solid CGI work. An exhilarating vehicular chase sequence had me excited to the core and so did all the other action sequences. Tom Hardy's performance is impressive. His interactions with Venom are heart winning. VENOM is ultimately fast paced. I didn't realize when time flew by. This film has made me like Venom a lot. I liked him in SPIDER-MAN 3 also (which was a great movie in my opinion) but he wasn't portrayed as a hero in that one. In this one, Venom will definitely not be hated. There is also a good amount of comedy and horror present in the film although primarily this is an action movie with a science fiction setting.VENOM definitely reminded me of the dark atmosphere built by Sam Raimi in his Spider-Man movies. That's another reason why I wanted to watch it. It's a highly entertaining action entertainer which needs to be seen and enjoyed as a whole. Since this is anyways an origin story, don't expect it to be overstuffed. Just book your tickets, grab some eatables, bring along a friend or be alone, and watch this film on the biggest screen possible, in 3D. Plus, there are some interesting surprises towards the end, so feel free to stay instead of just walking away. P.S. - I have not read any Venom comics till date.","10/10"
"Venom","tresm87","7 October 2018","While it may break away from the comics slightly by not including the Spiderman origin story, the true characterization integrity within Eddie Brock/Venom is vibrant and extremely close to source material. The story alteration might even improve the overall direction of this new standalone Venom series because now we can truly focus on Brock/venom and not have Parker/Spiderman constantly take away from his attention. I believe we've had enough of Spiderman, and honestly after the travesty that was Homecoming imho, I'm fine with that for now. Venom starts off with a bang and we get some nice new aspects to how the symbiotes came to be in this earth as well as some great character development of Eddie Brock's life before Venom. Let me just say that Tom Hardy Makes this entire film work with a completely passionately versatile performance showing immense acting talent like he always does. Once Eddie Brock achieves full symbiosis, it becomes an absolutely intense and fun experience to witness, and it really brought me back to the old comics. I've been a fan of venom for nearly 30 years and I can honestly say they nailed the relationship between Brock and venom, and it's damn right awesome to see it on the big screen. The action never lets up after that and there were some insanely well done sequences full of amazing visuals. I honestly thought the CGI use for venom looked spectacular, and about as good as you could have it. The unexpected X factor of this film was it's hilariously twisted dialogue between Brock and venom, and honestly at times it was almost charming in a way. While there were a few bits that were absolutely ridiculous, I was able to overlook those few and far between moments. I thought Riz Ahmed what is a serviceable enough Carlton drake/riot, and played the conniving billionaire villain decently. I do think the plot was a bit rushed towards the end, but the finale was very exciting regardless. The post credit scene leaves you with an incredible sense of anticipation for the next venom installment as it introduces one of the most violent and brutal characters in all of comics. I did however think he was going to be in this film a lot more and was slightly disappointed ,but when I know what the future holds, I can forget about that slight nitpick. Another huge aspect of this film that breaks away from the safe MCU formula, is its sheer visceral brutality minus any blood really. They actually did a great job on a PG-13 rating making it still a very dark and violent film with some outstanding body horror sequences. I do really hope that they will go for an R rating for the sequel once carnage starts wreaking pure havoc. They would benefit so much from making it R rated. Overall an excellent origin tale,and a surprisingly funny film that deserves a ton of credit for going against the grain and breaking out of MCU formulas to start its own Venom universe. This is not part of the MCU and it's better off for it. I cannot wait for the next film to see Harrelson bring the CARNAGE!","9/10"
"Venom","kevinxirau","12 October 2018","Being that it's October, the month of monsters, there couldn't have been a more appropriate superhero to come out than Venom. Easily one of the most popular Spider-man characters, he made his big screen debut in 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"", which not only failed to impress audiences, but proved to be a great disservice to Venom. Luckily, Sony makes up for this grave mistake with this new film. Plot: Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a journalist digging into the dirty secrets of the shady corporation, the Life Foundation, where he becomes an unwilling host to an alien Symbiote brought to Earth by a rocket ship. As the unlikely pair of man and ravenous parasite endeavors to find a compromise, they must become one as Venom to both survive and prevent more symbiotes from making Earth their new home. Right off the bat, they got Venom right; the internal struggle, the design, and the twisted sense of humor. Hardy gives a well-acted performance as both Eddie and the Symbiote, the two halves bouncing back and forth in a terrific fashion. They alone sell this flick. The supporting cast holds up too with Michelle Williams as Anne Weying doing a good job playing the love interest with a believable relationship. The nods to previous media are also welcome with the mid-credit scene making me geek out. One word best describes the action: savage. The movie works around its PG-13 rating with some satisfyingly kickass fight scenes that get away with nasty-looking deaths (would've preferred rated R, but it works nonetheless). ""Venom"" starts a little slow, getting you into the cast and story organically, but once the titular anti-hero comes out to play, things become seriously fun. An issue that didn't really ruin it for me was that the climax has Venom battling a similarly colored villain (Riot) in a night setting, which made it tricky to see what was going on at times (a differently colored nemesis would've fixed this). The music fits the film as well, having a cool edgy, pseudo-horror vibe to it. All in all, ""Venom"" is a killer good time. Future films are already planned, so I look forward to seeing the toothy alien freak in action once more.","7/10"

"Venom","ThomasDrufke","17 October 2018","So here's the thing, there isn't a single part of this movie that I liked. I can see where some people found it to be stupid entertainment and silly fun, but that's not exactly the way I like movies. There are always exceptions, but with a cast like Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Woody Harrelson (sort of), I expect a lot more. The script for this film is by far one of the worst things put to film over the last few years. I flat out laughed out loud at how bad some of these lines were. And by no means did I think most of this humor was intentional. If you watch any of the trailers for the film, they are pitching a serious & dark take on the Venom character, so don't give me the whole ""it's supposed to bad"" take. That's just not true. You can forget ever seeing Spider-Man show up in these movies, at least if Sony/Marvel wants me to take him seriously at all. There's no sense in going through and ripping apart each and every part of this film, just know that I disliked the entire thing. Nope, I take that back, I hated it.1.7/10","1/10"
"Venom","Pjtaylor-96-138044","3 October 2018","'Venom (2018)' is usually just fine, but it never comes close to being properly engaging or even all that entertaining. It just constantly skirts the line between being pretty decent and just downright boring. This - combined with its overall weak, poorly paced narrative and its general technical choppiness (including noticeably 'jumpy' editing and several scenes that are strangely blurry, to the point that it seems like the focus-puller might've been asleep) - means that the overall experience isn't all that good. The film certainly lands with a whimper rather than a roar. It actually takes ages for Brock to become the eponymous big boy and, when he does, the dynamic between him and his newfound companion never comes close to being fully formed or even consistent. This means that we can't really relate to - or care for - either of them and that their motivations don't really make all that much sense. Their relationship is supposed to be the driving force of the story, yet it doesn't naturally evolve and never comes close to being compelling. To make matters worse, the whole thing culminates in an awful, CG mess of a finale that's literally difficult to watch, much less comprehend. It inexplicably goes back on several core conceits simply to have our symbiotic lead emerge as a more 'traditional' hero, despite the piece being billed as a decidedly 'villainous' affair. The feature is pretty tame in general, to be honest. It all just comes across as more of poor man's 'Upgrade (2018)' than anything else. Don't even get me started on the absolute joke of an end-credits scene. 4/10.","4/10"
"Venom","MichaelNontonMulu","4 October 2018","Movie was slow in the first half hour and only became exciting after Eddie and Venom became one. Special effects were quite awesome, some of the fight scenes (chasing sequence and climax fight scenes) were amazing. The interaction between Eddie and Venom were quite funny at times.I also felt the movie was too short, having less than 2 hours duration which include the long end credit scenes. Btw, it has 1 mid end credit scene which I think could only be appreciated by the fans of the comic books and 1 post end credit scene. So be sure not too leave your seats too soon.The sound effects with Dolby Atmos was awesome and it is also specialized for IMAX theaters. Overall it was quite fun and entertaining movie.

"Venom","pinkled5","5 October 2018","I'm a self-proclaimed movie snob so, based on the reviews I'd read, I fully expected to be disappointed by this film. But my son really wanted to see it, so we went and, wow, I ended up really enjoying it!Yes, there is some awkward dialogue and the villain is underwhelming, however, I liked the other elements so much that those issues really didn't bother me.First off, Eddie Brock is super likable and relatable. Tom Hardy, who I've never been a fan of, knocked it out of the park with his performance of this character. I really felt for Eddie and was drawn into his plight. Though some have complained the beginning of the movie is too slow, Eddie Brock kept my interest the whole time.Secondly, everything about Venom is super cool. The struggle between Eddie and Venom and their argumentative banter made for both some delightful conflict and laugh-out-loud comedy. Yes, there were a few lines that were duds and made me roll my eyes, but overall I thought it was fantastic.Finally, the mix of action, horror, and comedy was done almost perfectly, in my opinion. This was a concern of mine, based on the reviews, but the flim makers pulled it off well.All in all, we left the theater excited and thrilled and can't wait to see Venom on the big screen again. Kudos to Sony and BOOOO to the critics!","8/10"
"Venom","quincytheodore","3 October 2018","Spider-Man has been a personal favorite super hero of mine. Despite the debacle with different studios and without having Spider-Man, I personally rooted Venom to succeed. However, the jarring tonal shift, occasional clumsy dialogues and heavy reliance on CGI are eerie reminisces of less sophisticated super hero movie from early 2000. It's disappointing because there are some good set pieces here and Tom Hardy tries his damn hardest.On a quick glance Venom can be an action thriller, the tone fits perfectly almost in Daredevil crime drama fashion. It almost reaches such darker place but doesn't dare to take the final step, instead it instantly switches to humor. While this new more cynical Venom is not entirely bad, he is such a good character to establish a more intense atmosphere. It does hurt the nuance, toning down on the menacing aura.Whatever element works on Venom can be credited to Tom Hardy. He displays the reluctant anti-hero so dysfunctionally well. His gesture, slight twitch and banter with the alien invader are a blast. Pacing and script can be problematic, but Tom Hardy just goes all in with sheer tenacity. When it goes to Venom, CGI is inevitable. It's rather unconvincing at times and a more physical choreography would do more wonder than the black suit. I want to see this as standalone movie, but in the end Venom does need Spider-Man. He could've been a stronger faster version of Spidey and with Tom Hardy as anti hero, that would've made such an interesting clash. Also, if it wants to go for sci-fi thriller route, there's already a recent movie with same premise, Upgrade, which sadly did everything better.It's not devoid of entertainment, sometimes the humor hits sweet spot, but if you're here for the sentiment of the Venom namesake, this is not the Homecoming you want. It might not be even the Andrew Garfield kind.","6/10"
"Venom","thisseatofmars","5 October 2018","""Venom"" is the best superhero movie I've seen in a long time, partly because it turns the superhero formula on its head. While good, I find The Dark Knight movies usually too intense and serious, while most Marvel movies are too tongue-in-cheek (like constant little jokes Marvel movies inject to mollify a scene's tension). It's interesting then that this film, about a character who looks like a demon from Hell, manages to strike that perfect balance between being dark, intense, and light humour. And make no mistake, Venom is a real monster. He eats the brains of his foes and his voice could make the Predator wet himself. But it's not all dark and intense: Venom is *likeable.* He doesn't make quips; he's earnest. If Venom isn't telling the hero to eat the brains of villains he is egging the hero on to get back with his ex-girlfriend. That is *genius,* and this interest that Venom has in people leads to some fantastic moments in the movie. There's a scene where Venom convinces the hero to apologize to the ex, and the hero does so, ending resentment between the two. When this happens Venom says, completely unironically, ""Aw. That's nice."" I love Venom, the character, and watching him interact with the people around him is just as entertaining as the insane fight scenes where he is decimating whole teams of armoured, armed men. Venom is charismatic and fascinating; I'd love to see more of him interacting with Eddie Brock (the film's protagonist character) and seeing the conversations they'd have. I have to commend the filmmakers on Venom's design: he is huge and brutal and he animates beautifully, from the saliva dripping from his lizard tongue to his creepy, bulbous eyes. Venom should always have that insane, rictus grin on his face; I never like seeing Venom in the comics without it. Having Venom wearing the grin throughout the movie was definitely the right way to go. Tom Hardy is a great actor and his talent delivers the human element of the movie. He's played Bane in Batman and Max in Mad Max; he demonstrates range by playing humorous scenes and the fish out of water character of Eddie Brock, who is utterly bewildered by becoming the host to Venom. Michelle Williams is great as Brock's ex; she is spunky and tough and Hardy and Williams work well together. But Venom steals the show. Brock and Venom have more chemistry than Brock and the love interest. The opening of the film is somewhat slow, but they have a lot to set up. The post-credits scene features Brock meeting Cletus Cassidy, and Woody Harrelson is the most perfect choice to play the role, but the wig they gave Harrelson was ridiculous. But apart from that, I loved ""Venom,"" and I can't wait to see more. Hopefully it won't be too long before we get a sequel.","10/10"

"Venom","FlickChick82","12 October 2018","Tom Hardy rocks! I've been admiring his talent for many years and with this film he has confirmed how versatile of an actor he is. The story is compelling, helped by his incredible performance, moreover, combining it with humour, brings that extra touch. One thing's for sure, you don't want to find yourself on Venom's list. All in all, this movie guarantees a good time at the cinema.","10/10"
"Venom","abisio","6 October 2018","Yes; it is a MARVEL character but the movie was made by SONY which guarantees better action no so intricate (and boring ) script and more adult fare than almost childish scripts in the recent Avengers (forgive me Guardian of the Galaxy).VENOM story is quite simple; looser lost everything, gets possessed by an Alien Parasite and saves the world. Between the lines; the movie leaves a space open for your choice of dark, darker or darkest. VENOM itself eats people alive and on top of that is pretty much killing the host (an outstanding Tom Hardy) so it is not really a very nice guy.The action scenes are original, tense and entertaining; something MARVEL / DISNEY could care less as seen in their last movies. There are lots of humor; sometimes towards to adults and language is strong (even a couple of F** out there).The only two minor problems; it takes perhaps a few minutes to more than necessary to turn on full motion and the script could have been a little more.In brief; pure satisfying and guilty entertainment","9/10"
"Venom","cliff_bd","20 October 2018","I loved VenomThe movie did start a little slow but then it had to build the back story and I still thought this was good.....but when the movie kicked into action it was roller coaster of action and fun.... there had been a number of movies of the years where the character hears a voice in his head. Not many of these type of movies appealed to me... but Venom pulled it off and it added to the humour.Could it have been darker? Yes of course...... but this is Hollywood for you!! What do you expect!I hope the sequels don't disappoint","10/10"
"Venom","AdrenalinDragon","3 October 2018","Believe it or not, I had hopes that Venom might have been good. Not great, just good. Those expectations fell not too far into the movie, before Venom even showed up. The jokes were falling flat, everyone was getting frustrated with Eddie (Tom Hardy) being quite irritating, and nothing much entertaining was happening on-screen. We were all waiting for Venom to actually appear.It wasn't all doom and gloom though. Once Venom finally shows up, it gets a bit better. For example, when Eddie and Venom are actually bantering and telling each other off, it can be entertaining in parts and showed some potential with Venom's character. Definitely the closest anyone got to laughing in my fully packed cinema. That's another problem with the movie, though. It's quite hard to tell what's supposed to be funny and what isn't sometimes. It really is all over the place. I don't know who thought toning it down to PG-13 violence was a great idea. It was disappointing they cut so much content out of the movie.Most of the performances were average. The CGI was not that great. Felt a bit dated and Venom didn't look that convincing for the most part. The soundtrack was passable, I suppose. Nothing really memorable. Most of the movie was mediocre/passable. As I said before, the highlights are when both Eddie and Venom are the focus together, but when it turns to the other characters it becomes a bit dull again. The action sequences range from mediocre to passable, but nothing really stands out as memorable and stuff you haven't already seen loads of times before in superhero movies. You can predict most of the plot and the twist and turns from a mile away. The villain was generic and not all that exciting. I'd suggest sitting through the post-credits sequence though. Overall I don't feel Venom was completely unwatchable, but could have been alot better. Adding Spider-Man to the mix would have probably elevated it quite a bit alone. Overall the negatives/blandness of Venom prevent it from being a good movie. I'm still unsure if I'd like to see a sequel to it in the near future.5/10","5/10"
"Venom","Platypuschow","6 December 2018","When I heard about a Venom movie, I was excited.
When I heard Hardy was to play Brock, I was concerned.
When I saw the trailer, I lost all interest.But truth be told, it wasn't as bad as feared but it certainly isn't everything it should have been.With a heavily modified version of Venoms origin story this R rated movie separate from the Marvel Universe is a watchable but ultimately uninspired affair.When I first heard about the film it was said to not only be R-Rated but delving into the realms of horror. Truth be told the end product is not horror, it's comedy. The idea of Venom being a comedy is insane, yet is the only reason I rated the film as highly as I have.It's actually quite funny and instead of the badass in the comics Eddie Brock is a loveable loser type that Hardy played considerably well.A major cgi-fest this 100 million costing Hollywood effort is saved by the humour it simply shouldn't have even had.The story is generic, it really has nothing very original to offer but a fair few laughs make it more watchable than by all rights it should have been.Venom is better than I expected.
Hardy is better than I expected.
But it's certainly not the Venom movie we wanted nor deserve.The Good:Some great action sequencesQuite funny, oddlyThe Bad:Tom HardyAnother ""Tweaked"" origin storySome of the sfx are actually quite badThings I Learnt From This Movie:I don't remember Eddie Brock being a comedy characterTom Hardy isn't entirely uselessJenny Slate > Michelle Williams","6/10"
"Venom","ayoreinf","8 October 2018","Once again I break my own rule of not writing review for films with over 500 reviews (that is, over 500 when I write my review). I liked this movie because it dares doing a few unthinkable things for a Hollywood action film. It dares showing, in a manner of speaking some collateral damage. I mean - in so many Hollywood action films bullets are flying all over the place in the busiest streets without a single bystander getting a scratch. In this movie they do get hurt, most of the time we see it off screen, but we see it, the movie acknowledge the fact the innocent lives are lost. For a comics based movie, thats as close to realism as they can (and should) get. 
 Another place where the movie is possitively daring, is in daring to show Venum as the character he was created on the comics, a savage predator, with very little noble emotions or caring thought for anyone other than its own self preservation. The movie does veer off the original comic book story of origin, but it keeps the comics book nature of the beast, and that's a big plus in my personal book.Other aspects of movie making: let's not speak about CGI anymore, I think it's a mere technical issue, and there'll always be those who say the CGI was lame. It wasn't but it's not a surprise, it's the way it is. The actors are very good, and I liked the fact Tom Hardy gets to play a comic character with his own face. I hated his mask when he was Bane. It was part of the character, but it killed half the potential of real acting in that film. Here he gets to really act, and he's great. Michelle Williams is as charming as ever, and perfect for the role, and Riz Ahmed is a very good villain. Jenny Slate should get more screen time, she's a great sctress, who doesn't get half the credit she deserves.Altogether, a great, slightly different sort of comic movie, if it wasn't a bit rushed with the convertion of Venum, I'd rate it even higher.","8/10"

"Venom","ellimic","20 October 2018","I saw Venom at the cinema today and thought it was a brilliant film; it had a good plot that turned a disliked Marvel villain into almost an anti-hero, and there were some good funny moments.The idea that Riot and Venom were only two of the four 'samples' returned to Earth, and that Riot revealed there were hundreds more like them on his world, hinted at the numerous Symbiotes in the Marvel comic books.It was a good twist to the story that Anne Weying allowed Venom to bond with her when Venom is separated from Eddie, transforming her into She-Venom, another Marvel comic book character.I hope theres a sequel in the future, which they did hint at with the appearance of Cletus Kasady (who in the Marvel Comic books is host to the Symbiote Carnage).I enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe but knew this was not considered part of that big collaboration (which was confirmed in the opening credits which had Marvels usual logo, not the new logo used in the latest MCU films with scenes from the previous films)
That said I think it would be worthy of the MCU, and being based in San Francisco when the MCU is primarily in New York it would not affect the MCU's storyline, but it could be a good future opponent for Spider-Man.There was a rumour before the films release of an appearance by Tom Holland (the MCU's Spider-Man) but after his 'destruction' at the end of Avengers Infinity War this would have just been too confusing so I'm glad it never happened.","10/10"

"Venom","Prismark10","1 December 2018","Venom was a mess. Not helped that the Marvel character has to be painted as an anti-hero of a sorts and not a villain.Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a committed investigative reporter in San Francisco. He has a nice apartment, an ace lawyer girlfriend (Michelle Williams.)Eddie loses it all when he has to interview an Elon Musk type businessman Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) whose spacecraft crashed. Eddie asks uncomfortable questions regarding his pharmaceutical business and gets fired.Drake has found an organism from space. Drake is conducting unethical experiments with homeless people. The organism achieves symbiosis with Eddie when he breaks into the laboratory and this gives him extraordinary powers and a desire to eat human heads.Eddie and Venom combine, but Eddie is slowly being killed by the symbiote and Venom wants to destroy the planet. Venom has a change of heart and then another more powerful symbiote is unleashed.The film is slow to get going. Hardy looks miscast but gamely tries hard with what he has. Riz is saddled as a onenote villain. Williams is just the bland girlfriend.The film fits uneasily in the Spiderman universe as it is presented as a darker film but totally it is all over the place. With so many script writers, I think this film shows all the signs of post production executive interference.","4/10"

You're constantly fighting the urge to look at the TV and yell ""That's not how it happened!""I don't think Eddie was as much of a scumbag as he should have been...but Hardy was far better than Grace. And they symbiote wasn't exactly as fun as it was in the comics...but then you only really heard one side of the conversation in the comics.For an origin story, it was fun...but with Venom being one of the best known Spidey characters, and with Spidey being one of the best known comic book characters...was an origin story necessary? Especially one that was going to change so much of the character?It could have easily started off after the origin and rolled along on its way as to not irk the fans of the comics.Despite all of that, it was a well balanced mix of amusing and dark, and those combinations usually tend to work...even if it didn't have the blood that gore that would have sent the film over the top in best possible way.You get your money's worth watching it.

Though it did linger on for a tad bit too long.-The plot while amusing, is definitely lacking and drops the ball at least at a certain point, which i cant really dive into here due to spoilers. This certainly is the biggest problem with the movie. -CGI. Not great but certainly far from bad! -Venom. The symbiote is awesome and i loved the bonding with Tom Hardy's character which truly moved the movie forward. Definitely the strongest point within the movie and was eager for more!-Overall. Ignore the damn paid critics. They are a dying breed and shouldve been put out of their misery years ago. This movie is entertaining.

"Venom","Xamalion","3 October 2018","If you read about the difficult way to this movie (it's been in production hell since Spiderman 3), then you have to accomplish that it turned out quite well. Tom Hardy is a really good choice for the role, and he delivers a solid performance as the underdog on his way to become the hero. I really like that they portray him half of the movie as a coward, because when you look at him he's quite an impressive figure. He's likable. I constantly felt the need of hugging him and telliing him ""it's gonna be alright"" until Venom arrives. I didn't know Michelle Williams was in this movie until I saw her, and she is great. Her brief appearance as female Venom made me cheer and wanting more of that. How cool woul it be if both of them would have a symbiont and team up. Riz Ahmed is a really good actor, because I hated him the first moment he appeared on screen. The movie is a bit of a slow burner because they spend over 30 minutes until the fun kicks in, but then it REALLY kicks in. Venom is funny as hell. In my opinion he's the better Rocket, because Rocket always seems forced funny while Venom is purely instinct driven and the funny part occurs in bizzare ways. In comparison Deadpool is eye blink funny, Venom is absolutely dark funny and that's really great. And there we come to the ..ckheads at Sony for cutting out 40 minutes and forcing a PG13 at it. You're the stupidest people on this planet and I hope you die. Seriously. Venom would agree with me, while biting their heads off. And then there is the other ..ckmove of not putting this in the MCU. As I said, Venom is funny and would be a great addition to the family. Especially knowing that the Avengers will come to an end (at least the team as it is now) after the next Infinity War movie and with the introduction of Captain Marvel. I can't stand the fact, that neither Sony or Disney/Marvel give a damn about the fans. It's always about the effing money and what dumb people in ugly suits think.
I hope they will overthink all this and include the character into the MCU, where it belongs.","10/10"

"Venom","JohnDeSando","4 October 2018","Venom is a surprise: It's funny; it's mad; and much to my delight, it has an antihero more interesting than a pile of other Marvel superheroes on most days. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is an ace TV street reporter who manages to lose his job pursuing a demented inventor, Dr. Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), while managing to become the host for an ugly but sometimes comical slimy alien parasite or ""symbiote.""Although film Venom is replete with the usual superhero tropes like the slow-to-get-it love interest, Anne (Michelle Williams), the demented scientist, the threat to the world, and toothy monsters, it has a levity Deadpool could admire, but to a much lesser extent. Not a small number of light moments come from the dialogue between Eddie and his occupying alien Venom, who decides he likes Eddie and the planet so he won't be the one to destroy it. There are others like him to do it.As in so many of these horror, sci fi thrillers, the amount of violence from explosions and body tossing is too much. Director Ruben Fleischer could have minimized the scenes and substituted more of the ironic dialogue that makes this a watchable adventure. Scott Rosenberg and the other writers are up to the task.Hardy's winning characterization of a rough-around-the-edges hero who has to stop evil is punctuated with naivete, innocence, and a sense of justice and humor. With no Spiderman to distract him, Venom can form a friendship with his parasite that, as they shamble away together, may remind some of the super classic, Casablanca. Hardy is no Bogey, but his Brock is quirky and eccentric enough for me to hope for a sequel, even with Spiderman to distract.","4/10"
"Venom","Leofwine_draca","20 January 2020","VENOM is a surprisingly awful Marvel adaptation that doesn't sit at all well with the usual likes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its generally effective comic book adaptations. This one's far sillier and more nonsensical, as token bad guy Riz Ahmed works on some alien nasties in a laboratory and weird reporter Tom Hardy gets infected. The plot is as simple as that, but what is there to enjoy here? Hardy is known for eccentric characters and they often work (check out MAD MAX: FURY ROAD) but here he just comes across as annoying and his American accent doesn't sound good either. The second half moves into predictable comic book territory, i.e. an overload of CGI effects and not much in the way of thought. Things remain tame despite attempts at a harder edge, and the decision to have the alien talk made it all laughable for me.","10/10"
"Venom","burkholdermicah","3 October 2018","Venom is a truly Epic Superhero or SuperVillain Movie. It's a really Entertaining Watch, It's well Directed, The Action Scenes are Great, and it shows that even Spider-Man really can be Great. Venom is a truly terrifying beast and this is a really Amazing Movie. This is way better than what the Critics say about this Movie. They really don't know what they are talking about, and this is one of those really rare occasions when the Critics are wrong about almost everything. I am honestly disgusted by the Negativity revolving around this Movie. I don't know why they would prefer Amazing Spider-Man 2 over this Movie. I will definitely be looking foreword to the Sequel and all of the other SuperVillain Movies to come.

"Venom","ferguson-6","4 October 2018","Greetings again from the darkness. For those movie-goers who believe there is no need for another comic book movie, you now have People's Exhibit A. This is the 5th Marvel film of 2018 (yep, that's a new one every other month!), and it's the first one proving challenging to say much of anything that is positive or complimentary. The packed house at the screening had very few reactions during the movie, and seemed deflated afterwards.It should be noted that this is not a Superhero movie, but rather a film based on the Marvel Comic characters and stories of Todd McFarlane and David Michelinie. Four writers are credited with the screenplay, and it seems they either needed more or fewer. Director Ruben Fleisher (ZOMBIELAND, 2009) apparently worked with what he was given, hoping the stellar cast or the CGI could salvage the project. The always terrific Tom Hardy (Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) stars as Eddie Brock, a renowned investigative reporter popular for breaking stories of corruption and fraud. Unfortunately, he has a significant lapse in ethics - an unusually forthright comment from Hollywood on today's media. This lapse costs Brock his job, his girlfriend (4 time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams), and any semblance of normalcy. While investigating the unimaginable human-alien experiments of megalomaniac Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), Brock takes on the powers of the symbiote (Venom) and spends the rest of the movie either trying to control these powers, sitting back and letting the powers take over, or exchanging frat boy dialogue with the possessive being who picked up all nuances of the English language pretty darn quickly.Venom was last seen in the lackluster SPIDER-MAN 3 and was played by Topher Grace. This time out, Venom is the focus and Spidey is nowhere to be found or mentioned ... at least not until post credits (a terrific animated sequence). The CGI is at times very impressive - reminiscent of something John Carpenter might have ordered. Two sides of the Transamerica Pyramid provide a nice visual, however, the effects are not at all consistent. Far too often ... especially the battle between Venom and Riot ...it's just plain messy (like letting a group of toddlers play with black and gray slime). The film's saving grace could have been the interactions between Mr. Hardy and Ms. Williams, both stellar actors, but the dialogue and situations are so ridiculous that even those scenes don't click. The moments that draw laughter from the audience may or may not have been by design, but there are far too many 'forced comedic moments' that just fall flat. Composer Ludwig Goransson (CREED, BLACK PANTHER) delivers some nice moments with the score, but the Eminem song over the closing credits sounds amateurish. The film is very loud, and not so much lacking direction as it is burdened with too many directions and misfires. A comic book movie's first priority is to be fun, and this one just isn't much of that. Surprisingly, the film is rated PG-13 rather than R, so the excessive violence (and there is plenty) never actually spills a drop of blood. Perhaps the goal was to make a Marvel movie so uninspiring that BLACK PANTHER's Oscar chances would be enhanced. Otherwise, there's no excuse.","10/10"

"Venom","paul_haakonsen","1 December 2018","Right, well granted my lack of interest in superhero movies, then I couldn't exactly claim to be thrilled when this movie was announced, even so when it hit the cinema. So it was only when given the chance to watch it that I got around to it. Can't exactly claim that ""Venom"" was high on my movies to watch.First of all, well aside from it being a superhero movie, then I wasn't particularly enthralled with it being Tom Hardy having the lead role. Not much of a fan of his, to be honest. But I will say that he carried the movie quite nicely, despite having very little to work with in terms of a thoroughly-crafted script. Yeah, the storyline was fairly simplistic, and the script was almost so light-weight that it was non-existing.The special effects and CGI in the movie were adequate. They weren't the kind that have you going ""wow, that's spectacular and impressive"". So for a movie made in 2018 it felt that they cut back on the effects budget in a way.Now, I was having a bit of a hard time whether to take the movie as a serious movie, or if it was meant to be a comedy. Venom was all over the place, in terms of it being a comedy movie or a serious movie, and even had elements that bordered on horror on it. But it was sort of hard to take some of the things that Venom said seriously.I wasn't impressed by ""Venom"". And to be honest, then it would have taken very little to impress me, because I am not a fan of superhero movies and tend to avoid them. I am sure that there is a fanbase for ""Venom"" out there, but for us that aren't attuned to the superhero genre, then ""Venom"" had very little to offer in terms of entertainment, aside from being a generic action movie.","7/10"

"Venom","CinemaClown","28 November 2018","A strong contender for the worst film of the year, Venom is an amalgamation of terrible direction, piss-poor writing & fidgety performances that crashes n burns Sony's hopes of launching its very own shared universe on a positive & promising note, for there isn't one thing redeemable in this incoherent & inconsistent mess.The story follows Eddie Brock, an investigative reporter who while enquiring into a major corporation's malpractice comes into contact with an alien symbiote that was brought to Earth by their probe. As the two species achieve full symbiosis, he is imbued with superhuman strength & a violent alter-ego that calls itself Venom.Directed by Ruben Fleischer, the film fails to pave the necessary groundwork and it doesn't get any better after the first act either. The whole thing feels hurried & chaotic, unsure of what it wants to be, as the plot becomes more ridiculous with every passing moment. Fleischer's direction is lazy and the writing is even worse.All its attempts at humour fall flat, the dialogues are cringeworthy and whatever action it has in store has no sense of excitement whatsoever since the characters are so poorly sketched that we are never invested in them. Not a single person in this story exhibits an interesting arc and the eponymous anti-hero is a total joke.Coming to the performances, Tom Hardy is monstrously bad as both Eddie Brock & Venom. He is way too fidgety as if high on drugs, long before becoming a host to the alien symbiote, and his act is as stupid as it is laughable. Michelle Williams & Riz Ahmed happily dent their acting careers for a healthy paycheck. Also, for a $100 million budget film, the VFX looks absurdly dated & cartoonish.On an overall scale, Venom is a lethargic, listless & lifeless blockbuster that easily goes down as one of the worst examples of its kind. Failing to provide a sense of intrigue at any given time, it's one idiotic segment stacked on top of another for a total of 112 minutes and just when you think the film has got nowhere to go but up, it surprises you. A dud in all aspects of filmmaking, Venom is no less than an absolute eyesore.","7/10"
"Venom","dogmaticdogs","6 October 2018","I wonder if all the hate is because Sony produced this film outside of the Marvel Studio universe because I actually found it very entertaining. There was a lot of action, and the special effects were very good. The movie theater was full, and many people were laughing out-loud and clapped after the movie. Yes, the main character was kind of corny, but I found Venom's human ego less corny than Iron Man or Captain America. I also found it refreshing that it occurred in a world that wasn't already occupied by other super heroes. It seemed more realistic and adult oriented than other marvel character movies, but I would have preferred it being a bit darker rather than light hearted.I am not a huge fan of super hero movies other than Dark Knight, but I really enjoyed this. It shouldn't win any awards, but if you like the genre, I found it better than most. The movie suggested that Tom Hardy was a loser before he became Venom. If he was a loser, what the hell does that make me?","8/10"
"Venom","gerry_barnaby","3 October 2018","Venom is it any good.......... Well i'l be honest it good but there is a lot of issues I had with it, the certification isn't one, which im glad they took it to at least a 15 cert instead of the stupid 12A- PG-13 route because it allows the character to be a bit better, but I do feel the R-rating would have been better.The Biggest problem with Venom being a low certification is carnage, which could be in a sequel if this film is a success in box office, its need to push it to R-rating because of the PG13- 12A, 15 certs won't work for it.Not that im saying this venom film was a disaster because it's not but the film does have some major issues in it casting and storytelling, which is a shame because there are areas in this film that were generally funny (mainly the building scene) The humour is very sarcastic from the character of venom, so it gonna be that moment unless you find sarcastic humour funny, you might not like the humour in this film. Tom Hardy hardy performance is brilliant in playing the report asking the hard the questions and pushing boundary that everyone doesn't dare ask, this is how the real reporter gets the hard truth and doesn't makeup thing for a story.Tom performance give a great scared and vulnerable person when he first meets venom, giving off a guy that has no clue what the hell is going on which sell the character more, Venom himself is a awesome character but so hell back slight with the Certification. I noticed at the beginning of the film, which not a lot of people born after the 90s won't know about is the very scene at this point was actually the original storyline of Venom origin to earth with a slight story chance that was more plausible for the story which did help.We get a lot of great fight scenes through the film, with a few moments of funny humour (if you can get the sarcastic humour) while the film does maintain some element of that dark edge. The visual effects are great on venom especial the humour, but there is an area with the visual that is bad. This sadly is where im gonna have to rip into the film bad points there a few of them. Dislikes: 1. Casting. Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake / Riot, Riz is a good actor, even I can see that but playing the antagonist villian in the film, ya sorry just wasn't feeling it, not sure if it was the writing for character or just the way he was he's portraying this role, he just didn't have that ruthless charismatic tone to be a character. This sadly makes the villian of the film very generic which I hate because it pulls the film down.2. Casting. Michelle Williams playing Anne Weying, Again Michelle is a great actress ive seen her is so many great films where she shined given a great performance in those films. Here in venom again great performance but I feel she was the wrong casting for this role, I'll explain, there was zero chemistry between William and Hardy on the screen. Which made the romance and relationship together feel forced instead of feeling a natural connection with each other, I feel this Me to concept just didn't work in this film. 3. Visual effects. The motorbike chase there is a moment where it takes you out of the immersion of the chase which blantant Green screen shots, there was a moment where you can blatantly see that a stunt scene that it was Tom Hardy on the bike and a stunt double. I feel the close up scene of Tom Hardy on the bike were unnecessary, could have been edit out the film, because the rest of the scene was perfect.4. The story. The story felt very generic, Venom didn't show up until almost halfway through the second act but before we could get any build up with a showdown with Riot, the film was already over, this is where the writing failed. You have too many people writing on a story you get a mess of a film because of it, the direction of the film is going in serval direction and the moments that just don't seemly fit together. The flow of the film with it pacing is off which is bad for the film, this is why this film comes off great but still generic, I mean the whole build up between Roit and venom should have been from the end of the first act and not dragged out until the halfway through the second act. This is why I feel the film is Great in places but overall generic where the film could've been better. Overall: Great acting, Funny sarcastic moment, Great but generic story and bad casting with a generic villian","2/10"

"Venom","bastille-852-731547","16 October 2018","Despite poor reviews from critics, ""Venom"" is making quite a lot of money at the box office right now. Maybe it's because of the popularity of the character, or maybe even the fact that some casual audiences may (incorrectly) believe it is part of the MCU. I didn't think it looked very good and was not planning to see it in theaters originally, and only went to see it because of an online ticketing coupon which made it free. That said, I went in optimistic, as there have been some films this year that looked unappealing yet I ended up finding them enjoyable (e.g. ""The Spy Who Dumped Me."") But despite my optimistic sentiment, ""Venom"" was not just bad, it was really bad.I like Tom Hardy as an actor, but his acting is incredibly weak here. He is not really given much of a range to work with, which isn't necessarily his fault, but his portrayal of Eddie Brock is wholly unconvincing. The film's ""origin story"" tropes are rather tired, but that's nothing compared to the film's atrocious script. The script for this film is one of the worst in recent memory, with unbelievably cheesy dialogue or very clich√© dialogue (e.g. Brock saying ""what is wrong with me?"" after feeling sick, etc.) coming at the viewer in almost every scene. Additionally, the film's tonal mishaps give the film a major identity crisis. ""Venom"" can't decide whether it wants to be an action-comedy a la traditional Marvel movies or a sci-fi horror flick a la ""Alien."" The problem is that the movie struggles with both tones. The attempts at humor in the movie feel incredibly forced and unfunny. Despite some creepy images of body horror and one or two jump scares, the movie is not particularly scary either. As a result, the movie just feels like a mishmash that was thrown together. The only remotely decent thing about it is an engaging car chase scene about halfway through. Definitely not recommended. 2/10","6/10"
"Venom","pardes2002","5 December 2018","This is my first review, I am a big marvel fan and love the Venom character. When I watched the trailers I can defo say I was impressed with the Venom Suit, this is how the suit should look like rather than the Spider-Man 3 VersionI wanted to like this movie however I walked out so disappointed- Tom hardy is a very good actor who had the ability to get under the skin of a character I.e Bane, Mad Max, Bronson however in this case he just wasn't any good, He doesn't actually give justice to the roleThe plot made no sense and had no flow... there wasn't a single character that stood out that made the movie worth watching. The director really took on something more than he couldnt handle..As for the CGI wow it was really really bad... it was like a 10 year old doing it... where on other marvel studio movies the CGI looks really impressive It felt like Venom CGI was rushed and done by amateursI left the movie feeling quite disappointed and thinking had Marvel Studios had the rights on Venom they could have made this a really good movie.The critics have got this Spot OnFinal thought - Don't waste ur time and money on this movie and if there is to be a Venom 2 I really hope Marvel Studios make it!","1/10"

In the end it's going to be better off without the MCU formula being forced down everyone's throat with her tired themes and tropes. Eddie Brock's/venom's Symbiote story is a very intriguing one that doesn't necessarily need Spiderman to succeed and I think this will prove a lot of people wrong and stupid for doubting it. Also the critics...don't even get me started on how terrible and pretentious these loony critics are where they dismantle every film that does not fit their liberal PC propaganda. The fact that there are so many sheep that will blindly follow these mindless cretins and let them dictate whether not they enjoy or see a movie R just sad human beings without any free thinking ability . Most people look at credit scores and reviews and already have their pre-determined opinions made up to go see the movie and then bash it directly after finding abhorrently stupid excuses as to why they hated it .

Only good thing was tom hardy's performance and eddie brock's bromance with venom.

"Venom","Offworld_Colony","12 February 2020","A film that seems to have been written in the 90's, desperate to keep a lower budget, a PG13, and a wide audience so it doesn't bother being a good horror, a good antihero movie, or a good sci-fi. It sort of manages to be a passable buddy movie but only just, and probably due to a bonkers Tom Hardy who is clearly having the time of his life.
There's so much in the idea to have unlimited potential, and yet it's a hole-ridden, lily-white superhero film with only marginally more actual Venom than Raimi's Spider-Man 3, and all the beats of a run of a mill early superhero film. Unfortunately since Deadpool, a Venom movie would have to have upped its game. Sometimes it's fun, most of the while, it's depressingly by the numbers.","9/10"

"Venom","BandSAboutMovies","28 December 2018","Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad), Venom has appeared on plenty of worst of lists this year. I held back judgment until I saw the movie. I can sum it up in one word: underwhelming. But after all, who was clamoring for a Venom movie after Spider-Man 3? Who was needing one in 2018? And after the magic of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, why do filmmakers feel they can still be so lazy with superheroes?
That said, Venom is critic proof. After all, it was a box office success, ultimately earning $855 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.It all comes down to one good thing: Tom Hardy. It's like this dude has to have the craziest voices in movies. His Eddie Brock voice is just the most need to please accent ever, while Venom, in his own words, is a ""James Brown lounge lizard."" The relationship between these two characters -- who become one person -- is the best part of the movie. Hardy also improvised a lot, such as when he jumps into a lobster tank to cool down. I kind of love that the dude was pretty much making up his own film. The actor claimed that he based his performance on Woody Allen, Conor McGregor and Redman.Everything else -- from the villains to Eddie Brock's relationships -- is as generic as it gets. Big points for having Jenny Slate in here, even if she does nothing. It's like the film felt it had to give us an origin when all we want to see is Venom break stuff. The end of the film, where he eats a criminal and meets Cletus ""Carnage"" Kasady (and come on, who doesn't want to watch Matthew McConaughey against Hardy in a battle of accents and overacting) is exactly what everyone really wants, not nearly two hours of generic soldiers and Venom battling Elon Musk.In the spin of selling this movie, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch claimed that ""Venom was considered a spin on a horror film, inspired by the works of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, but with more pop and fun."" People that say these kinds of things have never seen films by these two directors. Get their words out of your mouth and make better movies.The hard part of this whole thing is that there's a tease of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which will either make you say, ""I should have just watched that"" or ""Man, that was such a better movie.""","8/10"
"Venom","NarniaIsAwesome","6 January 2019","After seeing Venom's character in 'Spider-Man 3,' I was a bit excited for this film. It had potential for being fun and awesome. But it was no more than the typical Marvel disappointment.It wasn't poorly made in terms of budget or even acting, really - it's just a little shallow and boring. Tom Hardy is a quite unlikable character, and even when he gets Venom he can't pull it off. There is one well choreographed motorcycle scene though, and that's the reason for the three stars I gave it. And who on earth was Woody Harrelson supposed to be?My biggest question is how this Venom fits into 'Spider-Man 3.' 'Venom' is

Although the film had its intense, scary moments, it was another marvel comedy. However, this was a pleasant surprise and made the film even more enjoyable. Tom Hardy played the role brilliantly, absolutely nailed it. But do not expect a violent horror film. The three times he did eat someone's head, it was either not viewable to the audience or contained no blood and gore and happened mostly off screen. Apart from all of this, the film felt short, rushed at points and the direction of the story changes throughout. I would still say it is a must see as I thoroughly enjoyed it.","4/10"

It's just such a missed opportunity. This could have been a good movie if they had just put some effort into it.Look, I have nothing against mindless action movies, but there's absolutely nothing impressive about this one. The plot, the jokes, the characters, the action scenes...they're all terribly flat and generic. Everything about this movie is painfully mediocre except for a few brief moments of high-priced CGI, and even that ends up being mostly underwhelming because the scenes containing it range from bland to awful.Even if you turn your brain off entirely and are hugely obsessed with the character of Venom, even being generous, this is AT BEST an utterly average movie, deserving of nothing more than a 6 or 7. Personally I'd rate it at around a 5 because even if you ignore everything but the action scenes, it's still an entirely forgettable experience that I'll never watch again. In the end though, I'm giving it a 1 just to balance out the absolutely insane number of people giving this generic cash-in movie a 10.

Almost 40 minutes were cut out and those scenes were Hardy's favorite moments shooting this film. Hardy was the best part and honestly the only good thing about the film. Everything else was a mess. I appreciate that Sony tried to be as comic accurate to the character as possible, but it wasn't enough. The tone was everywhere. I can't even begin to tell how bad on what they were trying to do, because I don't even know. Side characters do their part and that's that. I don't understand why the even want to try go with a PG-13 rating. Venom doesn't need the MCU and the MCU doesn't need venom. If the movie would have stayed with the R rating.

But, Tom Hardy acts his little heart out ( and so does Riz Ahmed) and the movie, while not perfect, is fun.P.s. The mid credit scene gives one hope!","1/10"
"Venom","iamtoxxic","6 October 2018","The whole movie is a cringe fest. It feels embarrassing watching TomHardy play Eddie Brock. None of the actors were right for their roles. Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed were not suited to play their characters. The movie is full of cliched dialogues. Each time Venom opens his mouth it feels like Bane is talking. There is no story. And nothing is explained well at all.I feel like either Will Arnett or Will Smith would have done a better job as Eddie Brock. And maybe that might have made this movie worth watching?","3/10"
"Venom","dhdregun","9 October 2018","Venom isn't a Marvel movie, for that it succeeds far more than if it had been. If you're getting tired of the Marvel formula then Venom is going to be a breath of fresh symbiotic air. Venom occupies it's own universe, it's dark, gritty and more grown up compared to its counterparts. The existence of Eddie's personal life feels real, his struggles are far more relatable than any other character portrayed in a comic book movie so far. He is an everyday guy who screws up and because of that his need to redeem himself gets him attached to a symbiote. After that hes just trying to stay alive until the very end when the truth of his circumstance means he is the only one who can prevent humanities destruction. The movie didnt lead up to this, it wasnt even known what was to come until the last 20 minutes of the movie.This is a marriage of two separate movies and it's done very well. You remove Venom and the movie feels like it could stand on it's own with a few key changes. The Venom portion hits all the notes required for a superhero movie. You actually care about Eddy and it's not because they give some sappy back story about loss or self reflection. You care because you can actually relate with what happens to him and how you may have reacted in the same scenario. He wasnt rich, a god or born with powers, didnt live with super advanced technology or volunteer for an experiment. Hes just a guy with a 9-5 in a regular relationship and living in the same world where shake downs and homelessness exist.The critics wanted a different movie then what they got. They wanted a basic Marvel super hero movie without realizing one of the better super hero movies as of late (Logan) didnt follow that formula either.Venom is the movie that stands on its own by creating a story with elements suited to the character, not checkboxes like others. Its entertaining and feels like it could have lasted longer. I'd rather feel left wanting then feeling like the movie is now requiring me to continue watching it because it's been dragged out too long.I'd rather watch another Venom movie then any other marvel universe sequel at this point.","10/10"

"Venom","Felixhug","30 November 2018","There are so many Marvel movies produced now, that it becomes hard to be actually entertained by them. They really have to be of exceptional acting and writing to overcome the foreseeable outcome. All the fake action and blue screen shots and all the fancy tricks...its just not enough anymore.While i really loved some of the Marvel adaptions and other comics coming to the screen as well, this one was not one of them. I find myself gravitating to better, more original movies, or at least something if it has to be so predictable that is of superior excecution. None of it is to be seen in Venom. It all comes across as: Not again the same boring storyline!Luckily there where some better action movies this year that made up for it with real action such as MI. Thanks god there are still people like Tom Cruise, who actually take pride in what they do.
Its refreshing to see somebody applying real skills to a movie and not CGI combined with rushed screenwriting.","5/10"

"Venom","CriticalOfEverything","3 October 2018","Just when I thought that NOTHING could top The Happytime Murders as the worst movie of the year, Venom comes out. I already thought the movie looked awful and the writing from the trailers was atrocious, but surely it couldn't of been worse than all the other terrible movies I've seen this year, right? Venom is a mess. It is only able to be enjoyed ironically. It feels INCREDIBLY dated. If this movie came out 10 years ago like it should have then I could probably excuse it, but it decided to come out in 2018. The writing is atrocious and it has one of the most inconsistent tones ever. Is it meant to be a horror/thriller? Or is it meant to be a comedy? Having comedy and darkness spread throughout your movie is fine but with Venom it just feels like they had no idea what tone to give it. Eddie Brock is also a massive moron in this movie and I'm just so disappointed with the fact that there will never be a good movie to use Venom well. Spider-Man 3 was utter garbage and used Venom poorly, and now this movie, with it's ONE GOAL of trying to make Venom work in a movie, fails on every level. Please don't see this if you want a thrilling and serious movie. This isn't that. This is a top notch comedy act done by Tom Hardy's terrible casting for this role.","4/10"
"Venom","Quebec_Dragon","4 October 2018","As other reviews pointed out, the tone was all over the place and the comedy didn't mix well with the darker parts. As a horror movie, it failed because there was poor tension, creepiness and no gore despite the potential. As a comedy it failed because it was not really funny for me even though some Venom fans laughed at his every line (why?). The action parts were too busy, chaotic and hard to follow, especially when Venom was involved. Tom Hardy really tried hard and emoted a lot, sometimes too much, but ended up looking goofy and dumb too often. The events of the plot felt rushed, and sometimes downright stupid. In fact, repeatedly, the behaviour of the characters didn't seem believable. Overall, this movie irritated me and reminded me of bad, older superhero movies (even though Venom is no superhero, I know). I watched this at an advance screening in a full theatre, and there was no applause at the end.Rating: 3 out of 10 (poor)P.S. For Marvel fans, there's no real connection to the rest of the universe, so you can easily skip it or wait for home viewing.","7/10"
"Venom","UniqueParticle","21 August 2019","I must say it would've been a thousand times better if it was R-Rated like it was supposed to!

Tom hardy is the most unlikely lead I'm shocked he's so popular. I'm just glad I didn't see in in theatres to pay good money for that film would have been insane .","10/10"
"Venom","aldo-64339","3 October 2018","Where to start? Well, how this has got bad reviews is just baffling? I'm sure there must be some Marvel heirachy politics at play possibly. 
Tom Hardy is just brilliant, totally believable as the down and out who inherits a new lease of life and new host inside him. There is immediate rapport between them with some real laugh out loud moments. He definitely understands comedic timing. 
Michelle Williams supports perfectly and is never over the top nor surplus to requirements. 
Riz Ahmed holds his own and comes off just with the right amount of 'bad'.
The action sequences are well done, often at night and deliver without over cooking it. 
Overall, two hours whizzes by and yes, the plot is not going to surprise you and you pretty much know what's coming, but the ride is well worth it in the end. Definitely a Marvel movie I would watch over and over and I can't say that for a lot of Marvel movies to be honest. Recommend! Don't believe the anyi-hype. Go see!","5/10"
"Venom","Jared_Andrews","5 October 2018","Venom the movie, much like Venom the character, is a sloppy, amorphous mishmash that attempts to be too many things and ultimately fails at all of them. At various times, it tries its hand at horror, slapstick comedy, self-aware comedy, romance and drama. That's an ambitious combination that would make any movie difficult to take seriously, let alone one with a wisecracking alien blob monster.The chilling opening scene shows a private space exploration mission return to Earth with samples of alien symbiotes. Shockingly, something goes wrong, one sample escapes and jumps between human hosts, searching for the best fit. It's a chilling sequence that sets the tone for a much darker story than what actually follows. In a jarringly clunky transition, the story jumps to Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy doing his idea of a New York accent) and his fianc√©, Anne (Michelle Williams) living happily in San Francisco. Hardy goes all in on playing the anxious, twitchy guy who is great at his job but is also kind of a loser and has the most peculiar gait. He walks the way someone would walk if you told them, ""hey, walk in the weirdest way possible, like in a way that no one would ever actually walk."" It's completely transfixing. Eddie's awkward walk aligns with his natural tendency to create awkward situations. He is a successful reporter who is known for pushing boundaries, so it's only too obvious what he will do when interviewing shady billionaire, Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), for what is supposed to be a puff piece. In another less-than-stellar transition, the timeline fast-forwards six months and shows Eddie's life in shambles. This might have been affecting if any of this felt earned, but certain essential scenes are absent and were likely trimmed in editing to put the final runtime under two hours. Choices like these give the entire film a rushed, erratic feel of something that had ideas but didn't know how to piece them together into a fluid story arc.Meanwhile, all this has happened and still Venom has yet to make an appearance. The movie spends too much time on nonessential plot points and takes too long to reach the most compelling and entertaining parts. In other words, the movie is called Venom, so put Venom in the movie. When Venom finally shows up, the movie finally has life. Sort of. Venom and Eddie exchange banter that occasionally delivers winning punchlines, a few of which caused outbursts of laughter throughout the theater. That's great. The problem is the dozens of other jokes that were met with crickets or confusion. This might be due to Venom's abrupt language advancements. He quickly evolves from monosyllabic commands of ""food!"" to offering insightful romantic advice. It's another case of unearned plot and character development. But the worst parts of the movie are the incomprehensible and nearly unwatchable action sequences that didn't follow any discernable rules of continuity or visual logic. I didn't know where to look and half the time I didn't even know what I was looking at. That's the downside of fight scenes that rely too heavily on CGI. The climactic fight scene involves a bizarre swirling tornado of Venom and another blob monster that is meant to resemble a warrior-like battle, but the comically wide-open mouths and tongue swinging turns the display into something that looks more like a sloppy teenage make out session.It's a dumb scene in a dumb movie that never quite figures itself out. Marvel has made many great movies over the past 10 years. Venom is not one of them.","2/10"

"Venom","cherold","17 April 2019","I hadn't intended to watch Venom after hearing of its critical drubbing, but when I saw it got a respectable 6.8 from user reviews I thought maybe it was worth taking a look.It wasn't. It isn't.This first thing to be said about Venom is it is really, really boring. The setup, in which we see Eddie Brock's pre-Venom life, goes on forever (well, maybe a half hour), interspersed on with a few look-how-evil-I-am scenes for the villain. At a certain point I started using the skip-forward button on my video player to see if I could find where the action started.As for the action, it was fine, I suppose. Venom's shape-shifting abilities lead to some decent moments. Not *great* moments, but decent.In fact, if you removed all the non-action scenes you'd have something short but tolerable. But it would be very short, because even when the movie kicks into its highest gear, there's still a lot of down time.The repartee between Venom and Brock is okay, but Upgrade, which I haven't seen yet, has a more entertaining take on the same basic concept in the *trailer*.Some critics described this movie as awful but entertainingly so. This is not true. This is unentertainingly awful. It should not be watched, by anyone, ever. The people rating it highly on IMDB should seek psychiatric help.","1/10"
"Venom","roel-willemsen","11 October 2018","Overall, the film was extremely disappointing. Its positive points include Hardy's performance and the restaurant scene, one of the more uncomfortably funny scenes in a while. 
The pacing of the film is entirely off, starting of semi-promising, but having no Venom in the first half of the film and following it with a string of basic and bland CGI fights was not the way to go. The CGI is probably the worst part of the film, ranging from mediocre to downright awful. Especially the scene where the symbiote moves out of Eddie Brock's body to talk to him reminds of the 1997 film Spawn, aka awful. 
The script and dialogue are terribly basic. Michelle Williams is wasted as a love interest and is given some of the worst dialogue in the film (""I told you I could fight dirty."") 
Riz Ahmed's bad guy is somewhat interesting in human form, though his motives are never thoroughly explained, but in symbiote form he's downright awful. 'Riot' shows up suddenly at the end of the film as the big bad and is then promptly defeated in a boring CGI fight.
Furthermore, the best thing about Venom in the comics is that he's an anti-hero, something that doesn't shine through in the film. Eddie Brock's conflict about whether or not deciding to accept the symbiote is overshadowed in the plot and I believe that the film would have profited from an R-rating.
Sony should probably just let Marvel do all the work from now on. Having Hardy's Venom team up with Tom Holland's Spider-Man to take on Woody Harrelson's Carnage is a film I would like to see.
To conclude, don't waste your time with this boring attempt at an anti-hero movie.","3/10"

"Venom","GavinM87","13 October 2018","Well, I guess it was only a matter of time before Tom Hardy did a bad film. I don't really blame him in a sense, he did what he could with his character of Eddie Brock/Venom. I blame the director and the writers for coming up with the worst comic book movie of the year! I was actually really looking forward to this, despite the really bad reviews online, but it just goes to show sometimes the critics do know what they are talking about...","7/10"
"Venom","TheMovieDiorama","11 October 2018","Oh dear. Superhero fatigue really is hitting hard this year. Sony is attempting every possibility just to keep the rights of a superhero intellectual property that is ""in association with Marvel"". Trying to kickstart yet another cinematic universe. I have no objections for these kind of blockbusters. As long as they entertain, they serve their purpose. This though, this is the complete opposite of entertainment. It's a catastrophic symbiotic mess. Eddie Brock, a well renowned journalist, loses everything by undertaking one interview. A few months later, he encounters a extraterrestrial life form known as Venom, where the two must stop another ""symbiote"" from destroying the world. Subjectively speaking, this is the worst blockbuster of the year for all the wrong reasons. But, let's start the review with some much needed positivity. Hardy, although incredibly miscast, commands onscreen presence and gives Brock a layer of likability. His schizophrenic-like behaviour with Venom manages to remain amusing, albeit frequently forced, reminiscent of the ""Buddy cop"" sub-genre. Venom, an anti-hero who suddenly turns into the world's saviour, maintains an enigmatic quality that feels alluring. Stan Lee's cameo is always a delight? I may be clutching at straws here for positive aspects, particularly with that last comment. There are so many underlying issues with Venom, that detailing them all would be a challenge in itself. Firstly, the narrative is tonally inconsistent. We have traits of the comedic 'Deadpool', action from 'The Incredible Hulk' and obviously the structure of 'Spider-Man'. It's not even inconsistent by scene, every act is so vastly different in tone that it doesn't feel like a complete film. Starting off as a generic romance, then breaking into the generic ""buddy cop"" action whilst also attempting to embed dark humour that forcibly feels negatively hilarious. The reason for this is the bad editing. Hardly any of the scenes have a narrative flow, with specific points in the plot being inserted at the incorrect time.This is particularly noticeable when portraying the antagonistic Carlton Drake, who's motives and backstory are thrown around like a ""symbiote"" on a rocket burning up through the atmosphere. One moment he wants to save humanity, the immediate proceeding scene portrays him wanting to destroy it. The horrifically written script, accompanied by unfunny quips that did not suit Hardy's acting talent, relies on an outdated superhero formula. Sony have failed to realise that these films have substantially evolved since the early 2000's. The ""save the world"" clich√© and formulaic origin story are buried. Formulaic is an understatement, the story is atrociously predictable with its one-dimensional characters and heroic clich√©s that even the infrequent action scenes (all two and a half of them) couldn't generate any entertainment. The final showdown was a CGI ball of mess, making it particularly difficult to see what was actually happening. The motorbike segment was too pedestrian and lacked any excitement. Any combat scenes felt clunky and cumbersome, despite the innovative stunt choreography between Hardy and Venom. Ahmed gave a generically dull performance as the villain, one that I shan't remember anytime soon. Williams tried her best but again felt miscast as she attempts to create an emotional layer of depth between herself and Hardy. Oh, and Slate was underused, considering she has the most involving character. The slight comedic quips that Brock and Venom share are excruciatingly cringe inducing, trying so hard to make the audience laugh. There comes a point when Venom says ""pussy"", and I face-palmed so hard.Then we come to my favourite criticism of all. Plot conveniences. How did Drake know that Brock got the information from his girlfriend, leading to her firing? Venom was set on leaving Earth, how and why did Brock suddenly change his perspective? Why would he stay? (Don't even say because they are both ""losers""). How did Weying know to operate the speaker system at the launch pad? How did Venom survive? And why do megalomaniacs constantly keep killing their employees? Trust me, I really wanted to enjoy this. I went in with the best of intentions. But it's just not good. Completely outdated, utterly formulaic and so close to equalling the catastrophic disaster that was 'Fant4stic'. If it wasn't for Hardy giving a crazy Nicholas Cage performance by jumping into a fish tank brimming with lobsters at a restaurant, this would have nothing remotely amusing. Venom failed to find an antidote and instead succumbed to the poisonous traits of corporation cash grabbing by injecting no imagination or effort into the film, marking an all-time low in Hardy's career.","8/10"

"Venom","raskarl","3 October 2018","I went to this film with no real expectation beyond knowing that Tom Hardy was playing in the main role and Venom is from the Spider-verse. I walked away thinking what a fabulous job had been done to bring good mixture of action and comedy. I really enjoyed this film and am unsure why people would have rated it down. I've heard some say the acting was sub-par, that is not something I noticed to be honest. I don't go to these types of movies expecting Oscar worthy performances, but to be entertained for an hour or so. This film achieved that easily and surpassed expectations. I even had a few laughs thrown in for good measure.
If you are on the fence about whether to see this film, I would recommend you go see it - you're not likely to regret it. Also, I'm 80% there is going to be an epic sequel sometime in the not too distant future!
-Update; I went to see the film again for a second time...still hit the spot! Great soundtrack and there's a short clip about an upcoming animation film featuring some characters from the Spider-verse. It is literally buried right at the end of the credits (would have missed it unless I had to been told wait for it, so I'm paying it forward).","6/10"
"Venom","Andrew_Wiper","29 October 2018","Fun, wacky, over the top violence and a brazenly mad performance from Tom Hardy make this a pleasing experience at the movies. At under 2 hours it doesn't overstay its welcome. Ruben Fleischer who directed Zombieland, takes the director's chair For Venom and like Zombieland, makes a movie that you go to to have a good ol' time at the cinema! It doesn't take itself too seriously, has many moments of humour, and also many scary scenes too. Very cool visual effects! Tom Hardy only adds to the movie's likeability, because he knows how to play a down to earth character, and a mad man at the same time. The director and producers, it was said were paying a lot of homage to Films of David Cronenberg and John Carpenter. I couldn't help but think of The Thing while watching this, and yes if you enjoy movies like The Thing, and the crazy body horror of David Cronenberg, you will no doubt enjoy this. Take that and add it into a marvel movie about a hero/anti-hero and you have Venom. Sure they could have made it R rated, but honestly it didn't really bother me that much. It seemed like they pushed the PG-13 rating as far as they could go with this. A definite theatre watch! 8.5/10","7/10"

It is an ADVERTISEMENT for that terrible cartoon Spiderman that you'll likely see in the trailers. My group sat through 10+ minutes of credits to see what was after them, and we were lividly disappointed. It has nothing to do with Venom and it left us all genuinely angry. Please don't sit through the whole long list of credits only to disappoint yourselves. We all left the theater angry and ranting about it.","1/10"

The climax of final fight is not too 'wow'. The conclusions of final battle is not clear enough. Music score is not that specialSome positive aspects that can saved this movie are relationship between Eddy and Venom. Dialogues between Eddy and Venom can be ice breaker or melt the tense in some scenes. Some Eddy and Venom's interactions also generate some comedy scene and it's quite entertaining.

"Venom","Mccadoo","4 June 2019","I've suspected for some time now that many of the positive reviews on this site are bogus. Reading the reviews for this movie are the final proof I need;10 out of 10 reviews with over the top title lines like; ""Best movie ever"" or ""A masterpiece"". Hundreds and hundreds of them in which the reviewer writes a single paragraph, or even less at times, that does nothing more than tout how great the movie is and that you should ignore the critics and go see it. Something stinks here folks.And this movie convinces me because it got a whole lot of those 10/10 reviews and it is absolutely terrible. I mean, just awful. And yes, I know that here are a lot of brain dead drones out there who think any superhero movie is the equivalent of classic literature and gush over all of them, however awful they are. But not enough of them to account for so many 10's for such a bad movie.Why was it bad? Where do I start;Tom Hardy's character came across as a learning impaired teenager with a room temperature IQ. He talked liked a dolt, his actions throughout the movie made no sense, unless he was in fact at dolt. He was supposed to be a crack reporter yet his reporting style was atrocious and his sense of what reporters actually do was utterly absent. For a really good actor his performance was really bad.Michelle Williams; not even sure why she was in this movie unless it was for a paycheck. She was totally miscast and just not believable at all in her role. She couldn't pull of the funny bits (or what the director thought was funny) and she had zero chemistry with Hardy.The villain was about as villainous as a cranky high school kid. His actions in the movie were so illogical and senseless as to be stupid. You never understood what his motivation could possibly be because he didn't seem to know himself. And his staff were the most moronic bunch of scientists and doctors to appear on film since...well, since forever. As illogical and unmotivated as their boss was they were even more so. They were a bunch of sheep following along whatever he did. Oh, except for one of them, the woman who decided to turn whistleblower to Hardy's character then proceeded to do it in the most idiotic way possible. She may as well have come to work with a sign around her neck telling everyone it was her who let Hardly into the facility. Then she just sat in her office and waited to be killed. No one is that clueless.Humor; there was none even though the director and writer tried to inject it into the movie at every turn. Every single attempt fell so flat you could hear the thud in the theatre. The banter between Hardy's character and Venom sounded like the ramblings of two twelve year old's trying to be clever and failing miserably at it. It was immature and forced and just not funny. Michelle Williams character was just not clever, every time she tired to be edgy it was just embarrassing to watch. Trying to be Deadpool when you've already put together a putrid film is never going to go well.And finally, the CGI is this movie was truly awful. When I saw the previews I thought Venom looked like something from a kids Saturday morning cartoon show and assumed that in the movie it would be better. It wasn't, it still looked like a kids cartoon show. Venom was totally unbelievable as a real live entity, he just simply looked like a cartoon. And the non-threatening villain at the end even more so. They looked like special effects from a 80's or 90's movie only worse. Just absolutely terrible, I'd say it ruined the movie except that the movie was already ruined before Venom even made his first appearance.This is at best a mediocre children's movie, and I'm being kind. So yes, by all means DO believe the critics and avoid this train wreck at all cost.","7/10"

His acting skills are also off, as if he tries to act like an idiot in some kind of light hearted comedy. Not to mention he's portrayed as an ahole. Yeah.. totally offputting.venom jokes are coolmain villain is god-awful level of ""i am bad so i'll do bad things like all bad guys do""Overall it's alot better than other SONY takes on heroes-genre (amazing sipderman crap ugh), but overall it's kinda meh.","10/10"
"Venom","wannasmokebefore","13 December 2018","This is a must see! I like that it's associated with marvel but still done independently from marvel. This is now one of my favorite villain movies. You won't regret watching it. It was done very differently but in a very good way.","8/10"
"Venom","The-Sarkologist","5 October 2018","Now that Spiderman is back in the hands of Marvel, well sort of, it looks as if Sony needs to start digging around with what's left to see if they can turn it into a franchise. Well, they've had two shots at Spiderman, one one of them did have Venom pop in as a sort of bad guy, but it seems that he now has his own movie, albiet a much darker one. Basically the story is that we have this evil billionaire who found some parasites in space and decided to bring them back to Earth. However the ship crashed and one of them managed to escape. The other three though made it back to San Francisco.
 Then we have our hero, who happens to be a reporter, and it seems that everything is going right for him, expect that he decides to start digging where he shouldn't be digging, and suddenly finds himself out of work and without a girlfriend. I guess that's what happens when an investigative reporter is just a little too good at their job, and also asks just one too many questions that they shouldn't be asking - billionaires, especially evil ones, have a really nasty habit of making life really, really difficult for you.
 However, it turns out that he is given another chance to start digging up some dirt on this guy, namely because one of his scientists decides that she really doesn't like, well, ignoring the rules, so she sneaks him into the lab, where he suddenly finds himself in the same room with one of the parasites, and is subsequently infected. So, he we have it, the Venom origin story. You can probably guess what happens from there though - he faces the bad guy, almost dies, but is eventually successful and things start getting back on track. Sure enough, we also have Stan Lee and a mid-credits scene that sort of teases us for the next film in the series.
 The thing that caught me with Venom though was that it didn't seem to be all that long. Look, that isn't a bad thing, and sometimes short movies can actually be pretty good movies, particularly since they drop all of the really boring stuff out of it. Yeah, this film was actually quite fun, though I did find that the Venom costume was just a little too tacky for my tastes. I would say that I liked the story, and the character, but when it came to Venom being Venom, well, it did come across a little bit too cartoonish, but then again I suspect that it is somewhat closer to the comics than the MCU heroes.","7/10"
"Venom","namikazedante","12 February 2019","I was expecting this movie to be terrible after so many was hating on it and today I finally got my chance to see it and I gotta say everyone especially in the media doesn't know what they're talking about.This movie is better than Spider-man: Homecoming. I really didn't like it. I mean it was okay but not even near what a Spider-Man movie should be like.Anyway ! This movie had jokes that were actually funny. A main character that you actually felt and cared for. I think they made a fantastic job with a anti-hero that would be very difficult to put in a good light. Especially someone as bad as Venom. But where was Tom Hardy when they made that awful version of Venom in the third spider-man movie? He is perfect as Eddie Brock. And I really hope they make another movie with Spider-Man and Venom.Anyway it was a exciting, fun and interesting movie. And don't listen to all the haters because this is a movie worthy a watch.","10/10"
"Venom","jeymatt","10 October 2018","Go and watch it! Not your usual superhero movie, But the plot is awesome on how the horrific man eating alien Venom came about from villain to superhero! Exciting and thrilling with great CGI effects! p/s: do stay back for post-credit scenes!","8/10"
"Venom","CANpatbuck3664","7 October 2018","In most big budget action movies, the first complaint you hear is CGI overload. This is one of the rare occasions where I can say the CGI being so impressive was one of the best parts of Venom. Venom looks awesome as a creature, the way they chose to animate his look and his movement was impressive. The movie is also shot pretty well, they shoot in a lot of dingy locations before Eddie (Tom Hardy) interacts with Venom to help ground the movie, and I thought the action was handled pretty well. I wish that we had got the R-rated version to really see the potential of what Venom could do as a villain, but I liked the majority of the action scenes regardless.We get to spend a decent portion of the movie with Eddie before we get introduced to Venom and while the overall plot isn't completely fresh, I didn't think it was as bad or as routine as the critics did. They aren't breaking new ground in the genre with Eddie's story from laughing stock to redemptive hero, but it gets the job done. We get some unique banter from Eddie and Venom that had me laughing at different times in the movie. It was also a little hit or miss (which is true for all the dialogue in the script), but I chuckled like everyone else in the theatre did. Did Venom have a few plot holes? Yes, it did but the movie doesn't linger on them and with Tom Hardy's crazy performance, I was able to go along for the ride Venom's cast features actors and actresses that I wouldn't have pictured being interested in this movie. Tom Hardy is a great actor and I think casting him was a good decision. He brings something to this role and he does as much as he possibly can with this material. My only note is that Eddie as a character seems to act like he's a little younger than Hardy, so he may be a little old for the part. But otherwise, he was one of the best parts of the movie. I really like Riz Ahmed too, he's transitioning to bigger and bigger projects and I've yet to see him in anything where he wasn't a standout (check out The Reluctant Fundamentalist and The Night Of). I think he's miscast here; the character calls for him to be a little more sinister and animated yet he's oddly reserved. He had his moments, he gives a speech to a test subject about the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac that was well delivered but they needed another actor. Michelle Williams rarely appears in blockbuster movies, she does her job capably, but she gets the short end of the stick. Her character is a little generic and aside from one scene, there isn't much for her to do here. I will also credit Jenny Slate who did a solid job in her scenes.The most pronounced criticism that the critics have lobbied against this movie that I can agree with is that the scene transitions in Venom are oddly sloppy. When I say that, I'm not referring to character decisions or to tonal swings (both have their off moments going into the final turn, especially with Eddie/Anne romance) I mean the movie just doesn't flow from scene to scene. There could be pieces missing that fill in the blanks (Tom Hardy's comments about the movie seem to indicate as much) but a good movie compares to an orchestral music piece. Despite so many elements being brought together, there's harmony. Venom lacks that consistency, you'll be wondering how characters arrived in certain places or how time is passing in an uneven way. I usually believe its poor editing, but I thought the fight scenes were cut together surprisingly well. I don't know whether to point the finger at the editor, the studio or the director but they could have done a better job, especially with such a big project.I don't want to make excuses for Venom but the last not I'll make was the movie was fun the whole way through. I never got the impression that the movie was taking itself very seriously (the interplay between Eddie and Venom was a little tongue-in-cheek) and that helped me get on board. Despite this not being a landmark for superhero movies, not every movie in the genre needs to be Infinity War and with the different vibe Venom goes for, there's enough here to keep you happy for the whole picture.Despite the negative word of mouth surrounding Venom leading up to the release, I was rooting for this movie. Walking out of the theatre, I thought of another film Ruben Fleischer directed called Gangster Squad. Similar to Venom, that movie had a lot going for it but tripped up in a couple of key areas (the worst being the horribly hammy dialogue). The character design, the CGI, the action and even the central performance are all good to great here, and I liked the fact that we're getting more anti-heroes instead of boy scout superheroes. But Venom also stumbles over corny dialogue, some miscast actors and actresses and a lack of polish that the top end superhero movies have. I would really like to see a sequel to this, maybe they'd be able to iron out more of the kinks on the second try and go for a little more edge. Venom is a mixed bag, but I think the good outweighs the bad easily and the critics were too harsh on this. I'd give Venom a 7.5/10 but I can't quite go to 8 on it so I must round down. If you're interested, go check it out but if you're not sold, waiting for it to be on your preferred streaming service isn't a bad idea.","10/10"
"Venom","pigointment","3 October 2018","This movie is lit. I loved the part where carnage made a surprise entrance and killed riot. Spiderman was also amazing. It rlly bumbed me when eddie brock dies but they will probably revive him in far from home.","10/10"
"Venom","BrickNash","8 October 2018","This is a highly enjoyable romp with quite a likeable anti-hero. Tom Hardy is both engaging and hilarious as both Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom, and the two and fro between the two characters is what really makes the film work.As a film though, it's fine, but relatively unspectacular. It follows a reasonably generic Marvel-style pattern which guarantees it's head is kept above water, but it also means that there is a little case of ""Seen it before"" happening. The script could be better and the CGI is pretty terrible and looks more like late 90s tier computer images.However the Venom personality, while essentially evil, becomes incredibly endearing towards the end of the film, and as such and ropy effects or script blandness were made redundant, plus I was left hoping for a sequel.If they can get a better script with sharper banter between Brock and Venom and have the film a bit less generic in structure then this could be a fantastic franchise all on its own. No Spider-Man required!All in all, a great start and a very entertaining film which has it where it counts.Recommended!","10/10"
"Venom","bhernandez2216","12 October 2018","Tom Hardy played the best Anti-Hero/Supervillian character Eddie Brock/Venom, of the whole entire MCU, much better than Topher Grace's Venom from Spider-Man 3. Nice work Tom Hardy. Truly nice work.We Are VENOM.","7/10"

"Venom","rgkarim","5 October 2018","Marvel holds many cards in the world of Hollywood, and despite the hope of a united universe, Sony pictures still holds off in giving us a united front for our superhero crew. Tonight, a new contestant enters the park, not so much a hero as an antihero, this creature has pulled in a noble fanbase and inspired a number of other characters in the process. If you've got the hints you know what I'm reviewing, so let's get started as Robbie K reviews: Movie: Venom (2018)Director:
 Ruben Fleischer
Writers:
 Scott Rosenberg (screenplay by), Jeff Pinkner(screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Marcella Bragio 
LIKES: The Dark Aspect: You'll see a lot of jabs at this movie, but this installment at least gave us a taste of the darker side of the titular character. The movie dips into how not everything is gold in the realm of superpowers, as well as how grey everything can really be in the complex world of humans vs. the unknown. It also allowed for some more intense action scenes to come into play, including some finishes the fanbase has been looking forward to for some time. The Action... sort of: There are moments in Venom that feel well at home with MCU level style of battling. Venom has at least two winning sequences for me that have explosions, choreographed take downs of extras, and some sweet utilization of CGI to bring out Venom's fluid, whip like movements to bare. It's not the most dynamic, but it is miles above his first appearance back in Spiderman 3. Sound Editing: Probably not what most are looking for, I enjoyed the sound effects brought by the movie team. You've got the alien slithering, the roiling growls of the hungry beast, plenty of speaker shattering booms, and enough effects to wrap together to make for the action scenes. Tom Hardy: The star of the show and perhaps the best casting call for this movie, Hardy is certainly the leading component of his film. His ability to play an awkward, down on his luck, vigilante reporter is quite spot on, as well as the uncanny ability to play a crazy person as well. It came off naturally, held good chemistry with the rest of the crew, and certainly was entertaining to watch him interact with a digital, altered voice of Venom. I've said it before, but Hardy's ability to play any type of role continues to be present in his acting. Comedy: Like most Marvel movies, Venom is loaded with comedy to get you laughing and ironically may be the biggest aspect of the movie. Both intentionally and unintentionally, the movie had me laughing, primarily at the banter between Venom and Eddie Brock through much of the movie. The insults are on point, the delivery of the lines, and even Venom's questionable morals are all entertaining for this reviewer and probably the biggest point one should go in wanting to see. The End Credits Teaser: Not fully relevant to Venom, the post credit scene is worth the wait and hints at a huge potential for the next Sony-Marvel production coming in December. A little teaser to see if you want to take a trip into that. DISLIKES: The CGI: Still better than anything I could do, Venom didn't quite have the same definition and attention to detail that its Disney infused brothers do. The graphic are a bit messy, for although fluid, looks like living spaghetti trying to take form in many ways. Perhaps an homage to the early 2000s graphic style, Venom needed some upgrading to match the graphic expectations that the movie fans most likely desire. The Story: Hinting and promising so much in the trailer, Venom's story department does hit the dark aspect that this antihero demands. Yet, it still took shortcuts for this film, skipping over a lot of build-up, character development, and even just plot development to get to the goods and comedy I guess. Other characters are very one-dimensional and shallow, relationships are very fickle and seem to switch faster than a light switch, and in many cases crosses into cheesy proportions that didn't work for me. Grandiose displays may be something that younger audiences like,, but the story element still needs some tweaking to get to the Disney level. The Other Symbiotes: I get this was the start of the franchise, but the advertisements really hammered into us the potential to see other creatures more than Venom take some screen time. Sadly, they skimped on these as well, forcing to barely touch on these creatures before moving on to another poor plot point. Even the main antagonist in this film didn't get much time worth warranting, once more digging at the weaker storytelling of this studio. Even Venom took some time getting himself on screen, a sad use of merchandising rights when it could have been so much better. The Anticlimactic Action: Venom does have some nice action scenes as mentioned before, but the problem is that they are often short lived or very carbon copy. The chase scene showed promise, and the first-time combat had its moments, but they utilized their tricks a little too quickly. The ending promised a potential to have a real, epic clash of the Symbiotic titans going, but again Sony cut the corners and left me wanting more to show off their powers. Venom was very underpowered in this film, and they did little to utilize the keys handed to them. The props for the mid-credit scene: Actor choice for the surprise guest at the film is 50:50 to me, but the props to make him come to life... not very good for me. Should a Venom 2 make it to the big screen, I'm hoping their wardrobe department makes some better efforts to get the next antagonist in. The VERDICT: Go in expecting a comedy and you will love this movie and have the most fun. However, in regards to the full picture part of the film, it still has more to develop before it meets expectations set by Disney. Hardy and some mediocre action scenes can bring some entertainment, but it doesn't quite hit the home run outside of that. It's a bit cheesy at times, a little overboard in terms of the comedy, and doesn't quite deliver on the action, other symbiotes or even the story. Yet, it has enough special effects kicks to warrant a theater visit, but only if you can handle the limitations mentioned. My scores are: Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0","9/10"
"Venom","classicsoncall","6 February 2019","I actually enjoyed this one pretty well and I don't know why. It's an average anti super-hero flick, and Venom (Tom Hardy) is every bit as snarly and drooling as his presence suggests on the comic book page. The movie version here bypasses any mention of his earliest association with Spider-Man, so it seems that that will be a sequel for another day. The tone of the story is darker than those of most in the Marvel universe franchise and a welcome break from the ones in which the hero saves the day just in the nick of time. I couldn't help feeling that the mastermind behind the Life Foundation was based on industrialist Elon Musk, who's many irons in the fire make him seem more than erratic at times. Riz Ahmed was somewhat one-dimensional in his portrayal of Carlton Drake, but what would you expect of an egomaniac who didn't mind squandering the lives of impoverished street people to achieve his personal goals?I'm a little conflicted on the character of Eddie Brock, nothing to do with Tom Hardy, but the way in which he's portrayed over the course of the story as that of a loser. Yeah, he lost his job because of his arrogance with Carlton Drake, but the guy had some integrity. However in becoming a host for the symbiote Venom, he's actually turning into a malevolent character with no qualms about taking out neighborhood scum. So it remains to be seen how the Brock/Venom dynamic progresses in the Marvel movie universe.My main regret, now that I've finally seen the picture, is knowing that this is the last film in which we'll get to see a cameo by the great Stan Lee, creator of many of the super-heroes in the Marvel Comics world. Before he passed on, he did get to voice his own cartoon character in the recent 'Spider-Verse' film, but this was his last physical presence in a live action flick. For those not in the know, he was the 'Dapper Dog Walker' near the end of the movie who tells 'both' Eddie/Venom not to give up on Anne (Michelle Williams). Physically he looked great on screen, which makes it all the harder to believe he passed away just a short month after the picture's release.","10/10"
"Venom","Justinpren","13 December 2018","Venom is a really fun movie. There's nothing serious or about the film - it's definitely not designed to portray a deep or meaningful philosophy of life or the vastness of human experience - it's designed to be enjoyable and exciting for people who like to pretend to shoot webs out of their hands or teleport down the street on their way to work or run at super sonic speeds when they're out on their jog. Venom is everything that makes marvel movies and comics what they are. Don't get sucked in by the negative reviews, spend an hour and a half watching Venom, you'll love it.","7/10"

"Venom","jackgdemoss","12 October 2018","PG-13. Comedic tone. Buddy comedy. This was NOT venom. This film is so difficult to give a fair rating. On the one hand, it stood very well on its own two feet. It was funny, well-paced, and had some really good-looking action scenes. On the other hand, it is being marketed as a VENOM movie. Venom is not some goody parasite that is willing to take orders from his host. 
 Most films benefit from tail coating on a brand name character, but this film was severely hindered by it. If you call this movie ""Symbiosis"" and market it as non-marvel, it is an 8/10 solid film for the whole family. I would much prefer a Venom title to be rated R, dark, gritty, and not holding back the punches. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and believe others should see it, but please do not go in with the mindset that you are about to see the Venom you know and love on the big screen.","10/10"
"Venom","yellowmarlin","4 October 2018","This film has no redeeming features. It is not only the worst movie that I've seen so far this year, it is also the worst Marvel movie to date. It is even worse than Fantastic Four and has most in common with Hulk, a comparison that no film ever wants. What Michelle Williams is doing in this steaming pile of garbage I will never know. It gets one star for almost making me smile at one point, and another star out of pity.","9/10"
"Venom","homeflash","29 November 2018","Normally I don't give out 10 .. but this movie is great from start til the end although some plots are expected. (especially at the end)As a normal viewer, your expectation of monster movie will be like the monster is a bad guy.However, this movie is really coming out of the norm. The monster looking like alien is actually a hero at the end and it was a loser. And it matches his partner on earth which is also a loser. So what do you get when you get two losers, double negative makes it positive. A hero therefore is born.Nice CGI, good story.This movie also has some fun dialogue and I enjoyed it very much. I think it is way better than all the spider man movies.I recommend this movie very much.I think the theme of the story should be. Scary is not from outside, it is from inside. Hero does not have a look. Do not judge a book by its cover.","9/10"

"Venom","iamkamile","4 October 2018","I watched this movie knowing the horrible reviews, so I kept waiting for any screw up moments, but I won't say I found lots of it. I mean sure, the CGI could be better, especially in the final fight between Venom and Riot, also R rating would make this movie even better, but it didn't change the fact that the movie is fun! The interaction between Brock and Venom was hilarious, and Tom Hardy is just, amazing.So, if you're hesitate to watch because of the horrible reviews, don't, we watch movies to have fun, not to try to find the mistakes the paid reviews says. Have a good life!","10/10"
"Venom","skankbitch","12 January 2019","At the time of writing, this has an IMDB rating of 6.8, while the medicore Ant-Man and the Wasp has 7.1??? I can only assume Michelle Pfieffer absolutely stunning at 60 has upped the ratings of that movie.
This is so much better, with a leading actor than commands the screen rather than a smirking comic actor. Even Stan Lee's role in Venom is more worthy.
Venom is great - go and watch it, pay attention to the roller coaster ride and love it. It's the best super-hero movie we've had in 2018, although Black Panther does run it very close it's not as much fun.","8/10"
"Venom","rustonreviews","7 October 2018","I distinctly remember seeing Venom for the first time in the 90's animated Spider-Man series. I still own the VHS of The Venom Saga, which was the 3 part storyline that introduced the black suit and Venom to the show. Venom quickly became my favourite comic book villain. I wore out the VHS (I still own it for pure nostalgia) and sought out further Venom stories to devour. First appearing at the very end of The Amazing Spider-Man #299 (with #300 being his first full story), Venom immediately became a fan favourite and has since featured in countless classic storylines that have cemented his iconic status in comic book history. Sam Raimi's troublesome (yet over-hated) Spider-Man 3 introduced the first live action Venom to the big screen, with mixed results to say the least. Following the announcement of a stand alone Venom film (without Spider-Man and separate from the MCU), the general response from fans was confusion. Spider-Man plays a crucial role in Venom's origin, so his exclusion from the film felt like a critical step in the wrong direction. Nevertheless, Spider-Man's absence from the film is the very least of its problems. Journalist Eddie Brock (Hardy) has hit rock bottom. Following his investigation into the secret experimental trials taking place within the shady Life Foundation, he swiftly loses both his job as well as his relationship with district attorney Anne Weying (Williams). However, Brock soon finds himself ""bonding"" with an alien symbiote from another world, forging an odd alliance with the alien parasite to become the malevolent beast Venom. Together they must put aside their differences to stop Carlton Drake (Ahmed), the charming yet psychopathic leader of the Life Foundation, who believes he can use the symbiotes to upgrade mankind into a superior species. Venom is a disaster. Nothing in the film works. The script is badly paced with scenes that feel completely rushed and lazily constructed, and the storyline feels painfully underdeveloped. It all feels very first draft, and all sense of character development is sorely lacking. Hardy struggles to convey a solid Eddie Brock and gives a strange and sometimes goofy performance that does the character no justice whatsoever, and Ahmed's Carlton Drake feels disappointingly one dimensional. The motivations behind his villain plans are never made clear, resulting in one of the least interesting comic book villains in some time. A fundamental lack of chemistry between Hardy and Williams weakens the film. I never bought into their relationship and felt as though it added very little, if nothing at all, to the overall storyline. Although Venom himself looks fantastic on screen, it takes too long for him to finally make an appearance. Weirdly, the film introduces a strange ""buddy comedy"" element to Brock's relationship with the symbiote, resulting in some pretty awkward forced humour that feels as though it was injected into the film for the sheer sake of it. Unfortunately, the action sequences are also dull and uninspiring, and even the final battle feels criminally anticlimactic.The bottom line with Venom is that it's boring. It doesn't try to tell a good story, nor is it interested in making a faithful adaptation. Audiences who aren't familiar with Venom or his classic comic book storylines may enjoy the film as dumb popcorn entertainment. For those invested in Venom as a character, don't bother. Venom is a tedious viewing experience that makes me wonder just how they could have got it so catastrophically wrong.","1/10"

Personally I really like(as seen by my score) but it's not the best movie of the year or something. The action sequence are great especially the final battle but the human subplot drags it down a bit. Like maybe another swing at the script would have done good but oh well it's serviceable.

"Venom","SeakDub","13 October 2018","Sony is turning Venom into another Spider-Man trilogy. Story - Boring and average. Certain parts of the movie were entertaining of the least. But most of the time you get emotionless dialogues that kill the vibe. Then on top of that the action scenes that if you blink you miss it parts. Way too much jumping around during the fighting. Looked like a bad CGI blur. Characters - Everyone in this movie was eh. Tom Hardy seemed to do the best job where everyone else was just an emotionless person with a Kristen Stewart face. Its like the movie cancels the good and bad out. Some moments it was cool and made you laugh. Then other parts were boring and wanting it to hurry up and move along. Besides Tom Hardy's character, everyone else you don't remember. And in my opinion, didn't like anyone.Venom - I did not know Venom's backstory much besides that I thought he was a villain and caused havoc. In this movie he was an anti-hero where you feel sorry for and wanted him to win. I was hoping after feeling sorry for the character Eddie Brock that he would turn into a killing machine and just destroy everyone. But no, he still has a heart that only kills the very bad, and that is a maybe. He was a villain in my mind but for all I know he could join the Avengers. I don't care that he is changing into an anti-hero but I was expecting to watch a man become a villain. Not the same ole stuff. Average - This movie is just average. I feel like I liked parts and other parts I didn't. At this point with all these superhero movies I was hoping for a different turn with a villain movie. But it ended up being just another superhero movie. You seen it once you seen them all. This movie deserves to be rated a 5 or 6 just for how plain it is. I decided to be nice and give it a 6. Judge for yourself but lot of people talking about how awesome this movie is. It is not. A slow build up backstory that has its moments but nowhere as good.All in all the movie could be a skip and you could wait for it to rent. I wouldn't rush this movie and just wait to rent it when you can. I just wished Venom was more villainous. It was suppose to be a different form of superhero movie and what we got was the same thing in a world of superhero movies. Skip theaters and rent it is my call.","10/10"
"Venom","jonnaharkenson","30 May 2022","A solid 8/10 rating. I am not a hardcore comic book guy nor am I one of those nitpicking film critics who criticize films too hard. The film was certainly entertaining and enjoyable, it was not a solid 10/10 rating like you'd expect from 'The Avengers' films but I personally think it's good and the story was creative.I grew up watching Marvel cartoons and collected their toys as a kid. This is a great spin-off film about Venom, which from my memory is supposed to be one of Spider-Man's prominent archenemies... though in this film, he is (or they are) the good guy(s) and not a bad guy.I liked the backstory of the film, and I really liked how the film was shot in San Francisco (they actually filmed on location for some scenes) and it's a nice change from New York City. The buildup and conflicts of the relationships of the characters were good: both the guy Eddie and Venom, and also Eddie and his supposed love interest, Anne (which was played by Michelle Williams whose acting was very good). And there's a good amount of humor between Eddie and Venom, and Tom Hardy who plays Eddie does an amazing job acting as both characters.There's a balance of action, humor, and a slight dark tone (though more action and humor). If anything, you'll at least enjoy the action scenes which were a combination of live action and CGI which looked pretty decent. The fiom is very easy to follow along with, especially if you have zero knowledge of any of the Marvel comics or films, there were no plot holes that I recall.Overall, I recommend this film.","1/10"

"Venom","naviddjalily","4 October 2018","I cannot believe that they messed this movie up. It was a chore to watch. Tom wasn't good in this at all. Was I supposed to laugh? You tell me. This type of movie need to stand on its own. And it doesn't. This should have been an 18 like blade was. I new this film was doomed the moment I see it was in development. I have never ever walked out on a movie. I came so close and almost fell asleep. This just felt like a run-of-the-mill Marvel movie. Thank God my friend works in the cinema and let me in for free. If I had of paid money for this I'd be even more upset than I am. Deadpool did it right. They got him spot on in his first movie and it had great special effects. In Venom, the effects are shoddy and all over the place. Well I'm rambling on so I'll leave it here.","4/10"

"Venom","arogalsky79","20 December 2018","Edge of your seat excitement, believable storyline, perfect mix of action, blood and wit, and you've got Venom! Don't understand what all the hate is for.After the autrocity that was Spider-Man 3, I have been patiently waiting for the redemption of a Venom portrayal that we all deserve. Although I was expecting a typical Spider-Man/Venom stand-off, doing a spin-off was the perfect move for this well-known and well-liked villain/anti-hero. Tom Hardy is, as ever, brilliant in his work and perfect for the choice. Though it might be too bold to say it was as good as Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight good, it just might come pretty dang close. My only complaint was that I felt we didn't spend too much time seeing Venom, and the movie ended somewhat quickly, despite it's running time. Not that it felt rushed or cut off, just that feeling of wanting a little bit more.While several people are pushing for the sequel to be R rated, I can see where they're coming from given the hint of Carnage at the end. However in my opinion, they will do better in the box office if they keep it at a rating adults are comfortable taking their under 17 children to. To me, more blood and violence isn't necessarily better. I would choose a good storyline and good acting over the blood and the gore. It may have worked for Deadpool, but not so much for this character. Alas, I am probably alone in this voice so it probably will be rated R, though I hope not. PG-13 is plenty. I felt this movie had the perfect amount of showing Venom's gruesome side without going completely overboard. I would like to take my boys to it when it when the sequel comes out.","10/10"
"Venom","BandSAboutMovies","28 December 2018","Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad), Venom has appeared on plenty of worst of lists this year. I held back judgment until I saw the movie. I can sum it up in one word: underwhelming. But after all, who was clamoring for a Venom movie after Spider-Man 3? Who was needing one in 2018? And after the magic of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, why do filmmakers feel they can still be so lazy with superheroes?That said, Venom is critic proof. After all, it was a box office success, ultimately earning $855 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.It all comes down to one good thing: Tom Hardy. It's like this dude has to have the craziest voices in movies. His Eddie Brock voice is just the most need to please accent ever, while Venom, in his own words, is a ""James Brown lounge lizard."" The relationship between these two characters -- who become one person -- is the best part of the movie. Hardy also improvised a lot, such as when he jumps into a lobster tank to cool down. I kind of love that the dude was pretty much making up his own film. The actor claimed that he based his performance on Woody Allen, Conor McGregor and Redman.Everything else -- from the villains to Eddie Brock's relationships -- is as generic as it gets. Big points for having Jenny Slate in here, even if she does nothing. It's like the film felt it had to give us an origin when all we want to see is Venom break stuff. The end of the film, where he eats a criminal and meets Cletus ""Carnage"" Kasady (and come on, who doesn't want to watch Woody Harrelson against Hardy in a battle of accents and overacting) is exactly what everyone really wants, not nearly two hours of generic soldiers and Venom battling Elon Musk.In the spin of selling this movie, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch claimed that ""Venom was considered a spin on a horror film, inspired by the works of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, but with more pop and fun."" People that say these kinds of things have never seen films by these two directors. Get their words out of your mouth and make better movies.The hard part of this whole thing is that there's a tease of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which will either make you say, ""I should have just watched that"" or ""Man, that was such a better movie.""","10/10"
"Venom","scotty-27964","8 December 2018","There's some decent acting, some of the cgi is pretty good and the relationship between Eddie and Venom (Hardy acting with Hardy) has some entertaining moments. There's your three stars.
In all other areas this film falls woefully short. In a world where the bar for comic based films is constantly being raised this is a big disappointmen. The storyline manages to be filled with clich√©, and be so simple and predictable and yet have huge plot holes.
-Charming genius millionaire (conveniently) owns space ships and pharmaceutical company, turns out he's bad.
-guy who's down on his luck but still friendly and generous, he's our goody.
the 'but no one will belive us' moment.-building with deadly things in has woeful security, bad thing gets out.
-For some reason this private security company are totally allowed to drive their huge 4x4s, chasing dangerously through the city without a single cop in sight (also they bomb a load of sh*t along the way, but no one seems to mind)
-some drawn out exposition that repeatedly hits the audience over the head with exactly what is happening and drops some serious hints at how it may be resolved.
awww the protagonist.who was bad has changed, he isn't bad!ooohhh millionaire bad guy is still bad!good guy (alien) vs bad guy (alien)good guys win, but for several minutes you think one has died.-He hasn't died, that would ruin the chances of a (very heavily hinted at) sequel.
That's about it. Nothing about it even hints at being risky, inventive or imaginative. From what I've read quite a bit of this film was left on the cutting room floor to bring its rating down from an 18 (R), to widen the audience and leave it open to a Venom / Spidey face of in the future, but unfortunately what is left is something that feels like a rehash of The Incredible Hulk, not the best foundation for a film.Plot holes:The whole symbiotic relationship is a bit muddled, they need the perfect host to live, but also a large test tube will do? Also why do they 'eat' the host if they need them to live?Why does Riot want Venom to return with him?The simbiotes plan to return to their planet and bring back more, why didn't they load the first rocket with more? Why allow the first humans to capture them In the first place? Why not enter the first humans and then load up the first rocket?There are a number more but you get the idea.I know it's just a film, and when it comes to comic book and sci-fi stuff you've got to forgive a few leaps of logic, but for me there's to much to forgive in this film.","8/10"

"Venom","GunnersMate","6 October 2018","As the latest installment in a sea of Marvel characters brought to the screen, the bar is set high and the expectation for cinematic ""awesomeness"" is inevitable. While Venom was not as epic in scale and delivery as those in the same genre that have come before it, it was a fast-paced, visually intensive, funny, and ultimately entertaining two hours of story-telling. Eddie Brock was very human (and ultimately - as this is first and foremost an origin story - very alien) character with plenty of heart to overshadow his faults. Venom's strength lies in the fact that Eddie Brock's interactions with his lady-faire, the various people in his life, and his titular parasitic companion are interesting even without the obligatory bad-guy to fight. Some CGI in the film could have been stronger, but when it works, it works brilliantly; and while there is comic-book predictability to the plot, the story is enjoyable enough that the shortcomings are only a slight distraction to a movie which is ultimately worth a second (or third) watch.","8/10"

How many is too many? When will they run out of these? Probably never.
Fat paychecks lure serious actors to attach themselves to these 2 hour Hollywood cliches.
Tom Hardy is a serious actor who can carry an entire movie ALL BY HIMSELF. See ""Locke"" a 2013 film . It's him in a car. Period. He pulls it off. Not many actors could.
So why did Mr. Hardy sell out? Because the price was right. I don't know who said it but everything is for sale. You just haven't hit the right price.As for the movie itself, it's a comic book based movie like the dozens of others.
Ongoiing testament to Hollywood's lack of creativity and the public's lack of taste and shallowness. I tried to watch it until the creature made an attempt at being funny... I then made an attempt at ending my viewing abruptly.
Only one of these attempts was successful.","8/10"

"Venom","flintridge0503","19 October 2018","I always knew Tom has acting skills when I first saw him on screen as the bad guy in Star Trek Nemesis as Shinzon. He stood out from the crowd and I knew he would get big one day. His portrayal of Brock is spot on and is worth the price of admission just to see it. But you'll also be entertained as well because this was a better than expected movie with good action scenes and the funny relationship between Brock and Venom. I can't express enough how talented Hardy is. It's not easy to keep transforming yourself into different characters and if you see his body of work, he is a different person everytime, and that takes major skills. Tom Cruise is always going to be Tom Cruise playing characters, but Tom Hardy will literally transform into that character, from the habits, to their accents, all the way down to the walk, posture, and stare. He must spend a lot of time studying these characters because he's almost a master chameleon of sorts. But enough about the talented Mr. Hardy. Go out and treat yourself to this great movie.","7/10"
"Venom","pjgowtham","28 December 2018","I was a bit skeptical before watching this movie. The ratings weren't like the other marvel movies. But this movie has a true potential. The dark humour was the highlight of the show. It was scary and comical at the same time. It's definitely hard for movie creators to pull that off.The writing was well thought and scientific. It does differ so much from spider man's version of venom. Eddie Brock's character pairs well with venom's making them an effective pair. Most marvel movies are just superpower and action oriented. But this movie had the best balance of story, psychology and action.Absolutely loved it.","3/10"

But it went over that and here I am giving it a 9 (more like 8.5 but I rounded it up because it deserves it)While the story itself was not outstanding, the execution was fun and kept me engaged, and that is for me the most important aspect in a movie. Character relationships worked, and the jokes were well placed.Oh, and that kiss!! Omg that kiss! I loved it.The only thing that ever bothered me was that the image quality felt outdated, but I got used to it after 15 minutes in. Then there were the symbiotes, which didn't really blend well with their surroundings.All in all, this is one of my favorite movies of the year. It managed to be gritty when it needed to, and funny when it meant relief. Also, the action sequences were, in a good way, over the top fun.I loved it.","10/10"
"Venom","daviddilligaf","3 October 2018","This is a genuinely good movie which has been unfairly panned by critics. I went in expecting another Suicide Squad mess, but 90% of the movie was thoroughly enjoyable.Is it perfect and Oscar worthy? Of course not, it's a Venom movie. What it is, is a good fun time.To start with, the trailer completely misses the tone of the movie. This is a dark buddy comedy and you should know that going in.There's bad CGI, a forgettable villain and an anticlimactic final act. These are all true. However, if you want a funny, character driven origin story, this will be for you.Hardy gives one of my favourite of his performances; you can tell he had so much fun playing the role and his two characters (Brock and Venom) bounce off each other so well.Think of a very ""aware of itself"" Venom story with clear influences from both Deadpool and your favourite buddy cop movie, with a dark twist, and that's what you're getting. I genuinely did have a lot of fun seeing this movie and feel that you should avoid as many reviews as possible so you can go in with an open mind.

"Venom","Tradniam","4 October 2018","I don't see enough things to believe this movie deserves the word of succesfull solo filming Spider-Man's famous nemesis. 
Venom is so light and predictable. 100% remaking of Spider-Man's origin plot. No surprise at all.
Hardy is so bright on his dark appearance. It is not in MCU yet, is it? Keep off the fun, what they should have done. I remember first look of Venom shows Hardy was in agony scene. But last night Brock was totally fine, cute and healthy. Brock is not desperate enough to have no choice but accepting cooperation with the alien symbiote. I don't know if producer has few parts cut down, because I lost the moment of thrill I have been thinking about this Venom since its first trailer.
Everything is mediocre here.
I believe Venom's CGI should have been better than Spider-Man's.
I believe Brock should have been darker.
I believe Drake's hitmen should have been meaner and more sophisticated.
I believe director should have brought totally new stuffs. I see Hardy as the way he is, he acts, walks, talks. And Riz Ahmed, start knowing him as he stars many good films. Same as Hardy. He doesn't improvise enough to be a villain. Exactly same gesture and look as his other movies. Why not learning from Irfan Khan. We can see he is totally altering for each of his role.","4/10"

That said, it definitely pushes the limits for a PG-13 movie. Also, more humor than I expected as well ( which I enjoyed :) my oldest kid only gave it three out of 10 stars because he wanted it to be darker and harsher ( so, if that's what you're looking for, maybe you're not going to enjoy this as much as I did )","6/10"

"Venom","jboothmillard","15 October 2018","There have been a couple of anti-superhero movies before, where a villain or anti-hero is the lead, including Catwoman and Suicide Squad, the well-known Marvel character, enemy of Spider-Man, previously appeared in the not so good Spider-Man 3, this was his first solo movie, directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad). Basically, a probe belonging to bioengineering corporation Life Foundation has crash landed in Malaysia, after exploring space for new habitable worlds. A comet covered in symbiotic lifeforms was discovered, four samples have been brought back to Earth, one escaped and caused the crash, the other three samples are transported to the Life Foundation research facility in San Francisco. CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) learns that the symbiotes cannot survive without oxygen-breathing hosts, which often reject the symbiosis. Investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) reads a classified document about Drake's human trials, his fianc√©e Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), an attorney involved in preparing a lawsuit defence for Life Foundation, was in possession of this document. Eddie confronts Drake, leading to both Eddie and Anne losing their jobs, Anne breaks off their engagement and ends their relationship. Six months later, Drake is getting closer to achieving successful symbiosis. Eddie is approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate), one of Drake's scientists who disagrees with his methods and wants to help Eddie expose him. She helps Eddie break into the research facility to search for evidence, there he is shocked to find an acquaintance of his, homeless woman Maria (Melora Walters), has become one of Drake's test subjects. Eddie attempts to rescue Maria, but she attacks him and the symbiote possessing her transfers from her body to his, leaving her dead. Eddie escapes, but he soon begins displaying strange symptoms and reaches out to Anne for help, her new boyfriend Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott) examines Eddie and discovers the symbiote. Meanwhile, Drake executes Skirth for her betrayal by exposing her to the remaining captive symbiote, which ultimately dies, this means the symbiote inside Eddie is the only known surviving specimen. Drake sends mercenaries to retrieve Eddie and the symbiote inside him, but it takes over Eddie's body and transforms him into a monstrous creature that fights off the attackers. Taking shelter outside of the city, the symbiote communicates with Eddie and introduces itself as Venom, and it explains that the comet is an invasion force searching for new worlds where the symbiotes can possess and devour the inhabitants. Venom offers to spare Eddie if he helps the symbiotes achieve their goal, and Eddie soon comes to enjoy the superhuman attributes that the symbiote gives him. Eddie breaks into his old workplace to give evidence of Drake's crimes, but a SWAT team surround him on the way out, so Venom transforms him once again to escape. Anne witnesses this transformation and takes Eddie back to Lewis's office, where it is revealed that the symbiote inside of Eddie is slowly rotting his internal organs, Eddie also admits that the symbiote has two weaknesses: high-pitched noises and fire. Although Venom claims the organ damage is a fixable part of their symbiosis, Eddie uses the noise of an MRI machine to weaken the symbiote long enough for Eddie to separate from it, Eddie is then captured by Drake's men. Meanwhile, the fourth symbiote, Riot, has made its way from Malaysia to San Francisco by hopping from body to body, including an EMT (emergency medical technician) (Michelle Lee) from the crash site, an elderly woman (Vickie Eng), and a little girl (Zeva DuVall). Riot bonds with Drake, he agrees to take Riot in a Life Foundation space probe to collect the rest of the symbiotes and bring them to Earth. Anne reluctantly bonds with Venom so they can free Eddie, they are eventually bonded again, Venom states he has been convinced to help protect the Earth from his kind through his interactions with Eddie. The pair attempt to stop Riot and Drake with Anne's help, Venom damages the probe as it takes off, causing it to explode and kill both Riot and Drake, Anne believes Eddie is no longer bonded to Venom after this, and that the symbiote also died in the explosion. However, the Eddie and Venom remain secretly bonded and set out to protect the city by killing criminals, Eddie also returns to journalism, and is invited to interview incarcerated serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson). Also starring Scott Haze as Security Chief Roland Treece, Peggy Lu as Mrs. Chen, Malcolm C. Murray as Lewis Donate, Sope Aluko as Dr. Collins, Wayne P√©re as Dr. Emerson, Bruce Almighty's Emilio Rivera as Lobby Guard Richard and Stan Lee as Dapper Dog Walker. Hardy is likeable as the reporter, and he thrives as the snarly voice of Venom, together they make an amusing twisted buddy duo, Ahmed is a slightly two-dimensional power-hungry scientist villain, and Williams is also a bit simple as the ex-girlfriend. There is no argument, the special effects to create the alien creatures and exciting sequences are brilliant, and there are worthwhile fast-paced chases and fights, but the overall film is a bit of a mess, the story and dialogue is a bit predictable, it shifts awkwardly between tones of tension and thrills, adding near forced humour, and sometimes it doesn't seem to know where to go, a reasonable almost below average superhero fantasy action horror. Okay!","9/10"
"Venom","MiroslavKyuranov","3 October 2018","What the hell are you? Well, the latest Sony ""wanna be great"" Spider related movie, which is not. I mean the main idea to build your own cinematic universe separted from the MCU, without Spider-Man, but with the future plan to cross with him it's kinda too optimistic for Sony. This movie demands to be R-Rated...or not, this is just unnecessary movie. I mean nobody wants it. People want Venom in the MCU with Spidey, not Sony making their own universe.Tom Hardy and the connection with Venom, is the best thing about the movie. There is some action, the story is blunt and there is nothing really special other than action scenes and some humor at the end.I really hope the second one to be a lot better than this. For sure, there're some people, which are not so invested into the comicbook world and will like it as a separated property.One of the credit scenes is good, but it was predictable and I don't know what the future of this universe will be.At the end my score it's still high...","4/10"

"Venom","firefox-68028","4 October 2018","Just to start I want to say my favourite super hero/ villain is venom so I may seem a bit biased but I tried to keep a level head going in and not let the fanboy out.My honest feelings were that the film is exactly what it needed to be. Thank god they didn't pull and amazing Spider-Man 2 and tried to set up a wider universe. Yes there is space too but I believe this film can stand as a stand alone movie.The opening to the point of Eddies first contact to me was really poor in the acting department and the story seemed very messy here however as soon as that symbiote hits it's full steam ahead! Tom hardy has always been an actor that I can really rely on in movies and after seeing legend, (an excellent film which I highly recommend) I had no doubt about his ability to form the two identities of Eddie and venom.The romance sub plot surprised me and I thought it was handled in a way rarely seen in superhero movies so well done on that. A big point of content was the jokes. Yes the ""turd in the wind"" line is a bit cringy but I think a huge amount of the jokes do hit home. For people who have seen the film a certain joke regarding an elevator that was short and sweet and had me genuinely laughing at it. Time to talk about venom himself! CGI on him is how I wanted venom to look in a live action version, that slimy, toothy, grinning look that looks like something straight from the comics.This film will definitely not be for those that aren't really into comics and I think this film may hit a special place in some fans hearts like me. At the end of the day I say go see the movie and see if you feel the same way. Something that I found really helped me was I went in not thinking of the MCU at large and Spider-Man at all and only when I was 1 hour in did I think ""I haven't thought about Spider-Man once!""To me venom is a surprisingly good film with some great action, visuals and comedy that occasionally stumbles, especially the clunky opening 30 minutes","3/10"

The plot of this film was like a bad TV pilot. The film was just 2 hours of cringe . How are Venom fans not disappointed by this film? It doesn't do justice toward the character because it's bodged down with some of the most lazy writing I have ever seen . I usually disagree with the critics toward Superhero movies but this time I have to side with them. My friends and I made fun of this piece of crap during and after the movie. This film also would've benefited a tiny bit with an R rating but a complete rewrite of the film would have helped it the most. The editing was really choppy and the first 15 minutes are embarrassing. It's one of the worst superhero films I've ever watched. I wasn't even expecting much and I was disappointed. I really regret seeing this in theaters because the more money this makes the more Sony is going to put out garbage content like this. Heck I saw this on a matinee and I feel cheated. I could have bought a $5 blu-ray and watched something good with my friends. I could have rented a movie for $3 and bought off brand soda. But I made a bad decision by going to this film and handing the man on the counter $5. I'm never gonna see my money again because Venom consumed it and my stupid brain let it happen.","4/10"

I was going wait for the dvd like I do to all films that look like grabage but due to circumstances I saw it in theaters and it wasn't BAD. And it wasn't near good. Its just an okay bad movie that doesn't need to be seen again.The main problem is the pacing. The pacing was too fast. There is no build up, some scenes just happen for the sake of happening and lack of better character development.The acting was fine.Like most films they always have that annoying lead female character. This film is no different. The Lead Female has a couple moments where you want her to just die.CGI was meh.Overall the only good thing about the movie is the mid credit scene.","8/10"

"Venom","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","31 October 2018","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEddie Brock (Tom Hardy) makes a living doing online videos, attempting to expose big scandals. In his latest video, he has tangled with Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of a bio-engineering firm that has been involved in a number of controversial events, costing him his job and his fianc√©. Drake has secretly got hold of a bizarre, shape shifting mutagen, and after breaking into his laboratory, Eddie unwittingly becomes its host, transforming him into the crime fighting gargoyle Venom.There's nothing like an adult orientated comic book adaptation, not least because it excludes the auditorium you're watching it in from any noisy, rambunctious kids, as well as just generally providing a more rounded, uncensored experience. They tend to be more obscure, little known creations that just have their own little cult following among their devotees, and no parents will be pestered by their offspring to take them along to see it, having never heard of it. These have ranked among some of my favourites, such as Deadpool 1 and 2 and The Punisher films (no matter what anyone says!) but Venom sadly falls short of this mark, while doing nothing aesthetically wrong, it's just too mechanical and ineffective to be one you'd want to see again.The first big disappointment is that, in spite of the 15 certificate, there doesn't seem to be anything more edgy than in your average Spiderman film, despite some rocky language. The host character, played charismatically by a wise-cracking Hardy, takes up much of the first half of the film, but the titular character takes too long to make his presence felt, and despite being physically impressive, with a seriously scary face, sounds too much like The Honey Monster from the Sugar Puffs ads. The action is shot too close up, with too many quick cuts and, even being an action film, is too loud. All the dialogue feels stilted and staged, and none of it sounds real or convincing. The wafer thin plot isn't strong enough to hold everything together throughout the course. Meanwhile, Ahmed is too weedy and nerdy to be taken seriously as the villain.It subtly borrows little pieces of other films, from more adult fare like Predator, to kids films like Super Mario Brothers, without having any kind of solid structure to stand as a film on its own. It's all rounded off with the title track from Eminem, who's gone from making personal, deep raps about his life to doing the soundtrack to superhero movies. I've just found out the character was created by that Todd McFarlane guy, the same guy behind Spawn, which this reminded me so much of. The film version of that was absolutely savaged by critics when it came out, but I loved it. This, sadly, doesn't hold up, but you just know there'll be an inevitable sequel that'll be even worse. **","8/10"

"Venom","thesupershadow","6 October 2021","VENOM - my review: Overall, I think it's one of the best anti-hero films to be released, this even despite being a separate version from the 'cannon' spider-man series/character. It follows a not too confusing and linear pace, but at the same time doesn't feel too rushed and allows for some really intimate and engaging acting unlike - Avengers: infinity war...Let me assure you, the curse of spider-man 3 has been broken! Venom can work as a violent yet funny character similar to deadpool, the CGI is incredible, the humour and script is well-written, there's even hints of Alien-film soundtrack and the famous French horn sound used as the theme for Venom in Spider-man 3 makes a return.This film could've turned out much, much worse. Don't trust those bad reviews based on other repetitive Marvel films, look at the winning financial viewing results, or better yet watch it yourself and decide. Tom Hardy has done this role JUSTICE!","10/10"

"Venom","PradoCedric","25 October 2018","This is definitely the most disappointing and one of the worst superhero film since Batman & Robin, Catwoman, Fant4stic, and Suicide Squad. There are so things that get this film wrong and right.For the wrong, the tone is completely inconsistent and all over the place. The film desperately tries to be gritty but turns to be a joke, and its attempt to blend in with sci-fi, superhero, and horror genres makes it convoluted and had a hard time seeking its identity. Even the CGI, editing, and pacing is laughably bad. The worst offender here had to be the script. From its clunky, bland and nonsensical plot to its terrible lines, dialogue and one-liners, it clearly shows the film's banality as well its toxic and venomous conditions.Even the most charismatic and respectable actors are wasted in this film. Riz Ahmed is horrendously miscast, and combined with his hammy, stale and mediocre acting. The fantastic Michelle Williams is given no favors despite her very best in giving her performance of Anne Weying with depth and conviction but ultimately falls flat and is even forced to deliver a weak dialogue and acting.On the other hand, here's what the film got right. Tom Hardy makes an excellent performance as Eddie Brock/Venom, which at least redeem its Venom portrayal from the horrendous Topher Grace performance of Venom in the terrible Spiderman 3. The dynamic and chemistry between Eddie Brock and Venom along with Hardy's performance are the only of the film's saving graces, but it's not enough to redeem this cyanide trainwreck.The most disappointing of the film itself is the PG-13 rating, which effectively weakens the quality overall and even restrains its character development from going to its darker characteristics, which this film could have gone better with an R rating, considering the success of rated R superhero films such as the Deadpool films and Logan. Still, this is not the worthy adaptation that Venom character is truly deserves to and even the performance of Hardy as well its dynamic deserved better than this misfire.","10/10"

"Venom","drmargis","23 May 2023","When I heard Sony was making a Venom movie without Spider-Man, I was not on board. It was such an obvious cash grab to hold onto an IP it was struggling with, and that's ignoring that Venom without Spider-Man just doesn't make sense. So I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.But not.that pleasantly. I get the strong positive fan response but can't agree that strongly since the movie has some glaring problems that pile up as the movie goes on. I don't dislike it, and even enjoyed much of it, but overall left disappointed.'Venom' follows journalist Eddie Brock, a selfish and arrogant but not awful guy, who winds up ruining his career and losing his girlfriend when he uses privileged information to go after a tech tycoon. Said tycoon turns out to be performing deadly tests on humans with an alien creature that can bond with other life forms, usually imperfectly. When Eddie tries to find real evidence of this, he winds up bonded with the alien and you get your Venom.I don't mind that the story diverges drastically from the source material. There's a lot about this movie I did enjoy. Tom Hardy is good as Eddie Brock and is able to sell him as kind of a jerk but overall a decent guy, just with a lot of ego. The rest of the cast is otherwise forgettable, with only Jenny Slate bringing a fine performance. The action sequences are frantic and exciting, so no complaints from me on that. And the special effects mostly worked.The biggest problem is the script and the pacing. The movie spends way too much time at the start dwelling on Eddie's decent from successful journalist to single, jobless loser. The relationship between Eddie and Anne just isn't interesting enough. A better script could have accomplished the same thing in far less time and more effectively. The inciting incident of Eddie losing his job and them breaking up works, but the movie struggles after that to get to the real plot. The movie does shine when the focus is on Eddie and Venom, but it comes too late and is poorly developed, even if it is engaging at times.The second problem is that there are some great moments that would have been very effective pay offs, except the movie does almost no work to earn them. When Eddie is told the Symbiote is killing him, he acts angry and hurt, asking ""What happened to us?"" Except there is almost no attempt to sell that the two are building a trusting relationship. When Eddie later asks Venom what changed his mind about invading the Earth, Venom says, ""You did."" Except aside from a brief scene of Venom musing that the city looks pretty nice, there is no other development of this change of heart. This is a shame, since the movie otherwise does a good job with the Eddie/Venom combo, it just doesn't work to develop it in any meaningful way. The whole movie just screams that the script needed a few re-writes to tighten it up and give it a real structure and build up the characters.There are plenty of logical problems. How the symbiotes bond with people is poorly explained. The movie implies Anne willingly bonded temporarily with Venom to rescue Eddie, but the last scene we just saw her in moments before she was convinced she had to get Venom as far from Eddie as possible. Riot is described as having unimaginable powers by Venom and they have little chance of beating him, but when they do fight it turns out Riot is just... a little bigger and a little stronger, but otherwise it was a fair match. We could even argue the ending where the hero fights an evil version of himself is the most common cliche seen in almost every other comic book movie (Superman II, Superman III, Superman IV, Man of Steel, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Ant Man, Black Panther) But these are minor, and I'd say the movie handles them as well as any super hero movie. The real problem is the writing and how poorly the characters were handled.I went in not thinking I would like it at all and wound up moderately enjoying myself. I just wish the movie had done a better job. I'm not saying don't see it like a lot of critics, but I am saying don't get your hopes too high. Not a bad way to spend two hours but I can't help thinking how with a little bit of effort they could have had a great movie, and instead are left something mediocre and only sometimes entertaining.","10/10"

"Venom","trudyjgrant","7 October 2019","As a life long comic book fan and a fan of Tom Hardy I've been looking forward to this from day one and it was worth the wait.The story line is your standard superhero story but is cool how they do it, it's well paced and works really well with the movie.The best thing for me was the interaction between Eddie Brock and Venom, it has enough humor to tick a box without being a comedy. The conversation between Eddie and Venom work perfectly and stay true to the comic books.Stunning action scenes, the part with the S.W.A.T team is awesome, the bike chase is very cool and well filmed.
My only bad point was the end fight, it seemed to be over far to fast, I'd of liked to see it padded out a bit more.Great fun action movie that I watched with a huge smile on my face, I can't wait to see it again very soon.","1/10"

"Venom","Coventry","29 June 2021","My 12-year-old son is an avid Marvel/comic book adaptation fanatic, whilst his old man is a diehard horror lover; - so watching this ""Venom"" together is probably the closest we come to a father & son bonding session. With nearly two hours of non-stop digital effects, mass destruction, cool transformations and plenty of action, my son had a jolly good time. Me, being an old-fashioned guy and a hater of computerized playgrounds, had quite many eye-rolling moments throughout the film. Still, I found ""Venom"" much more entertaining than the average installment in the ""Avengers"", ""Spiderman"", ""Thor"" or ""Captain America"" franchises, simply because the pivot character is (initially, at least...) a purely evil and undefeatable extraterrestrial force. I tried to look at ""Venom"" as a traditional type of alien invasion Sci-Fi/horror, with the nasty looking symbiote being reminiscent to the creatures in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or ""The Thing"". Although far superior to human beings, the alien is a parasite and needs a bodily host. The fact that he fires off slick one-liners and develops a conscience is most unfortunate, but commercially inevitable, I guess. Oh well, at least the big, ugly and monstrous creep bites off a couple of heads. I'm always in favor of that.","10/10"

I understand that if you don't like Marvel movies this one isn't going to make you change your mind, even though I thought it was refreshing for a Marvel movie. But why would you watch this genre of movies if it's not your thing? I'm not a particular huge fan of Marvel, even though I watch them all, but I like those kind of movies because it's easy entertainment. Venom might not be a superhero but it's for sure entertaining to watch. Not as funny as Deadpool, but funnier than all the other superhero movies. Tom Hardy has the right character face to play this role. But the most positive point about Venom must be the special effects and CGI's. Those were on top and made this a proper action movie that you will enjoy from the beginning till the end. So just forget about those negative reviews, they just don't have a clue how an enjoyable Marvel movie should be.","2/10"

Tom always plays serious and intimidating characters but in this movie, he is funny as hell especially his interactions with Venom. Now I am a certified Tom Hardy fan. There is no actor out there who can better portray this role. He was born for this role. The movie was a joy to watch, I got sad it finished too soon for me.

"Venom","silverathan","27 April 2023","Venom is a movie that should've been R-Rated, the character on the comic books is a bloody monster, a menacing villain and sometimes an anti-hero, but just sometimes, and even in those times, he keeps his brutality and ferocity. Here, in this movie, the violence has been softened, so what is left to the screenplay are some ""Marvel kind jokes"".Somehow, one or another are good, but they're not enough to fullfil the plot. Having a Venom without the Spider-Man It's a bad idea, but It can be sustainable, unfortunately It's not the case here.Even having good acting scenes with Hardy and Michelle, the storytelling is too goofy and childish, the sensation is that you're watching a comedy movie.The action is cool and the photography is okay.

Deadpool proved without a shadow of a doubt that an R rated super/antihero movie will fill seats and studio wallets, yet for some insane reason they went with trying to make it kiddie-friendly. It didn't work. Everything just feels held back, as if you're actually just watching a really long preview. Venom needs to be unleashed, and you just can't do it when he's on the same shelf as Toy Story.","3/10"
"Venom","brandongooner","3 October 2018","Don't listen to the critics they don't know what they are talking about this film was great.

"Venom","jovanan90","20 October 2018","Sooo I'm actually really surprised of how much I liked this movie, it was so, good, so don't believe too much these bad reviews and go see it for yourself.. Tom was excellent and I liked the bond that he developed with his parasite üòÅ. I almost never have a desire to watch movie again, but I would watch this over and over again and I would be entertained every time like the first time.. The only thing that I personally didn't like was the lead actress, she was just plane for some reason, it kinda looked to me that her face is full of fillers so she couldn't do much with her face expressions, other than that for me it's a 10 and big recommendations.","10/10"

"Venom","olkan_gndgu1996","24 March 2020","Movie is terrible. I can say many reasons. I read almost all the Symbiote comics about Carnage,Venom and other symbiote characters. And this is seriously not Venom. Venom is not jocular character. Carnage is the jocular character but mainly he doing psychopath jokes. And in this movie Venom is boring and doing too much joke.. I seriously suprised and said ''What the hell is this?'' First of all movie starts too quickly. Everything happens too quickly and skipping everything too fast. Last battle was a joke. I don't know why people like it. They was just dancing and skipping everything. There is no detail. Riot's death is the biggest joke. I don't like it. I don't care anyone say. Mostly kids like the movie. This is not Venom.","10/10"
"Venom","bfml-03018","14 January 2019","Venom is a movie to dark (art style) with a bad action and the last fight is a cgi mess. The movie lacks plot direction and characters changes,evolution and depth are more then scarce.
The cgi is good for a low budget, the soundtrack is good and venom and eddie relationship is awesome.
Really sad seeing how this made more money them guardians of the galaxy 1/2, deadpool 1 and 2 and others good action movies...","9/10"

"Venom","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","22 October 2018","Venom's a beautifully bad movie that's all-out in its over-the-top nature and its overly oddball Tom Hardy. This movie exists purely as an overdue tie-in to 2007's Spider-Man 3: and boy does this ever show in the film's mid-2000s-inspired Hollywood aesthetics. It's got the hallmarks of a non-MARVEL Studios MARVEL film: stingy references related to the ONE central character in the movie due to rights issues and building up to sequels before even telling the story at hand.This film is an eccentrically empty action-adventure that's trying to tie-in with the modern superhero film craze taking the world by storm. Unfortunately, Venom isn't a very strong example of the genre's strengths: it's a movie made because 'it-had-to-be-done' for Sony (mind you it's not nearly as ATROCIOUS Fox's/Constantin Films' Fant4stic!). Venom's cynical but dumb fun, average story filled with 'ballsy' action sequences guaranteed to make fans of the character proud, but there's not a hell of a lot else to discover in this film.Venom gets 2.5/5 turds in the wind.","10/10"
"Venom","mvinogradsky","17 October 2018","This was a great movie in my experience. I didn't know what to expect when I walked in the theater and sat down. I never seen any shows or movies with Venom or know much about what I was going to see. But as the movie went along it quickly grabbed my attention. I loved how the plot was set up and there wasn't any time during the movie that lost the audience attention which is very important when making a film. The movie consisted of different camera angels such as bird eye view, close up, mid range, etc. which is key when showing action scenes and car chasing scenes. Eddie the main character in the movie is a casual regular guy that didn't have a lot going on (when he became Venom) which I think is pretty cool because most super hero movies the hero is usually a popular guy or someone wealthy. But In this film Eddie an ordinary guy which captivated the audience more in my opinion because people can relate more to it. I highly recommend this movie to someone who hasn't seen it unless you don't like action movies or a Nun. Michael Vinogradsky","3/10"
"Venom","ddanapetrovici","9 October 2018","I honestly don't get the critics, the score does not coincide with the experience that Venom offers us. Is it a strategy to draw more attention to it? Who knows! But I am pretty sure that's the case... I've seen worse movies who had at least 50 points from them.Still, it's not the best Marvel movie out there, with Black Panther being the best and probably the greatest surprise that MCU has ever given to us, but it was enjoyable and I was really impressed with the portrayal of Venom, considering the storyline in the comic books. SPOILER ALERT: there's a lot of schizophrenia in this one :))","9/10"
"Venom","Bulldog1721","8 October 2018","Columbia's use of marvel studios really took me by surprise when this movie came in with unexpected anticipation. The movies overall theming was too good and really epic for the young adults in the audience!I knocked off a star b/c of the use of foul Language spread throughout the movie. If you ask me, This is not really considered a child friendly movie! But other than that, the effects were amazing especially in 3D!!!!Heed my advise, if you have the extra money in the piggy bank lying around, go see this movie in 3-D or IMAX 3-D it's well worth it!The cast of the movie was just phenomenal and Venoms backstory really came to life and I couldn't asked for anything better.If you have little kids and they want a superhero, I suggest wait for Spider-man into the spider verse to come out before bringing the little ones! This movie is aimed toward the young adults and older adults!But overall, Great movie and well worth the wait!!!!","8/10"
"Venom","evan-pahl","30 October 2020","Most professional critics didn't like this film but casual movie fans loved it. Venom as a character gets a second chance after getting entirely misrepresented in Spiderman 3 (2007) and gets it done in a way that can only be described as metal; the tone totally flipped the script and took the audience by surprise the moment Tom Hardy climbed into the lobster tank, letting you know exactly what kind of movie they were going to give you.
However, Michelle Williams' parts seemed like they were off-beat and held no weight for the plot or tone trying to conveyed. Marvel also tends to have a pattern of making the villain nothing much more than a evil, bigger mirror version of the hero; Sony fell for that same trap with this film, but only to showcase that power of the symbiotes as characters withing the universe, as Sony is seemingly trying to cash in on their own Spider-Villian-verse; understanding that much helps the viewer sit back and enjoy the CGI spectical of the film, which is pretty great considering it is a lot of very well done CGI. Overall this was a funny action movie for a popular Spiderman villian/antihero film that already has a sequel in the works. Expect big things from Sony after this film.","9/10"
"Venom","pez-castilla","21 October 2018","Went in expecting one thing and was delightfully surprised by how weird and funny this movie actually is.
I won't go into the cgi, fight sequence, or source material because these things aren't really what mattered to me; I am the wife to a man who wanted to check this movie out, and someone who enjoys the mcu movies: this movie just annihilated all my expectations and I loved every minute of it. Props to Hardy and Williams, especially, for great performances. Hardy brings an unexpected amount of humor into his role and Williams manages to elevate the usual gf role. I appreciate that this movie is so different, tonally, than other super hero movies.","7/10"
"Venom","hotrobinproductions","10 April 2019","To be honest I wanted to see what the audience saw that critics didn't. And I went into this movie expecting it. This film is so boring bland and uninventive. Definitely would have appealed more possibly maybe 10 years ago, back to when the genre wasn't overly saturated and well known. But no, even then this films script is god awful and so bad. One of the worst scripts written of 2018, surprising enough the same writer wrote the script for aquaman which was a film that I overall enjoyed but the script was my biggest issue and of course it had to be the same person. The only thing this movie has going for itself is the performance by Tom Hardy, he steals the show with his acting and performance as usual. Everything else was either bad or generic. Even the venom character was so god awful. (I'm not a fan of judging a film so harshly on CGI and I won't do that, in fact I thought it was solid work with the effects department, and it wasn't distracting me from the plot so I'm ok with effects, and if anyone uses that as a reason to bash this film I think it's unfair, if that's that case you should bash older movies back in the 70s for having effects that weren't good) but back to venom, his CGI was great, his character was so terrible, THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE TRANSCENDED THE GENRE TO NEW TERRITORY, think about it VENOM is a VILLAIN not a HERO. Sure I'm familiar with comics and he was a anti hero in some, but this movie missed the mark to create a unique film, this movie is so bland and generic I felt as if I watched it before, the characters are boring the villain is even more boring the CGI final fight was ehh, and the ending is ugh, the action is so repetitive and unnecessary, this movie was god awful and the soundtrack was even worse, this movie is the downfall as compared to Eminem's song for this movie which was probably arguably even more worse and annoying than the film itself. (AND IM A HUGE FAN OF SLIM SHADY) Venom should have been DCs joker. Taking a villain and making a compelling story of the villain landscape, but no they turn him into a forced PG13 freak forced terrible dialogue and a plot so boring and far from original that the only interesting thing this movie has going for itself is the concept of the symbiotic/human relationship which for me gets interesting with Tom hardy and venom
until it gets annoying and the performance by Tom hardy holds this film up. THATS IT. The acting is all around actually good as well, it's just the script that really holds the film so far back and it's the characters around Eddie that make it so boring that I don't even like the characters no matter how good their acting and performance is.Acting 7/10
Script 2/10
Plot 3/10
Screenplay 5/10
Cinematography 4/10
Soundtrack 2/10
Special Effects 7/10
Editing 4/10Overall Venom has its moments to be held and saved nearly by Tom hardy, but the film was shot so blandly the bad script takes over the film very much and the compelling aspect that makes a film unique doesn't even feel like it's there, feels as if the director forced it to be there. This film should have been such indistinguishable and more hah just another generic boring story. Am I saying they can't make a pg13 venom movie? NO, and I think going a anti hero route can be cool, but this movie isn't doing it folks, and I am sure if they went the darker direction into diving into the villain side it would have been much better, but no, Sony wanted that money and these people gave it to them for this garbage film. terrible film 5/10 and that's just being nice","8/10"

"Venom","Slarkshark","14 February 2021","Close enough to the comics that it's respectable. I do prefer the origin including Spider-Man, but I believe they were able to pull it off without him. I would be lying if I didn't want Spider-Man to come into the picture at some point down the road, and hopefully within the MCU.This was definitely an improvement and much better casting than the previous live action Venom in 'Spider-Man 3'. Yes, it would have been better had it been rated R. Venom is just better as a no mercy anti-hero with gory finishes. The CGI looked good I thought and was entertaining as a whole.All around a fairly decent action movie. Nothing too critical about it, but also nothing extraordinary. Great Eminem track to cap it off with. Also, looking forward to Carnage!","5/10"
"Venom","dushchenko","9 October 2018","One of the most awaited premiers in 2018 was reboot of Venom by Marvel. It was released last week and I couldn't wait to watch it. So, I've went to my favourite cinema right away, but decided to finally try 4DX. And the movie is appropriate for it.
I can agree that it was definitely a great experience. The movie is full of action and immersion into it was pretty deep I'd say.
Will be Venom a good creature, or bad one? Will Venom control Eddie Brock by absorbing him, or the last one gonna be in charge? Is Venom a stupid bloodthirsty animal, or is he smart? These are question you have in your head before going to the cinema. The filmmakers tried to keep intrigue as much longer.
I'm a fan of Marvel movies and waited for this one, of course. In general, it's a cool film. Graphics is incredible. Venom and other species there look so real like in any other movie. And there is also my favorite Michelle Williams. But, Tom Hardy was on point as well. It won't be fair, if not to tell that the cast is just amazing.
But, actually that's almost all what I can say about it. If I haven't watched it in 4DX, I suppose that my impression could be even worse, unfortunately. Don't know what the authors did think about, 'coz the plot is so predictable. Why they decided to do it like that? Wonderful graphics, but simple plot. Hmm...
Of course, there is perfect humor like in other Marvel films, but not so much, like in Iron Man, or Deadpool, what you'd expect.
In any case, Venom is a great movie for watching in the cinema exactly 'coz of its marvelous graphics and action. And you'll for sure find something to like it for.","10/10"

The Venom character isn't a total whiff, but Venom's like too big and I personally never knew Venom could attack like Stretch Armstrong with his hands and arms I mean I knew he could be like that but Venom's like Mr. Fantastic is this flick plus virtually every single other side character is bad and the lighting of the movie is God awful too.

"Venom","zardoz-13","17 November 2018","When Robert Downey, Jr.'s tour-de-force performance as irreverent arms manufacturer Tony Stark in ""Iron Man"" (2009) changed the standard-issue superhero genre, and The Marvel Cinematic Universe left the DC Universe wallowing in the dust. First, Paramount and then Disney appropriated the MCU, and DC is still staggering around in a hopeless daze despite their efforts to imitate Marvel. Second, a posse of charismatic Marvel show-stoppers ensued, and characters such as Thor, The Hulk, Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Captain America, Black Panther, and Guardians of the Galaxy followed with great fanfare and success. Although all these heroes were slick, shiny, and sexy, Disney kept them as squeaky clear savory as their PG-13 ratings. Meantime, while DC struggled with the likes of Superman, Batman, and the Justice League, Disney's foremost Marvel studio rival Twentieth Century Fox sent their Marvel superheroes into action. ""The X-Men"" charted a far grittier path with director Bryan Singer, a notorious helmer who could never land a job with the Mouse House, any more than James Gunn will ever do again. Not only are Singer and Gunn originals, but they are also mutants in a sense. The rivalry between Disney and Fox is clear-cut, and Fox isn't as savory as the clowns at Disney. Unexpectedly, Fox shook up the Marvel Cinematic Universe with ""Deadpool,"" and Ryan Reynolds rocketed to fame as the snarky new kid on the block.""Deadpool,"" Reynolds, and Fox plunged recklessly into the rated-R zone, and they turned the MCU upside-down, enough to push the Wolverine epic ""Logan"" into the R-rated territory. Disney reins in their MCU with PG-13 ratings, while Fox has displayed greater flexibility with R-rated efforts. Sony, originally the home for ""Spider-man,"" has launched several other characters. If ""Deadpool"" took superhero sagas to the next level, ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleisher has taken it further with Tom Hardy in ""Venom."" Although ""Venom"" remains in the PG-13 zone, this new character shares more in common with ""Deadpool."" Despite the devastating critical reviews that mauled ""Venom"" in its opening weekend, the latest addition to the MCU soared to the top of the box office in its first week of release and came close to earning its production budget back in the first week.""Venom"" is a whole lot of fun, and Tom Hardy is far from restrained as he shares his body with an alien Symbiote. Tongue-in-cheek adequately epitomizes ""Venom,"" and this mash-up of an investigative reporter with alien pushes the envelope in a different but welcome direction. If you don't love ""Venom,"" then something is seriously wrong with you. The new origins epic about these two, who they are and how they came together is first-rate entertainment with a challenging villain and a hero who doesn't wear a spandex suit. Think of ""Venom"" as the flipside of ""Alien,"" with a sympathetic being from another world joining forces with a human, and you'll have some idea what to expect from this lively escapade that is flippant without being grotesque. Tom Hardy vanishes from sight once Venom takes over his body, which means that Hardy doesn't have to worry about a form-fitting superhero costume. Set in San Francisco, ""Venom"" chronicles the demise of Eddie Brock, an investigative journalist who loses his job when it goes off on a tangent with a billionaire megalomaniac who shoots rocket ships into space since NASA has powered down. Villainous Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed of ""Nightcrawler"") wants to explore the universe on his own terms, and this includes his dream of living on another planet in outer space. Drake's villainy knows no ends, and he is oblivious to the cost of achieving his dream. Literally, this guy has no qualms about doing whatever he wants no matter how illegal it is. One of his missiles brings an alien intelligence to Earth, and Drake wants to abandon the Earth that he believes is on a collision course with extinction. He wants to cohabit with an alien organism, so he can reside elsewhere in the galaxy.Imagine Drake's disgust when the only person that can survive fusion with his space organism is Eddie Brock. Earlier, Drake wielded his clout to get Brock fired from his job as an investigative television journalist. At the time, a na√Øve Eddie didn't realize the extent of Charlton Drake's power. Literally, our protagonist is taken down several notches, loses his job, and worse, his fianc√©e breaks up with him because he took a peek at her confidential files and used information from them to intimidate Drake. No sooner has Eddie been fired than he discovers to his chagrin that his fianc√©e, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams of ""A Thousand Acres"") has canned from her job as an attorney. Eventually, she finds another lover, Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott of ""The Veil""), but she still has feelings for Eddie. One of Carlton Drake's researchers, Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate of ""This Means War"") approaches a reluctant Eddie, who has not only lost Anne, but also had to move into a seamier apartment, about the unethical experiments that Drake is conducting on homeless people. Drake has deluded these poor people, and he confines them to a lab while he watches if they can co-exist with the alien creatures. The attempts repeatedly fail, until Eddie sneaks into Drake's facilities with Dr. Skirth's help and is absorbed by one of those things. Dr. Skirth calls these organisms 'symbiotes,' while Eddie refers to it as a parasite. Before long, Eddie realizes that his body is changing because of 'Venom,' and this creature can assert its power of him. Drake dispatches his henchmen to capture Eddie, and an adrenaline-laced, high speed chase through San Francisco ensues, with our hero performing some incredible acrobatics on a bike. Venom can talk to Eddie, but only Eddie can hear him. ""Venom"" qualifies as an unforgettable superhero epic. The scenes with the pistol-wielding thug who robs a convenience store where Eddie shops are fantastic!","10/10"
"Venom","james_mayer","21 October 2018","I just watched Venom tonight and OMG it was so amazing! A lot of action, intense scenes, and a lot of suspenseful moments. We don't see Venom until a while into the movie, but the build up was totally worth it! There are a few scenes where viewer discretion is advised, but it isn't that bad. There are a few curse words in the film, but nothing too bad. Not that scary at all, there are a few parts in the film where it gets a little intense, but nothing out of the ordinary. Also for those who have not watched the film yet, there is a scene after the credits, and its a pretty important scene. I really loved this movie and everything about it. It was a 10/10 in my opinion. I would definitely recommend for you to go see it. Not too graphic or scary, and not too plain and boring. Please see it because it is amazing!","1/10"
"Venom","oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx","8 October 2018","I guess the major feeling I get watching an MCU (Marvel Comics Universe) movie is, wow once the special effects industry was an auxiliary of the movie industry, now the movie industry is an auxiliary of the special effects industry. But I guess everyone's down with that these days? So I won't preach too hard about it, after all M√©li√®s and his effects kicked it all off and so maybe we're back to the beginning of film, with all it's awkwardness and inappropriateness too.The movie was appealing to me from the poster and the trailer. A normal guy can become Venom, Venom don't take none of the brown stuff, he's gonna kick you ass right out of your face. So yeah a two hour holiday from the tediousness of the social contract.The film actually comes off as a bit of a buddy movie, inseparable parasite and host journalist Eddie Brock spends most of the movie bonding with comic effect. A main failure is that we're meant to believe that macho figurehead and multi-millionaire heartthrob Tom Hardy is playing a ""loser"". As usual with comic book stuff, you end up feeling that the resulting vigilantism is being given a bit more support than it probably should be getting (the effects of vigilantism are usually heartbreakingly stupid and tragic). The villain (I imagine Elon Musk probably didn't see the funny side with this one) and the antihero both basically have the same general activity, they do whatever the hell they want. But you have to get in bed with the devil to defeat the evil people, right? What popularised the ""work with your darkness"" nonsense, Dexter back in 2006? Or Jack Bauer back just after 911?So I enjoyed it, but probably ""needed a shower"" too. And like a chump I'll probably be back for a second serving of ""eyes, lungs"", and ""pancreas"", when they show the sequel.","4/10"
