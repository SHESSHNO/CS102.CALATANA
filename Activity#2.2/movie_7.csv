"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024","Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo.","

"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024","By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out.","

"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024","I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)","

"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024","Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse.","

"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024","After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel.","

"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024","I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful.","

"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024","Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required.","

"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024","Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor.","

"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024","David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment.","

"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024","A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt.","

"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024","The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism.","

"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024","I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time..","

They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question.

"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024","Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day.","

The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees.

"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024","The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter.","

"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024","The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness.","

The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!","

Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun.","

"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate.","

Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat.","

"The Beekeeper","RightOnDaddio","13 January 2024","There is so much to like about this movie.It's got Minnie Driver in it. She's been driving a path to my heart for, yikes, thirty years now.Josh Hutcherson is a villain. And a darn good one.He's likable, funny, stupid and despicable all at once and it is lovely to see.He takes full advantage of his role and the audience in full reaps the benefits.This movie has cinematic testosterone with a capital T squeezed right from the glorious 1980's and butt-kicking with a capital B.They pair together rather nicely as they often do.The kills are plenty and plenty creative.Director David Ayer doing what he always does best.And Jeremy Irons stepping in and classing up the joint.This is a most welcome original theatrical release for January.It's not a comic book movie or a Star Wars movie.It's not a reboot, sequel or prequel.It's Jason Statham doing Jason Statham things.And it is a blast to watch on the big screen.I also highly recommend another Beekeeper film, Ulee's Gold (1997) starring Peter Fonda. It too, is quite buzz worthy.","

"The Beekeeper","Bateman_Reviews","12 January 2024","I was going into this with little to no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that everything in this movie was so satisfying. I felt 0 sympathy for any of the villains or scammers in this movie and it was euphoric to see them get their due reckoning. Of course Jason nails it and makes ever kill and brutal take down very satisfyingOne thing I will say is that the lore behind the Bee Keepers was interesting enough to keep my attention though corny with the hive talk at times it works as world building. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of action movies and likes satisfying conclusions.","

"The Beekeeper","nscoby93","16 January 2024","This will be quick... everything about this film is hilariously bad. The script is bad, the writing is bad, and the dialogue is bad. It was so bad that I couldn't help but feel it was parody of itself because of how serious they took this subject matter.The premise is so laughable in its stupidity. If it wasn't for Statham and the surprisingly amazing action sequences, choreography, and great sound effects, this film would've been a complete waste of time.Jason Statham plays the Beekeeper who is essentially Jason Bourne, John Wick, and Agent 47 levels of badass. Jason Statham, to his credit, makes this whole Beekeeper ""society"" work as he is a sort of agent outside the government that protects society. He is retired now but is forced out to write a wrong against someone who cared for him. At it's core this film is nothing more than a paint by numbers action revenge movie. Unfortunately, it does it all in the most horrendous of ways.Then, if the story wasn't already horrible enough, the ending left my friend and I laughing. It literally, and I am not exaggerating here, just ends the cut to credits is the most erupt ending I've seen in a movie. If this ending is supposed to be set up to a possible sequel, I say NO!This year is not starting so well, but it is only January. This is commonly the slow time when it comes to movie releases. So if you are desperate enough and I mean desperate then maybe you can garner some entertainment from The Beekeeper but expect nothing from the story or characters turn your brain off enjoy your popcorn, your beverage, and good action.IMDb: 3/10

"The Beekeeper","dave-1205","12 January 2024","The film's narrative hinges on outlandish scenarios and unbelievable action, often veering into unintentionally humorous territory due to its sheer absurdity of specific sequences.While films, even those with mature content, can offer immersive experiences, 'The Beekeeper' falls short. Its graphic elements ('18' UK, 'R' US) juxtaposed with its stretched plot create a tonal disconnect that alienates its intended audience, leaving viewers unable to suspend disbelief.While the film delivers the genre's requisite action sequences, the plot struggles to maintain credibility, often indulging in exaggerated scenarios that feel more amateurish than polishedStepping out of a well-crafted movie is like emerging from a captivating dream, your mind buzzing with the story's echoes. Sadly, ""The Beekeeper"" left me thoroughly indifferent.","

"The Beekeeper","leftbanker-1","1 February 2024","Some call this a John Wick rip-off, but it isn't any stupider or make any less sense than that absurd franchise of mindless killing. I just kept hearing the Itchy and Scratchy theme song throughout this kill-fest: they fight and bite, they fight and bite and fight. Fight, fight, fight, bite, bite, bite, The Beekeeper. And were all the people in this unit also bee helpers? What if one of them wanted to have an ant farm? Would that be OK?Seriously, how old should you be before you grow out of these ridiculous combat movies where one man takes on an army? 12? 13 tops. If there is no possibility of a bullet or even a fist striking the hero, then all of the action is devoid of tension. If there is no tension, just fast-forward to the end credits and save yourself a lot of time. The Equalizer, John Wick, and the films of Jason Statham are not entertainment fit for adults.There were some horrific performances and huge casting gaffs in this. Jeremy Irons simply cannot do an American accent. Period. He sounded like he had a speech impediment. The FBI woman was morbidly obese, yet wore a Harvard Track & Field t-shirt. Was that supposed to be ironic?The movie shows why no one should have a gun in their home. More folks die from their own hands than intruders.","

"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024","In the latest Jason Statham venture, 'The Beekeeper,' the film takes an audacious swing at action but ends up missing the mark by a wide margin. The acting is staggeringly subpar, setting Statham on an unintended pedestal that makes him seem Oscar-worthy by comparison. It's as if the casting was deliberately skewed to elevate his performance through the mere juxtaposition of talent-or the lack thereof. The action sequences limp along without the slightest hint of vigor or excitement, the anticipated gore is conspicuously absent, leaving much to be desired for fans of the genre. The punches, both literal and metaphorical, lack any semblance of impact, making each fight scene feel more like a choreographed middle -school dance than a battle. To add insult to injury, the dialogue is so laughably inept that it unwittingly becomes the only source of entertainment, albeit for all the wrong reasons. Leaving audiences wondering what could have been if it had managed to harness even a fraction of its star's renowned kinetic energy.","

"The Beekeeper","cruise01","13 January 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars.The Beekeeper is a pretty good action thriller film that puts Jason Statham back in a action role and at what he does best. This might as well be his version of a John Wick franchise.The plot is following a beekeeper (Jason Statham) after the lady he has been helping dies after being scammed and stolen from everything. He decides to go on the hunt for those that are responsible. Which leads into something more than he expects.Awesome plot which he follows a certain set of guidelines until the system is broken is were he steps in and at full force to stop the threats. The action sequences are awesome. Jason Statham was great. The rest of cast ensemble is good too. David Ayers direction is full of fast paced and action that makes this film worth seeing on the big screen. Sure the dialogue can be a little repetitive with characters explaining a beekeeper and how they are meant to protect the hive which sure is explaining it to the audience of who this character is.Overall, it is one of the most entertaining action films from Jason Statham since the first Transporter films.","

"The Beekeeper","siderite","30 January 2024","I am going to fail this film as being as close to predictable as humanly possible, and still bad. Statham is the new Chuck Norris. He beats everybody up, kills the wicked and stares down the worthy. He is always fast, but compared only to the really slow opponents he has to face. He is always smart, but only compared to the morons stacked up against him. But he's entertaining, unless the story sucks.And boy, does it suck here. Almost every idea put forth is ridiculous and then completely contradicted just a few minutes later. The editing is bad, there is no one even resembling having fun, except maybe Bobby Naderi. It's 100% by the numbers, a movie scam.The FBI characters are completely pointless. The Black female agent is there for quota purposes only, as she starts off as incompetent, rude and cocky and she continues to run things on the basis of her arrogance alone, thus invalidating the entire premise of the film! Or maybe justifying it, I don't know. Jeremy Irons looks the same for decades, I don't know how he does it, but in this film even his character is reluctantly doing his job, reduced from a powerful man to an acting puppet in bad situations. Minnie Driver is in this. She answers phones. That's all she does for like three scenes.Bottom line: Hollywood should have Beekeepers. The only interesting aspect of this movie is that its production seems to parallel almost exactly the plot of the film. Everything but the righteous ending.","

"The Beekeeper","academic-drifter","16 January 2024","The origin of this revenge fantasy isn't hard to imagine. My guess is that the writer (whose track record in recent years consists largely of writing scripts for completely unnecessary remakes of great action films) was persuaded to give money to a Nigerian prince or invest in NFTs, and decided to get payback by making them the villains of an action piece. Only having Jason Statham beat up a bunch of crypto bros seemed like an unequal contest, so he needed to up the stakes - with extreme prejudice.Thus we get a film in which a bunch of suspiciously well-organized scammers clean a sweet old lady (played by Mrs. Huxtable herself, so you know she's pure goodness) out of her life's savings. Unbeknownst to them, she rents out her barn to a beekeeper who decides to take revenge. Only he's not just a beekeeper, but a retired ""Beekeeper"", a former member of an ultra-secret elite extralegal organization created to maintain ""balance in the system"" by any means necessary, provided those means are violent ones. What could possibly be wrong with that?And with one phone call to his former employer, ex-Beekeeper Statham (his character has some typically generic name that is utterly unmemorable) gets needed information that federal law enforcement has been unable to obtain for years. And with it he begins to work his way up the chain to the very top, brushing aside with casual indifference challenges that would stymie anyone else. Armed thugs, SWAT teams, and ex-Special Forces operative are shrugged off with just a few moves. Injuries that would immobilize or even kill lesser people are mere annoyances to him, handled with a grunt and an application of a piece of cloth to some random part of his body. T-800s would envy such durability.More concerning is the recurring condition from which Beekeeper Statham has suffered that has caused him to internalize both his title and his pastime, to the point where every conversation with him degenerates into a series of beekeeping metaphors. Evidently this is a viral illness, as others he comes into contact with or who even learn of his existence soon spout the same inane analogies. With it comes a sort of resigned acceptance that all this murder and property destruction is necessary to protect ""the hive."" At this point Mrs. Huxtable has been forgotten five crimes scenes ago save by her daughter, who happens to be an FBI agent and who manages to figure out everything with the help of a beekeeping manual. Yes, it's like that.To be fair, if you like this sort of thing it's not the worst movie in the world. The ""system"" is saved, bad guys get their just desserts, and Beekeeper Statham lives to beekeep in the sequel (if any of this constitutes a spoiler to you, welcome to action films). The greatest crime on display in it, though, isn't the scamming or the murder or the property destruction, but the utter waste of acting talent, as several award-winning thespians are asked to do little more than deliver their lines on the way to cashing their checks. The only one who really threatens to run away with the movie is Josh Hutcherson, who plays a classier version of Donald Trump Junior with a degree of panache that threatens to make the movie fun. But then David Ayer's questionable camera angles and his need to showcase Statham's evident case of facial paralysis intervene to ensure that he does not prove to be the true hero of the movie by saving it from the tedium of predictability. But hey, at least scammers will think twice about scamming lest a Beekeeper gets them, right?","

"The Beekeeper","rehmankhilji","4 February 2024","Upon encountering the name David Ayer as the director, alongside Jason Statham in a production bearing a promising title, I anticipated a satisfying full on action movie experience. However, akin to the recurrent pattern observed in Statham's previous films, this one, albeit marginally superior, failed to meet expectations.Initially, the director presents a character engaged in beekeeping, yet the portrayal lacks authenticity by sparing only a meager 100 bees and possessing a minimal number of hives, if not fewer than a dozen.The film's execution is notably deficient across numerous scenes, prompting a sense of incredulity and frustration. Numerous lapses in coherence and logic pervade the narrative, leaving the viewer bewildered and questioning the purpose of the cinematic endeavor.The prevalence of clumsy mistakes becomes evident within the initial minutes, rendering the movie entirely nonsensical in its unfolding. Emmy Raver-Lampman's casting in a particular role remains questionable, lacking a discernible rationale.In summation, refraining from viewing this production does not entail a significant loss, as it fails to deliver any substantial content of note.","

The plot follows a retired special agent who tends to a bee colony and shares moments with his aging yet appreciative neighbor. However, when his neighbor falls victim to a scam, he unleashes hell in retaliation.Directed by David Ayer (Suicide Squad), the film features Jason Statham (Crank), Emmy Raver-Lampman (The Umbrella Academy), Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Jeremy Irons (Dead Ringers), and Phylicia Rashad (The Cosby Show).This movie is a chaotic mess. The acting and dialogue are horrendous and had a made-for-television vibe. It's a ""shut your brain off"" experience with over-the-top action scenes, some intentionally hilarious, and others so bad that they become amusing. The action choreography blends fights, knives, and gore brilliantly. The shootouts are fun. The bridge scene was excellent, ""unlucky"" conversation hilarious, the gas station sequence was wild and the brass knuckles fight cracked me up. There was some entertaining scene. Even Jeremy Irons seems awkward and out of place.In conclusion, The Beekeeper caters to action junkies. This has some John Wick, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme vibes.

I seriously don't know how they pick these actors and writers but they deliver the worst material thanks to horrible writing and cringy people. By the way, I'm an action fan and ""mindless action"" is great most of the time as long as it's done right. This is just a John Wick wannabe B movie diguised as an A class thanks to its budget (probably above the average).There is not much to say about Statham, he's doing some of his usual stuff again except he can't bend, jump or do his moves on the floor due to his age. As for the rest of the crew, that FBI lady is in the center of ""feel bad"". I mean useless nosey female law person is a cliche older than me already but her appearance, attitude and style couldn't be cringier than this, zero credibility. At least try to find some actor looks like a government agent for god sake. Her only contribution to the story is to help bringing more people to get wasted by Statham. As for Jeremy Irons, clearly he needed money, maybe that's understable at some extent. I won't even go into other cartoonish villains. Very bad copies of John Wick universe characters.Long story short just stay away from this one. This is not John Wick, Nobody or even Extraction.","

In align with that, it's worth mentioning limited acting, a terrible script and zero cinematographic intentions to make a good movie. Please keep Jason Statham away from the cameras for the upcoming years until he's retired unless he decides to compromise with his job. On the other hand, Jeremy Irons: shame on you for accepting being part of such a stupid story. I guess the writers were trying to create a mediocre copy of Jonh Wick, but without giving it too much thought. Finally, let's not allow that Emmy Raver-Lampman work in a film again, or, is the script to blame for her total unrealistic performance?

"The Beekeeper","isaacsundaralingam","19 January 2024","David Ayer's 'The Beekeeper' might be good enough to make a convincingly fun trailer, but this Statham led action flick ends up being nothing more than a poorly written John Wick wannabe.Here we have Jason Statham playing Jason Statham as a beekeeper - an actual beekeeper but also a retired special agent part of an underground government program called (you guessed it) The Beekeepers. When his elderly neighbor, whom Statham repeatedly reminds us to be ""the only person who ever took care of (him)"", kills herself after losing her life savings in a phishing scam, he seeks revenge on her behalf, killing his way up the ladder of scammers towards whoever was responsible.'The Beekeeper' is written to be a very John Wick-esque action movie, with similar tropes and motivations, but with none of the smarts and the compelling that made the Wick movies so great. We have some bland characters spewing a bunch of off-the-script exposition at every opportunity, an underground system that's entirely uninteresting, some annoyingly corny bee trivia and worst of all, not a single satisfactory revenge moment. It's a revenge movie but the whole movie is just a repeated ""Wait, is that it?""... EVERY SINGLE REVENGE SCENE... ""Wait, is that it?""The action scenes were passable, sure, and the movie is definitely not boring, but at the end of the day, it's not worth your time. You might be inclined to say that it's just a mindless action movie and that I'm being a bit too harsh, and sure, maybe, but should I really not expect even the tiniest amount of logic and creativity in a movie that I'm supposed to be entertained by?","

"The Beekeeper","OnlyMigsR8TINZ","5 March 2024","""The Beekeeper"" Movie Review!Jason Statham is always fantastic in action films and once again proves that age doesn't mean nothing when making a one man army action movie when your invested.=Action
The action is fantastic, it's well paced, directed and choreographed. Obviously it is very well portrayed as well.=CGI and Quality
Honestly this was the weakest department of the movie in the parts that are well done, some of the shots were very weird and the CGI explosions were not amazing for a movie production.=Acting
Nothing phenomenal but it does the job.=Characters
Very basic, but likeable characters throughout the film and the antagonists had their moments.","

Absolutely shameful from David Ayer and a who i dont care to search of a writer. A complete garbage film with their twist of unoriginality coupled with a weak story filled with copy n paste and cheesy actors they found on Skid Row.Disregarding the fact they couldn't come up with anything on their own. This film is riddled with bad scenes to corny lines that should have been on the chopping block or on B roll. But that shows you exactly what this production was about. Smoking weed, finding a script near the bottom of the pile, getting some semi big names and praying they make money.Hell, even the cameras they used were questionable.This film was hard to watch and if you're new to the movie scene (your very first movie) this might slip and be alright. Itll set the bar for every other movie to be great.","

"The Beekeeper","Phil_M_A_Kerr","11 January 2024","I knew what I was walking into. Director David Ayer & writer Kurt Wimmer are no novices to the B+ action genre.John Wick has been taking up all the lone-killing-machine real estate of recent years. Where Wick leans into assassin/fantasy, Beekeeper does well to stay relevant. Turning on internet scams, dirty money, sketchy government officials, & family ties, it lays an acceptably current foundation. No, it's no Pulitzer, but heavyweights Statham, Rashad, Irons, Driver, Hutcherson, et al, & a competent supporting cast hit the right dramatic beats along the way. There's room for slightly better characterisation but one appreciates that the set armourer has priority over the acting coach in the high body count genre.My minor quibble is with the ""jello"" effect video cinema cameras suffer from. Not really suited to action films but when you're shooting fast and lean, who can afford the crispness of the film (celluloid) frame these days?","

"The Beekeeper","bernthharnesk","1 February 2024","I understand Jason Statham. His agent suggests him to take a job, a film in his genre, and get well paid.But, honestly. This movie I hope it paid so well he can take a free job for a movie with a real script and real actors. I really understand that Jeremy Irons signed up. At his age in the business, film offers don't grow on trees. This was a low-water mark with lousy acting. A movie, if you like Jason, that can be on in the background while you're doing something else. The cocain sniffing son who is the boss and the brain behind all scams goes to history in bad avrings. How could anyone let this guy in to the film industri?","

"The Beekeeper","redwoodsteve","4 February 2024","This has to be one of Stathams worst films. Besides him, and one or two others, most of the actors seem to have been chosen in a box ticking exercise. The plot and acting is appalling, with the main emphasis on killing as many people as possible in a John Wick 3, type of movie. Having Potus as the head of the large criminal organisation The Beekeeper is trying to eradicate, has to be from someone with little respect of the real world or common sense and then, top it off, having the 20 year old son of Potus be the mastermind behind his mother's empire is mind boggling. I'm sure some will enjoy the film, but for me it was a big disappointment.","

But you were wrong. This movie was written by all the rejects that weren't on strike apparently and I don't know how they wrote some of these lines and then said "" That's good, let's go to print. "". This could have been so cool. The best thing in this whole movie was the FBI partner of the garbage female lead. The cat from the Hunger Games did an okay job of making sure that you didn't like him so he probably wasn't bad either in hindsight. Everyone leaving the theater we were in was like WTF did we just watch. The ending conflict at the compound with all of the secret service agents not protesting the massive amount of comical contract killers in proximity to President was just lazy.","

"The Beekeeper","btb154","18 January 2024","I hadn't seen anything about this movie's ""plot"" (using that term very fast and loosely) ahead of my viewing except for the poster. I was able to articulate the entire plot to my wife before walking into the theater. Basically this one man goes through two branches of the federal law enforcement agencies without getting even a scratch. All law enforcement agencies behave like the keystone cops. Zero efforts were taken to write the smallest amount of realism into this script. I strongly believe Jeromy Irons can actually be scene laughing to him self during some of his ""serious scenes"" because he's going to fire his agent while at the same time thinking to himself ""I've done Shakespeare!"" The only positive aspects are the legitimate phishing scam used at the beginning (not the software) and the fight choreography which can be seen done much better in any of the John Wick films. I made sure to throw away my ticket stub to avoid any reminders or evidence I've seen this film. It's physically impossible to provide spoilers to this movie because there Was no plot.","

No character is capable of showing any emotions to connect you with the story. The bees and cars on fire have better expressions than human in this movie. This feels like AI written script that puts the bees in the center of universe. A US President with British accent? I know it is a work of fiction but it wouldn't hurt to get basic facts right.

"The Beekeeper","wirednights","19 February 2024","With such a unique and eye-catching name as the Beekeeper, I was excited for this. I thought he'd use the bees to assassinate people, which would've been cooler than the actual movie premise. Then I started asking myself why I'm not watching John Wick instead. Staham in a raspy voice: ""Sometimes when there's dysfunction in the hive, you have to take out the queen"" lol ok. Is this the product of the writers strike? It would've been more believable if the call center was in India, not Massachusetts. But realism would upset someone. Beekeepers are a rip-off of Treadstone from the Jason Bourne series. The CGI office building explosion left me depressed. My conflusion: If you want real explosions, watch a real movie.They send a female beekeeper to take out Statham.. you probably forgot about her because she's dead in 30 seconds. Very anticlimactic and utterly pointless waste of runtime. The cringey Scottish guy at the end looks like a bad guy from Streets of Rage on Sega Genesis. Who writes this garbage? I can't believe Miramax put their name on this. This was worse than Thanksgiving 2023. I can enjoy brainless action movies, but this just did not work. Agent Verona Parker's character is so eye-rolling and unlikeable. She just sucked and was not believable as an FBI agent. Statham looks tired, he's less of a character in this movie and more of a plot device. Statham needs to retire, I'm not taking the bait again. He was good in Transporter 1 and The Mechanic, and that's all.","

There were Multiple People Laughing throughout the Audience, so the Fun Factor was Definitely There.🐝/ 🌍 I Mean the Core Concept of the World of Bees that is used as a Juxtaposition against Humanity and It's Upper Echelon of Constructs was a Great Idea.Let's do the Positives First -1. 😠Or🎉Or🤡. The Tone of the Film. I Love this Tone . It's Basically Jason Statham is Dead Serious(Every Time he is around FBI, Security Guards or the Scam Workers it's Funny because he plays it Dead Seriously and Everything Around him is Pretty Much a Joke😂🤣), with Everyone Else Being 1 of 5 Things -1a. 🃏 Characters are either Flamboyant Caricatures (Hosts of the Scam, Australian Guy and his Crew and The Pink Jacket Beekeeper)
1b. 🎉 Or Have this Comedic/Jovial Tone About them (Workers of the Scam in this Corporate Building, The FBI couple, one of them whose Mother Just Died by the Way 🤦🏻😂)
1c. Or Cannon Fodder(Seals, Delta Force, Heavily Armed FBI Guys)
1d. 😠 Or Serious (2nd in command of FBI, The President)
1e. 💆 Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are doing some sort of Whimsical/Serious at Times Tone.2. 📜.....I think the Opening Works, and Many of the Ideas of the Film are Great. But where are the Thawing out and Details of Pretty much everything in this Film?3. 💣 The Action Scenes. Some of the Action Scenes were Ok and Others Were Great. Particularly -3a. FBI outside the Building Scene.3b. The Elevator Scene.3c. 🃏 The Pink Jacket Beekeeper Scene. (LOL it was just outta nowhere and Ridiculous yet Entertaining)3d. 🔪 The One on One Fight Scene near the End. WHAT A SCENE! IT GOT PRETTY INTENSE. Multiple Oooooossss from the Audience I was with.On to the Negatives -1a. 📜 Did they Rush the Script or Something? Again the Core Concept of the Bees ""Keeping Things in Check"" is a Great idea. Where's the Fleshing out of this and Everything Else?1b. 🐝 So the Beekeepers are So Deadly Right? So Deadly, that the Beekeepers make the Delta Force and the Navy Seals look like Wimps right? So why does Jason Statham Dispatch of a Flamboyantly Dressed Eccentric Beekeeper 🐝 with Not Too Much Effort? I mean, she didn't last that long, at all. Some of the Navy Seals put up more of a Fight than her(Not really, but you get what I mean)1c. 🐝 The Queen Bee Concept. So when the Queen Bee becomes Less Productive or Sick, the Worker Bees Kill her right? So why did the Filmakers Abandon this right at the Very end when Jason Statham is Staring at the Queen? Hello! He's called the Beekeeper and he doesn't even Follow through on the Concept? Ok so the Writers had no Balls to pull off the Kill? What about the Writers at Least Playing on this Angle At the Very End far more? Have Jason Statham take hold of that Revolver and having the Son and Queen There Playing Russian Roulette with the Revolver or Something. But I get that they decided to go with ""Well, the Beekeeper Killed the Defective Offspring"" I guess.1d. 🐝 You're Telling me that the Queen Bee didn't know where all that Money 💰 was Coming from?🤷 Neutral Note - Why is Jason Statham Actually Handling Bees? Is this part of the Beekeeper Training Regiment? Or Just a Schtick that's part of the Film? Ok that's fine, I have no Real Problem with that.Overall, with all that Said LOL. Was I Entertained?........Yes, I was.","

"The Beekeeper","Martipee","5 February 2024","One of the worst things in Hollywood is to see a popular star relegate themselves to B-Grade movies, either due to finances or lack of opportunities. Jason Statham should not be one of those, but you have to wonder why he made this movie.Basically, its absolute rubbish. Lets ignore that its an Australian movie, but considering some of the cast, the money on offer must have been good and included a free holiday on the Gold Coast.Storyline is about as original as a loaf of bread, the script lines were obviously limited to a small number of letters because it lacked a quality barely above a kids show, and the guys Statham had to fight were nothing more than statues awaiting to be hit.If you're a Statham worshipper, bored or low in IQ, its watchable, but be aware, you were warned.","

"The Beekeeper","lewatsfilm","11 January 2024","The story revolves around a notorious secret agent codenamed ""The Beekeeper"" (Jason Statham) living a peaceful life. However, his past catches up with him when his close friend is murdered. Driven by revenge, Clay must take on the dangerous secret organization he once left behind and uncover a high-level conspiracy.The Beekeeper is a solid action experience that combines strengths and weaknesses worth considering. The action presented in the movie does steal the show, although some viewers may wish for more suspense and violence (gory/bloodier) than what is shown.In terms of plot, some viewers may feel that the main character Clay (played by Jason Statham) is often lucky. While this is common in action movies, some viewers may feel that it makes the storyline too predictable.But in the end, it still offers an enjoyable experience at the movies, being a good choice for those looking for entertainment without too much critical analysis.","

Actually if you are open for it, there are a few puns or information bits about bees you can learn ... or at least hear. Bees are important - unlike some humans - at least according to the movie. That said: suspension of disbelief is quite important with this one.I do believe that John Wick is the better movie (franchise), but it's not like there can only be one. There is also a sense that the movie has a bigger universe ... if this is successful I do believe that we can and will see a lot more of Statham and others. Just saying - be aware what this is and what you want to watch. It is nice to see something from David Ayer ... he serves us something quite violent! Though it is not like there are complex choreography ... there is viciousness there for sure though!! The first action highlight of the year is here ... enjoy.","

"The Beekeeper","akcenat","31 January 2024","This 2024 action thriller aims high but fails to deliver. While Jason Statham is reliably gritty as ex-operative Adam Clay turned beekeeper, seeking vengeance for his neighbour's suicide, the silly script undermines any gravitas. Overwrought bee metaphors like ""time to smoke out the hornets"" make the premise absurd. Most supporting actors flounder, particularly the miscast female FBI agent (Emmy Raver-Lampman), who is, by the way, a terrible actress. The first half builds narrative momentum around Clay's crusade against predatory scammers, but the stakes needed raising, not contradicting. Once Clay infiltrates the corporation behind the phone schemes, the film descends into generic action movie tropes we've seen done better. Statham's action sequences still pack a punch but can't save the nonsensical plot. Even at a brisk 105 minutes, The Beekeeper starts strongly before losing its narrative sting. This would-be franchise-launcher leaves a bad taste. Not recommended.Rating: 5 out of 10 IMDb stars.","

How they got the likes of Jeremy Irons, Phylicia Rashad, Minnie Driver and Statham himself to appear in this movie is beyond belief. I also find it hard to believe that the writer of this drivel, Kurt Wimmer, is the same guy who wrote the action thriller 'Salt' starring Angelina Jolie, which is a seriously underrated film. I don't wish to put spoilers into this review or give away any of the plot, so I won't, but just to give you an idea of how poor this film is, all the Secret Service agents are running around wearing armoured vests with SECRET SERVICE written on the back in huge letters.

The Beekeeper has the most bee-related puns since The Bee Movie, and that is not a good thing. The movie will be entertaining for some, but if I'm being honest, we've all seen this movie before. It's a Jason Statham action movie and does not deviate from the pattern. Heck, it's a lesser John Wick. And yet, yeah... the action is good. It's a mindless popcorn flick that escalates quickly, and some will love it for that, however, I see it maybe only being fun after having a few drinks and putting it on with a group of friends - it's pretty silly and very undemanding of its audience. Yes, The Beekeeper is indeed a very mid-January film - lots of cheap thrills and corny one-liners.","

This was all written by a 15 year old as a weekend project.It's all beyond ridiculous.Even Statham's usual delivery can't salvage the ""zinger"" phrases in this movie. Not even that.Still, the action is good.Watch it for the action. With beer. With friends around, making fun of all the silly and teenage-amateurish dialogs.You'll walk out thinking that you should not have enjoyed this horrible movie, and that you can also be a Hollywood screenwriter. Easily.By the way, they spent 40 million to do this... I can only imagine Statham walked out of the movie loaded.","

"The Beekeeper","fallyhag","10 February 2024","I went into this film, knowing the actor and knowing what he typically does. All my predictions were correct, this was a lazy story with average CGI and amateur acting.I try to reason with myself explaining that this is a brain switch off film and I should just enjoy the entertainment. However, the story is so painfully bad that I just keep screaming all the way along as it progresses to a ridiculously stupid and nonsensical ending.I did like that the film was addressing the theme of the scammers on the Internet, but was disappointed to see that it glorified the call centres, making them high-tech, exciting and energy driven, rather than the dirty poverty rubbish centres run by desperate people.The action was cliche, and the CGI was absolutely awful in some places. The violence was as expected, and Jason Statham did what he always does, together with his ridiculous voice. Don't get me wrong I like him as an actor, but this was just a very lazy pay cheque.The climax was so poor you literally have to switch your brain off and forget who and where he is going to because if you start to think too much about the details, you will just simply switch off the television and go and paint the garden fence. And don't get me started on the cliche villain who came out of nowhere at the end to help create the bad ass fight scene which wasn't really needed.If you like a lazy film with little to no thinking required, then this one is for you. It will no doubt do well in the box office, then it will join the Z list of ridiculous movies on the bottom shelf.Not recommended. Because it was so lazy!","

"The Beekeeper","paul_haakonsen","1 March 2024","Of course I sat down to watch the 2024 movie ""The Beekeeper"", as it was starring Jason Statham.Writer Kurt Wimmer put together an enjoyable script and storyline, which proved to be a good old fashioned action thriller. I have to say that while this might be a stereotypical Jason Statham movie, it was really enjoyable. I grew up on the action movies from Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Seagal, and the likes, so of course I enjoy Statham movies a lot as well.I guess, we as the audience are not supposed to question where Adam Clay (played by Jason Statham) keeps getting all the gear that he accumulates in between each different location that he goes through on his way towards his target. And he just conveniently happens to have duffel bags stored away at key locations that happen to be the exact location where he has to go. Makes perfect sense.Of course one can argue for ""The Beekeeper"" being a generic Jason Statham movie, and I won't disagree. And yeah, this is a one man against insurmountable number of enemies and still coming out almost unscathed. But honestly, this type of movie is something that he does quite well, and it is rather enjoyable and entertaining with these hard-hitting action movies, just like the good old 1980s and 1990s action movies.The acting performances in the movie were good, and of course you know what you get with Jason Statham in the lead. It was rather nice to see Phylicia Rashad on the screen, despite it being just for a brief while. And it was also nice to see the likes of Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson on the screen.There is a good amount of action throughout the course of the movie, and again, you know what you get with Jason Statham in the lead. And he definitely delivered once again here with this movie. It was nicely choreographed and executed on the screen. The action certainly adds a lot of flavor to a movie such as ""The Beekeeper"".This is essentially a good popcorn movie.My rating of director David Ayer's 2024 movie ""The Beekeeper"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.","

He wafts in and out of reality, like a god. When his best friend, an elderly black woman, of course (remember ""The Matrix"" (1999)?), is cheated by online capitalists out of two million dollars and kills herself, he seeks always the most important thing in movies of this type: revenge.

"The Beekeeper","Pairic","14 January 2024","Another film where Jason Statham floats like a butterfly stings like a bee, well he actually stings like a Murder Hornet in this caper. Not that he likes hornets, he's Adam Clay, an actual beekeeper. When online scammers clean out the accounts of a friend of his she commits suicide. Intent on revenge Clay sets out to hunt down those responsible, turns out he's a retired member of a super secret Elite group of assassins named The Beekeepers who operate outside of the Intelligence Community chain of command. Naturally he leaves mayhem in his wake but there's a conspiracy here which has a long reach and connections to the highest echelons of power. Some great hand to hand combat scenes, he takes on crooks, mercenaries and cops/feds by the score. The most unbelievable scene though is when another Beekeeper comes after him, won't reveal the details but nobody could be that crazy! While Clay is happy to shoot, strangle, stab, mutilate and burn alive the scammers and their goons he merely injures the cops/feds, a bit like Arnie in T2 kneecapping the cops. It is a very violent film though and the results are not hidden, lots of gore and corpses. Jeremy Irons dials in a performance as an Ex CIA Director. You will have to turn on your suspension of disbelief app but this is a good a action thriller. Directed by David Ayer, Written by Kurt Wimmer. 7.5/10.","

"The Beekeeper","jp_91","17 January 2024","""The Beekeeper"" is one of the best action films of recent years, its script that includes living in a bee hive is included in the lives of the human characters, from heroes to villains and results in a well-made story. The cast is good in their performances, although Jason Statham seems to always play the same character, while Josh Hutcherson plays the villain masterfully. The action scenes are exciting and violent, the humor used is very good and sometimes exceeds the ridiculous but manages to achieve its goal. The cinematography is very good, the costume design is outstanding and the digital special effects are a little unrealistic in some scenes. The greatest success of the film is its script, although it is worth mentioning that at times it is implausible but every action film is. A good movie for the beginning of 2024.","

"The Beekeeper","peeedeee-94281","21 February 2024","I didn't quite understand the whole philosophy behind the 'beekeeper' and how he deals with the hive and all that. It sounded very convoluted, and quite frankly, the metaphor made zero sense.But that was the least of the problems with this movie. It starts off confusing - the woman (Eloise Parker) Jason Statham's character Adam Clay is staying with, gets scammed and takes her life. Wait, this elderly lady is packing a semi automatic pistol in the house? I was expecting that it would turn out she was murdered by the people who's money she lost. There was burning food on the stove, so that seemed like a clue. Nope, she really did do herself in. No attempt to talk to anybody, including her daughter, an FBI agent, to try to fix the situation. The daughter by the way, was dull, and fell shoehorned in. If the daughter stopped showing up in the film, you wouldn't have noticed she was missing.Going back to what sets off Adam Clay in the first place. Statham just happens to drop off a jar of honey at the same time that Parker's daughter happens to show up, and they both see Mother Parker dead. And we learn soon after that she hardly visited her mother, but just happened to visit the house this exact second, no reason. I was expecting that she would say 'my mom's burglar alarm was tripped and I was called to check it out', but nope, just random.Then throughout the movie, Adam Clay goes on a rampage burning down the companies and subcompanies run by the scammer. The big twist, which was also pointless, was this spoiled brat scammer was the son of the current US (woman) president. What? How did that even matter to the story?What is really odd as well, was that Statham's character went on killing people, and beating up law enforcement, but at no time did he show he even know how or tried, to get back any of the money. The charity was still out $2million at the end of the film, and that was pretty much it. He had one big fight with a merc at the end who for whatever reason, it was decided giving him an artificial leg would be a useful plot device. It didn't add much to the fight scene at all.Also disappointing was the earlier fight scene where the 'current' beekeeper is sent to deal with Adam Clay, the former one. SHE goes on a murder rampage at a gas station with a mini gun, and nobody in Law Enforcement seems even mildly astonished at the scale of the damage. It was hilarious how bad this scene was done.Overall a movie that I only give 2 stars because some of the fight scenes were well done, but overall, a waste of time to watch.","

In my mind he's akin to Bruce Willis in his prime.This mind numbing cruedly written film is a stain on his career.One must consider this movie is made to teenagers and the mentally infirm.The acting was wooden with cheesey one liners that went out of fashion in the 1990's.The colourful monkey type creature with the South African accent near the end typified this train wreck of a movie.It was brash, unintelligent, unbelieveable action scenes where Statham carves his way through SWAT and Speicla Forces teams like they're new recruits.If I was 13 I might be in awe of his Superman like skills. However as an adult that's mastered the ability to tie my own shoe laces I watched this nonsense from start to abrupt finish like a stunned mullet.I gave it a 5 just because of the action scenes. Then thought about it more and lowered it to a 4. Then thought about it again and lowered it to a 3.It's a downward spiral really, just like Statham's possible career path.Watch this movie with a good book.","

Stellar fight choreography, brutal kills, and Josh Hutcherson as an extremely hateable villain.

"The Beekeeper","torrascotia","5 March 2024","Isn't it interesting just how much Argyll has been promoted whereas this seems to have buzzed in from nowhere? Both of these movies sit within the spy/action genre however there is night and day when it comes to which is the superior movie.The Beekeeper is a standard action/revenge flick in which Statham plays his usual action role, except this is more John Wick than giant CGI shark. When a friend commits suicide after been scammed online he sets out to cause some damage. And he does. In spades. While it has a similar premise to the recent Equalizer movies, this one bothers less with the dialogue and seems to fly in as a result. Compared with Argyll which seems to have a teenage girl audience in mind, Beekeeper is strictly aimed at a male demographic that appreciates carnage and takes itself seriously as it does so. Fans of Reacher or Terminal List will enjoy this. The only downside is the obvious sassy black female cop character that feels like its been added to tick a box. Its crazy to think I wasted over two hours on Argyll when I had this waiting on me. The ending was also well executed and the 90 mins simply flew past. Hopefully this gets a sequel.","

There are 2 prime actors (Statham, Irons) and some actors with lower profiles and famousness. The story and plot is straight: Revenge with no remorse. There is nothing else. So, one could take that simple thing and go with that and put it in a half-decent, fitting story and script that. What does not fit that script is wooden dialoges, acting and lineup based on a scrummy script and casting. There is simply too much distance and non-fittance in the lineup. Then, there are the story elements after the beginning - again, too much rotten wood. And then, the finale, which is not understandable: Is it a comical, satirical garden party with kids hunting each other or does the producer think, this can be take serous?All in all and unfortunately, a movie, that will be forgotten fast on the heap of kind of too cheap chunk...

This movie is awful but it descends into another whole new level of hell when Adam Basil's character comes on. A brutally bad South African accent is actually only the 3rd worst part of this character but its actually exceeded by his painful over-acting and overall implausibility, and the fact that he is dressed like a banana but is allowed to be at a tea party held on the president's estate? All I can say in the man's defence is that he is not alone in the terrible acting that has added no value to the lives of anyone who has seen this movie. My only hope is that the last of the ammunition was saved for the screenwriters and production team.Please run as fast as you can away from this.

Nonetheless, I went to see this anyway!The film follows The Beekeeper, a one man's brutal campaign for vengeance takes on national stakes after he is revealed to be a former Operative of a powerful & clandestine organization known as ""Beekeepers""! He'll stop at nothing to deliver raw justice to those who have it coming to them!I found the film to be ace! You just know within the first 15-20 minutes that The Beekeeper, AKA Jason Statham will deliver the goods as soon those responsible cross the line! The story-line is pretty good & straight forward! While it's not 100% unique, who cares! It's a simple story line with plenty of badarse action, explosions & fights to get you through the 1 hour & 40 minute (100 minute) runtime with some fast, high octane action!Jason Statham does it again in this film as he kicks arse & gets the job done! The other characters are pretty good & play their parts really well too! There's also some familiar faces as well so that's also a plus! I honestly, can't think of anything much negative to say about this flick, it's ace & probably one of the best action films I've seen in a long while!Overall, you won't be disappointed by this one, it exceeded my expectations & delivered so it did!

The plot is good, performances are great and doesn't make you tired but can make you think.Many internet scams are around and this movie shows how easy an older age person can be scammed and lose what achieved in the life time. I suggest to watch it!","

"The Beekeeper","NinaCu","5 February 2024","This appeared to be the usual viligante movie by Jason Stratham, which are usually above average; and which reliably deliver at least somewhat plausible action... Unfortunately, the audio engineering was so poor that the movie was unintelligible -- without a studio quality audio compressor.It seems that the current generation of audio engineers has damaged their hearing with excessively loud music -- to the extent that they have disabled their capacity to effectively engineer audio which properly utilizes the additional dynamic range made available by modern technology.For the rest of you... the objective of greater dynamic range is not to make whspering inaudibly quiet, and explosions make your ears ring. The objective is to expand the range downward, along with the additional reduction of the noise floor. I.e., if you drop the signal to noice ratio from -60dB to -100dB, that allows an increase of dynamic range by 40dB. Specifically, the ability to hear all the audio subtlety and nuance that was previously LOST IN THE NOISE. Instead, contemporary audio engineers merely dispose of that nuance and subtlety, and reduce the speaking level -- to make room for louder explosions.Imagine the same situation for the video presentation, on a screen that could deliver the brightness of the sun (1 Billion NITS). Does that mean the cinematographer should cause the screen to deliver to your eyes, the full level of looking into the sun? (unless of course the objective is to show the sun and make you cover your eyes).Since I couldn't hear Stratham's whistering, under all the overemphasized explosions, gunshots, crashes etc... There really was no point watching the movie after about 22 minutes.An unlistenable movie gets ZERO STARS.SHAME ON AMAZON for creating junk like this, to foster PRIME media dis-service.","

"The Beekeeper","Luv2Spooge","31 January 2024","There's been a few really cheesy movies out about assassins, ex-cia, etc... with names like The Painter, The Bricklayer, etc.. etc... I just naturally assumed this would be another lame low budget B movie. However, this is anything but. For starter the plot is actually much more developed, Beekeeper actually means more than simply some hero's nickname.Of course a Statham film you expect a lot of awesome fight scenes and they deliver. It is like John Wick except with kicks, punches, and is actually good. I think it is especially enjoyable when the villain are a bunch of call center scam artists.The final revelation was also extremely satisfying, watching the Beekeeper enacting justice on Hunter Bid... err... I mean... Derek Danforth. I thought the mockery of the office of the president was also clever. She is a combination of Biden (awful son), Hillary (woman president), and Trump (business tycoon). I guess everyone of all political affiliation can appreciate this film.8/10.","

"The Beekeeper","jasmijnvdbos","19 February 2024","O my, this was hard to watch. The only good thing about this movie is Jason. Verona parker was the worst of all. Her mother died and it was like she didnt even cared. Jason cared, but all Verona wanted to do is kill Jason. Is she crazy? I would have helpt the men.. The storyline made no sense at all. And beside the storyline, her acting was terrible.And what was up with the yellow rambo figure at the end? They wanted to bring some comedy into the movie? Again: it made no sense.If your looking for some hardcore fighting, then you should watch this, because the fighting scenes were great and pretty brutal. But don't expect much more from this movie. I think with some other actors it would have made a BIG difference.","

"The Beekeeper","HabibieHakim123","19 January 2024","I'm a Statham believer, no matter how bad or awful the movie was it surely not Jason Statham because he always bring an awesome performance and aura that even though it's the same it didn't matter, The Beekeeper was one of the actual great one, directed by David Ayer, Statham was an unstoppable menace in this movie, sure Statham didn't need to do all those stuff because of the reason but who cares, it's a freaking Jason Statham movie that besides that, the movie actually have an interesting good story telling with great performances by all the cast including Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons, except probably the two main cops they were ok although they also the weakest part of this movie, everything was so interesting and exciting but everytime they get back to the two cops i've always feel like it was a downer tone, it could've been perfect if either they trimmed down a bit or actually have also an interesting scene just like the rest of the film, i didn't hate all of their scene though, anyway, overall i was quite surprise on how The Beekeeper actually not became a pretty bad B-movie action film starring Jason Statham but instead being actually a great movie, i have a blast in the theaters, those fight scene are so great and brutal, my man Jason Statham was never fail to get me personally excited, i love that man so much, The Beekeeper was surprisingly one of the great 2024 opener, already one of the best films of the year.","

At first I was doubtfull; will it not be a movie that is put togheter in less then 4 weeks? However it has a decent quality. People clearly thought about the story line before shooting it. The extra deepness of the story arround the ''bee-keepers'' instead of just acting the average middle class guy gave it a nice extra touch.Just buy your snacks and drink and relax a bit!

The beehive analogy is ridiculous.Emmy Raver-Lampton was some kind of caricature FBI agent who seemed completely incompetent and unbothered by her mother's death. Why was she trying to stop the beekeeper from avenging her mother's death? Lol.Josh Hutcherson, seems to have left his acting skills in his childhood. Jeremy irons also sucked. All the characters lacked depth or authenticity.Jason Statham is how he always is, which is fine, but his accent was confusing, not sure if he was English, Scottish or American. He barely broke a sweat after killing 100's of people. No real threat of death or drama.An abomination.","

"The Beekeeper","PedroReviews","3 February 2024","Jason Statham returns to the screen in ""The Beekeeper"" (2024), wielding his fists and signature stoicism with gritty aplomb. While the plot might be as familiar as your worn-out leather jacket, the action sequences pack a punch that'll leave you buzzing with adrenaline.Statham embodies Clay, a beekeeper with a past as an elite operative known as ""The Beekeeper."" When his kindhearted landlady becomes the victim of a phishing scam, Clay unleashes his particular brand of revenge, his sting sharp and unforgiving. Think Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills with a beehive beard and a penchant for blunt instruments.The plot unfolds like a well-worn action movie map. You've got the wronged protagonist, the ruthless villain (played with deliciously evil glee by Stanley Tucci), and a trail of bodies leading to a showdown. But hey, sometimes comfort food just hits the spot, and ""The Beekeeper"" serves up a satisfying helping of vengeance with a side of well-choreographed fight scenes.Now, let's talk action. Statham does what he does best: dispatching bad guys with balletic brutality. Bullets whiz past him like angry bumblebees, but Clay remains miraculously unscathed. It's a bit like watching Neo dodge bullets in ""The Matrix,"" but somehow grounded in the grimy reality of this film's world. It's over-the-top, sure, but hey, that's part of the fun, right?What ""The Beekeeper"" lacks in narrative originality, it makes up for in its timely context. The film touches on themes of online scams and the vulnerability of everyday people, adding a layer of relevance that resonates in today's digital age. It's not exactly groundbreaking social commentary, but it gives the action a touch of weight beyond pure entertainment.So, is ""The Beekeeper"" a masterpiece of cinema? No, but it's a perfectly enjoyable action flick that delivers exactly what you expect from a Jason Statham movie: bone-crunching action, a sprinkle of dark humor, and a plot that, while predictable, doesn't get in the way of the punches and bullets. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush and a reminder that Statham can still kick some serious butt, then ""The Beekeeper"" might just sting you in the right way. Just remember, don't try any of his moves at home...or maybe just don't get involved in phishing scams.","

"The Beekeeper","neil-476","25 January 2024","When online scammers strip Eloise of every penny, leading to her suicide, her beekeeper friend Clay determines that there needs to be some accountability.You know what you're getting with a Jason Statham film - it does what it says on the tin. And the action subgenre ""You shouldn't have messed with someone who has a friend/family member with a very particular set of skills"" is always enormously satisfying when well handled.And it is well handled here, both the hand-to-hand stuff, and the broader set pieces.The scammers in this case aren't based in Mumbai but are much closer to home, and there are some fun plot twists. The supporting cast are good (Josh Hutcherson is very effective as the chief (or is he?) baddie).This is a satisfying action thriller, with an ending which is about 5 minutes too abrupt - there are several characters/threads which deserved a bit more wrap-up.","

"The Beekeeper","trevorwomble","29 January 2024","This is actually one of Statham's better films of the last few years. An original story about a mysterious agent seeking revenge on the despicable con men who indirectly caused the death of his friend and neighbor starts a chain of events that spiral out of control.This is pretty standard stuff for Statham but it's very well directed by David Ayer and has a good solid cast. Statham was never particularly good at accents but at least his weird hybrid is explained in the story. However as expected he excels at the well filmed action sequences, and although there is a certain preposterousnesd that someone as distinctive looking as him can somehow keep evading capture without a disguise, his coolness in a gunfight is part of his charm. It's just the Stath doing what he does best, beating people up who step in the way of his retribution for an evil act.There's blood, gore and violence as well as bad language (although he rarely swears here) and the film is a great popcorn movie providing you don't mind that sort of thing. Statham may not be the worlds greatest actor but he's not terrible either. He knows what he's doing in films like this and does it very well, especially with a solid director like Ayer behind the camera.","

"The Beekeeper","imdb-23821","14 January 2024","I love Jason Statham. I'll watch his nonsense like Crank, The Transporter (all three), and it's painfully fun to watch his best like Lock Stock and Snatch. But this dumb vehicle he walks through as does the rest of the cast, without even trying. Even the script seems to mock the audience and I'd say a poor man's John Wick 1 but that's a slap in the face to the poor version.Does this sound familiar? Wealthy magnate has son who is a brat and runs his own lower grade scams. One happens to hit close to Statham, just a quiet beekeeper. Without an effort, J calls up his posse to find out who it is and nobody knows. J decides to walk through the front door, wreak havoc, and let the FBI fumble at who this man of ultimate devastation can be for half the film. That's after he practically broadcast himself.Move forward and it only gets sillier and lazier. J must take down the entire organization. You could throw the army, navy, air force and marines at J but he'll walk in without a gun and let his super fast hands of steel (ala camera slight of hand) do the talking. Then he'll go John Wick style through all of them, even without a weapon, through dozens of them. Imagine a superhero film.There is really no point. Something about a beekeper, a hive, a queen bee, none of it really needing to make sense, just to sound diabolical. The problem is this isn't a parody nor meant to be one. It was just lazy junk. The ending might be the funniest of all, being only interested in a sequel. Don't say you weren't warned.","

The villains here are so annoyingly smug you'll be waiting for Statham to get at them. Josh Hutcherson plays his role pretty well, acting like he is high part of the time, and Jeremy Irons is also good, although very little is done with him.

Jason Statham definitely is the action star, his choreography and attention to story and detail is awesome in his latest action entree. Non stop action as he does justice on a massive hacker conglomerate that tricks innocent people out of their life savings (this is actually a true activity going on today) he is unstoppable and the fight scenes are amazing, keeps you glued to the screen the whole time. Sets up for a sequel as well. Like the bricklayer and the painter he's just an average Joe living a peaceful life as a beekeeper until he's driven out of ""retirement"" by forces unseen who destroy his benefactor and friend in a viscous data hack and causes them to commit suicide. There are a few people out there in todays world that do go after these despicable groups who do this heinous hack crime and kudos to all of them. This is taking it to the next level, makes me wonder if the current administration did the same thing to get elected, who knows. Most enjoyable fun I've seen in years. Nothing questionable, no nudity, lots of foul language and intense violence and gore. Not for the squeamish or young kids for sure. Enjoy!","

I think this is one of his best movies, but I generally like them all. I am a woman and I don't know any other woman who likes action movies like I do, unfortunately. The Beekeeper is a 2 hour romp into that genre of movie that makes me hope there are men like this in the world. Beekeeper flows well, the action is top notch and fun, maybe a little shocking at times. Well-written screenplay. Nice photography, too. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Sure, some may say Statham always plays the same type of character...why not, he's great at it. And his co-star, Raver-Lampman, wow. I like this gal and I don't remember seeing her in a movie before. I feel the same about Naderi. I'd sure like to see another great script in B2. I don't think the Beekeeper/Agent Parker justice storyline is done yet.

Jason plays a beekeeper that takes care of bees. He lives in the barn of an elderly lady while doing his bee business-collecting the honey, etc. When she is scammed out of all her money, she commits suicide which makes Jason mad. That is when you find out that Jason is also another type of beekeeper. There is an organization called Beekeepers that takes care of things the regular police or F. B. I. Can not-or won't-handle. Jason is retired but decides to come out of retirement and use his skills to bring justice to the bad guys by tracking them down and eliminating them, one by one. Emmy is the F. B. I. Agent trying to stop Jason and Josh is the bad guy running the scamming business through several locations. Jeremy plays an ex C. I. A. Agent that works for Josh and knows how dangerous the Beekeepers are and tries to warn Josh about who he is messing with. There are lots of great fight scenes as the F. B. I., police, S. W. A. T.-and even another Beekeeper-try to stop Jason.It's rated R for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

"The Beekeeper","sinscopefilms","12 January 2024","The Beekeeper (2024) dazzles with its masterful cinematography. The film utilizes a mix of one-shots, medium, and full shots, with the characters artfully positioned at the center which was a standout feature of the film. These shots are rich in detail, benefitting from exceptional lighting that adds an impressive depth to each scene. The camera shots during the at night scenes are exceptionally clear, and the slow zoom-ins and outs are executed flawlessly.The cinematography is further elevated by inventive techniques, such as the seamless rotation from a 90-degree angle to a flat landscape view in the drone shots, adding a dynamic layer to the visual storytelling.The film draws inspiration from the atmospheric tones of Interstellar (2014) in its musical composition. The score is a fascinating blend of horror film elements, electronic stutters, and cinematic Hans Zimmer brass, creating an immersive auditory experience that complements the film's tone perfectly.Action sequences in 'The Beekeeper' are nothing short of breathtaking. Their realism is so striking that they left me in awe, my reaction a mix of surprise and excitement. These scenes are meticulously choreographed, echoing the intense action of Tenet (2020) while maintaining their unique flair.At the heart of the film is the protagonist, Adam Clay, a hitman characterized by his strategic brilliance. Clay's ability to think 15-20 steps ahead in order to unravel a scammer fraud scheme adds a gripping, intellectual element to this action thriller. The film, while drawing parallels with Saw X (2023), stands out with its unique narrative focused on scammer themes.I felt that The Beekeeper (2024) could benefit from a brief epilogue scene, despite its numerous strengths. Adding an exploration of Adam Clay's life after the climactic events of the film could have brought more depth to the story. This brief glimpse into his future could have provided a sense of closure to his character arc, giving the audience a deeper understanding of his transformation and the impact of his choices. A scene like that would have given the film a more complete ending and added depth to its emotional impact.In conclusion, 'The Beekeeper (2024)' is a cinematic treat, a guilty pleasure that blends masterful cinematography, a captivating score, and thrilling action sequences into a unique and memorable film experience.","

Writer Kurt Wimmer teams up with Jason Statham again, but this time the result is much better.There is much fighting, lots of great humour and yes there is a story, which is brought really to light by a much beer than I expected script, and some proper good acting, and the direction and pace is sedate in the right places, then bursts of action when it's needed.Jeremy Irons is very super cool and elegant all the way though, Jason Statham is totally driven as the beekeeper, and you learn a lot about bees along the way, Emmy Raver-Lampman is focused and also driven, Bobby Naderi is the suffering partner who is very sarcastic, but most of all, Josh Hutcherson, who was last seen in 'Five Nights at Freddie's' has fun with his role switch, his character is dislikable and we all have meet people in real like like him, he's superb too.This is more like 'Nobody', that stared Bob Odenkirk, not 'John Wick', which I have been reading companions too.

For those of us who like action movies on the other hand know what we get with a Jason Statham movie. This one will not disappoint as it's a fast moving, exciting, piece of action that's worthy of the $11 ticket price.Some of the best action sequences on film are here with a pretty decent little revenge story. I found myself rooting for Statham as he kicks apart the greedy corporate culture that preys on unsuspecting people.Turns out his character is one you don't want to mess with or piss off especially when it comes to his friends. I found myself comparing the current presidential administration and tried to figure out was this the useless child of our current commander in chief or that person who lost in 2016. Anyhow, grab some popcorn and prop your feet up. Sit back and enjoy one of the best action movies to come out in a long time.","

"The Beekeeper","cassidyblay","1 February 2024","Just caught this movie and I've got to say, I really enjoyed it. The film is a straight shot of adrenaline, packed with the kind of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Statham, as always, delivers a powerhouse performance, embodying the role with the intensity and charisma we've come to expect from him.However, the movie wasn't without its flaws. The supporting cast left something to be desired. Their performances felt a bit superficial, lacking the depth needed to make the characters truly believable. There was one character in particular, whose reaction to her mother's death (a central plot point) felt off-more excited than devastated, which felt jarring given the context.Despite this, the film had its high points. The humor injected through some of the characters was a welcome relief, balancing out the tension with well-timed laughs. In summary, ""The Beekeeper"" nails it as an action-packed ride, thanks to Statham and the comedic moments, even if it stumbles a bit with its supporting cast.","

This is just another run of the mill Statham action flick, but this time with a real sting in the end. Jason Statham the man I grew up with as ""The Transporter"" kicks ass per usual. The set pieces suffice with some obvious CGI explosions here and there. The supporting actors are good enough and of course all the villains are white with the ""United Nations"" of heroes serving as the FBI.This story really goes out on a limb, as do most action flicks these days. The political satire was just about as dumb as the real thing. I enjoyed the pot shots towards the Biden and Clinton crime families. Overall it's not a bad movie if you turn off your mind which seems to be all we do these days considering the low quality ""woke"" entertainment we're fed. What we have here is a real honeypot of cliche action mixed with standard modern day ideology. Nothing groundbreaking but pretty much expected, check it out.","

"The Beekeeper","Prismark10","5 February 2024","The Beekeeper is ludicrous action film kept in the air by Jason Statham's action wings.Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a mystery man who keeps bees and makes honey from a parcel of land leased from his neighbour Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad.) She is a retired teacher living in a remote farm. Eloise is scammed when her computer hard drive is infected and a helpline tricks her.She loses all her money and takes her own life. The scammers are headed by obnoxious young man called Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson.) He is a spoilt drugged up brat running tech firms who regards himself as untouchable. His mom is the president of the USA.Clay decides to go after the Queen Bee. Chasing him though is Eloise's daughter, Verona an FBI agent who wants to bring the scammers down by the book. Trying to stop him is retired head of the FBI, Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons) who now works for the Danforths handling their security.Adam Clay wants to do things his own way. He retired from a shadowy black ops agency called The Beekeepers. Even Westwyld knew little about them when he was at the FBI.The plus are the action scenes. Although I'm not sure how all these FBI agents and paramilitary groups managed to miss Clay with all their guns. The negatives are the story, laughably bad. The character of Eloise's daughter is atrocious. There was no buzz about her at all.","

"The Beekeeper","henry8-3","8 March 2024","Jason Statham is a genuine beekeeper living with a kindly woman who looks after him. When she is conned out of all her money and commits suicide, Statham seeks revenge and in his role as a retired 'beekeeper' ie an operative in another of those off the grid government agencies that hopefully only exist in movies, he heads out after the baddies.Anyone who has seen a Stath movie will know precisely what is coming here. It is all absolute nonsense and features our man kicking the sxxx out of or shooting / stabbing hundreds of trained agents in his desire to get to the prize. Jeremy Irons comes along for the ride to give it all a bit of class and overall it all adds up to a pretty average affair. But hey, he's the Stath, so we can ignore the lousy effects and the fact that no one can shoot straight apart from him and enjoy - just about.","

"The Beekeeper","pixrox1","17 January 2024",". . . is exactly WHICH Real Life American Presidential son THE BEEKEEPER is after. Many contend that it is the Weasel Shrub. However, a nearly equal number of commentators argue in favor of Don Juan, Jr. The True Facts favoring the former correlation includes top CIA family connections, a rigged election decided in a disrespected kangaroo court and a well-known history of alcohol and drug abuse by the sordid Skull & Bones Club whelp. Couple this with the thoroughly documented Texas barbecue during which details such as the unprecedented September 2001 Homeland Security Air Force stand-down to enable Manhattan's destruction by picnic guest O. B. L. And his henchmen and you have a very strong case for the fictional beekeeper offing a stand-in for the Weasel. However, given the still-missing folder of Tip-Top Secret nuclear codes and the KGB's first success at planting an agent and his Iron Curtain Third Lady in the West Wing, paired with his rants on the Voice of Lenin TV channel dominating Red State television screens, and Don Juan II seems to be an equally likely candidate for the beekeeper's mode of vigilante justice. Who says that you cannot slay two birds with one stone?","

"The Beekeeper","Boristhemoggy","31 January 2024","Jason Statham is Adam Clay, a former secretive ops agent (retired) who is dragged back into action by heartless cyber scammers who attack his friend.Jason is the only real action hero worth watching at this moment in time. You can call him cheesy and corny and indeed he is but he does it so perfectly you don't care.Some of the dialogue would be laughable in other films, some of the scenes would be classed as unrealistic in other films, and happily there's not a gun involved with unlimited magazine. :)
There's plot holes galore and some very questionable scenes and yet...this film is fabulous. I loved it and sat without moving from start to finish.Statham has that electrifying presence that makes you forced to watch him and in any other hands this film would have been a porker. But Statham safely guides us through moral righteousness, revenge, justice and a very relevant criminal committing cyber scams is his ultimate target.Entirely watchable, entirely enjoyable, The best action film in a while bar none!","

It's quite well shot, the action scenes are well choreographed and there's a satisfyingly unlikable baddie.Statham always put in entertaining performances and he's got a cheeky chappy approach to most of his roles that always keeps it witty. Like he knows that we know that he's having a great time. He doesn't take himself too seriously and knows exactly what he's good at.The supporting cast do a decent job and the movie reaches a satisfying conclusion.

"The Beekeeper","irivlin","2 March 2024","You will watch and enjoy this movie for the action. Afterwards, you'll probably hate yourself for wasting two hours of your life.The plot is about an ex ""Black Ops"" soldier who's living the quiet life - in""retirement"". The landlady of his bee-keeping farm is scammed out of her life savings by one of those computer hacking gangs. This is an operation in America and, as we all know, they are NEVER in the US - (silly plot error.) The landlady shoots herself and The beekeeper (Statham) decides to wreak vengeance on the perpetrators in his own inimitable style. His American accent is as unconvincing as a pantomime horseAs it turns out the boss of the computer hackers is the (female) US president's son. - A sleazy coke snorting character modelled after a certain other president's coke snorting son. The female president is modelled after a certain female who had (unrequited and unrealized) US presidential aspirations. She initially appears ghastly and amoral and, at the end has an epiphany and realises that she has to do the right thing and 'fess up... (silly plot error). The president's son is shot by Stathan, who manages to slip out of the white house, amidst millions of SWAT police who can't hit a barn door at ten paces with their automatic weapons. Jeremy Irons puts in an unnecessary appearance as an ex CIA director and - just when you think that Statham's fake US accent is the worst on earth, Jeremy Irons proves you wrong.Stratham, puts on a diving suit and swims out to freedom.As I'm writing this I can't believe anyone would write something so utterly inane - but there you go. It seems as if Hollywood has gone, not just insane but puerile as well.Should you see this film? Absolutely! It's as beserk a comic book action lunacy as it gets. It's so silly, that it's worth watching to see the depths that Hollywood can go to.Watch it, but for goodness sake, don't watch it at the cinema (someone might see you).","

The combat scenes are properly choreographed, well the scenes with talking moving the plot forward is fairly smooth.You have to suspend any critical thinking, but it is enjoyable watching him kick ass as usual with some popcorn, Coke or a beer. It's an afternoon other than that. The only spectacular thing about this movie is it's lack of originality which works for me since I had an afternoon off With nothing better to do!I wish they used real honey in one scene instead of using water, but that's the only thing I'm really bothered about actually 😃","

"The Beekeeper","panagiotis1993","2 February 2024","My Live Reaction / Review for The Beekeeper (2024): I have a feeling that this movie is gonna be good, let's see if im right or wrong. What is this? A group of people? A company that hacks random old people? Makes no sense. The poor lady killed herself after what happened? That's so sad. Adam is going to do something about it, I like it. Some really good fight scenes already! What Adam does is badass and everything but isnt he worried about the police? 40 minutes in and the movie is so good so far. I love that Jeremy Irons is in this one, I really enjoy his acting.So Adam was part of a secret group called the Beekeepers and now the same people will have to try and kill him? An all out war is coming, I like it. So Adam's next victim is POTUS or her son? Or both? Cant wait for Derek to die, he is so annoying! I like the president, she is honest. Wow, he gave that guy with the yellow short a really good beating. Derek is dead, hell yes. Overall the movie is pretty good. Good direction, an ok plot, good performances, intense action, fight scenes, explosions and more. It has everything you need, my rating is 8/10.","

"The Beekeeper","mags-06346","3 February 2024","The Beekeeper has a storyline that is simple, but keeps developing. It has a good vs evil plot, which can be satisfying. There are a few surprises which keep the viewer intrigued. Jason Statham is in a typical role, which he pulls off in his quiet way. There are fewer killings than the John Wick movies. If you like violent movies, this has got it. Here his skills are unrealistic, but the plot develops that sufficiently. The twists and turns keep it interesting and entertain. The movie does teach about beekeeping, so you may learn a few things. And, the bigger social issue here of taking advantage of people deserves a public conversation. So A+ to the cast and director for bringing this up.","

The movie is trying to creat a hero, but at what cost? Killing dozens of innocent civilians ? The No. 1 bad guy needs to rely on fraudulent money from those elder people whereas his mother is the president?.... The whole story is brain damaged made. Jason should not accept such a role in his career . Hollywood should stop using those no brain made scripts but review themselves on how to make really meaningful movies, like Godzilla minus one.","

"The Beekeeper","Cinema-reviewer321","31 January 2024","What I expected from an action movie starring Jason Statham called The Beekeeper (2024) was that it was going to be a dumb fun action movie with entertaining action and a great performance from the lead actor, along with the director David Ayer giving the movie some kind of style to it; after watching the movie I got what I thought I was going to get, and had an entertaining time watching it. The action movie The Beekeeper (2024) is an entertaining, dumb, and fun action movie that does not take itself too seriously with the lead star being cool to watch, the action sequences being well done, and having simple but easy to hate antagonists; this movie does have issues like some of the dialogue and how the third act is played out, but if you think about any issues in the movie, then the whole thing will fall apart, which is why I say it's a dumb and fun action movie.Jason Stathan as Adam Clay was great to watch him go on a revenge quest to get back at a big company of scammers that did something wrong to a person that he knew that lead to her being killed, so it is satisfying to see him kill off these bad people because you know they have wronged him in such a way that should not happen again; I also liked the certain skills he has in fighting, knowing ways to get in a building, and how he handles situations. Seeing him do his beekeeping job was fine and I liked how he uses certain beekeeping methods against people he is fighting; other than him, there is the daughter of the person Adam Clay knew who died and she is some kind of FBI agent following the brutal trail of murders from Adam Clay leading to the higher ups of the scamming company, but her moments at crime scenes were a bit unnecessary and was not that interesting even though it could have been, since she is connected to someone we know.The antagonist is mainly Josh Hutcherson's character who is a spoiled rich jerk who takes the money from the scammers and puts it out to other companies he owns, or he just uses it for pointless stuff leading to him unknowingly angering Adam Clay; the other character who is more of a father figure to Josh Hutcherson's character is played by Jeremy Irons, who has something to do with what is happening in the company, but not completely where he is also the Beekeeper's target. The action sequences are fun, well-choreographed, barely has any cuts, and is cool seeing the actor Jason Statham perform them with cool stunts and brutal kills in entertaining ways; Adam Clay does make quite a few bee puns, which can be unintentionally funny becomes the movie does not take itself too seriously, but sometimes the lines of dialogue could get weird and just too cheesy on how they are said. I do like the information we get on the organization known as ""Beekeepers"" and how they are used to protect people or protect the ""Hive"" leading to them having fun with the idea, but the third act took itself seriously on how it played out and how people were acting; it should have just kept going down the path of not taking itself too seriously.The Beekeeper (2024) has its issues, but it is a dumb and fun action movie starring Jason Statham that I was entertained by, and while watching thought it was like the other action movie John Wick (2014); the performances are good, the action sequences are fun, and the antagonist is simple and easy to hate so you can be satisfied by what happens to him. If you like cheesy dumb action movies, I would recommend this movie to you, but if you do not like intentionally funny and dumb action movies, then you should not watch this; I expected this movie to be fun and entertaining, and that is what I got.","

"The Beekeeper","bradencn","4 February 2024","Listen, I knew what to expect going into this film as far as what kind of movie it would be. Statham plays a great bad ass, and good guys (or guy) are fighting bad guys, and it's clear who's who.But by golly, folks, can we stop pretending that women are hard core police agents and leaders/directors of secret mercenary organizations? It just distracts completely from what I came to watch, it is dishonest and disingenuous, and it's an insult to viewers who just want to enjoy a work of art. For a work if art to have relevance, it HAS to reflect the human experience.So - will this movie resonate with action thriller chancing movie goers? Yes, it's worth watching on a steaming service, but...will the macho women scenes bother and distract you? Yes...further, they will annoy you.I wish Emmy Raver-Lampman a great career, but this movie makes it seem like she is just begging for relevance, and it's probably not even her fault... It's the fault of the writers, the casting requirements, etc.I didn't even mind the dumb dialogue. I came for the action, and I got the action... But it somehow got mixed with visual preaching that women can only be bad asses if they can be like men. Nah...not buying it.","

The bullet proof jackets were a bit of overkill. Expendables 4 was so bad, that I can barely remember what happened in most of the movie. But this one I actually enjoyed. Could the writing have been a lot better, sure. But I didn't put this movie on hoping for an Oscar award winning movie. My only gripe is that the ending was a bit anti climatic for me. They could have written it a bit better. Overall, I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again with my wife if she can stay awake long enough for it.","

They need to remove it from theaters, edit out everything but Statham being Statham. Movie would have made more sense without a plot.Is Hollywood hard up for writers these days? Was the entire budget spent on Statham and the rights to the subject material? Has to be the case. Credits should have rolled after he torched and blew up the first building belonging to the film's ""villains"".Two things are true about The Beekeeper...

"The Beekeeper","r96sk","1 February 2024","I'm conflicted about 'The Beekeeper'.On the one hand, it's fantastic entertainment as Jason Statham plays a brilliantly badass character - every scene with him is top, top notch. The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.Away from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. On the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.Raver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.The scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term shudder) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.I'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.","

Josh Hutcherson does surprisingly well as the movies villain. He does a very good job of playing a spoiled rich doosh bag that manages to get into WAY over his head. Several famous actors of yesteryear make appearances just to not do much and disappear after one or two scenes. There is also one major plot thread that is just dropped about halfway through the movie. Over all I feel pretty confident giving this movie a seven out of ten.","

(As if they were just regular people from the street,) And two characters were way over the top. The female Beekeeper was comically over the top. As was the blond merc towards the end.The fight scenes and the action, however are beautifully done. The whole movie is beautiful.A bit of modesty here and there, would have scored a 9/10.The last point deduction would be the yuppie villains that are also a bit cartoonish in their behavior (except Jeremy Irons).Still waiting for that one perfect Statham movie.","

Mostly, however, this is a film about explosions and bad guys getting their comeuppance. Fast cuts and more than 50 credited stuntmen and stuntwomen make for, well, buzzy spectacle. A semi-confusing script and heavy-handed direction from David Ayer muddle the proceedings, but enough inspired pizazz and Statham's earnest delivery of lines like ""I protect the hive"" just barely bring it all home.My Rating : 6.5/10.","

But all that is just talk. At the end of the day (and by the end of the film), the action takes center stage. It helps if you know the filmography of both Bronson and Statham (which would help you relate to the ""be nice to old people"" meme), but you can also enjoy a cold viewing if needs be. Very little wokeness here, an added bonus. The good old days... ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

"The Beekeeper","bekundaedmo","30 January 2024","The movie is phenomenal, the action is top notch, hit me like a surprise, David Ayer I commend you for this movie. At no point did I think the action was little or not interesting enough or that the plot was not good. Am going to have a hard time appreciating other action movies this year because of this movie. Jason Statham is amazing, and I liked how everyone responded when they knew a beekeeper was involved. This movie is one of a kind and if you are an action movie fan and don't like this, well you might not be an action movie fan honestly. The cast were wonderful and fit the movie, the movie was epic.","

"The Beekeeper","destroyerwod","31 January 2024","Lets be 100% honest, this is the most John Wick clone of all John Wick clones that i have seen. Is it a négative? Absolutely NOT !This movie was awesome in its own right. Instead of a retired assassin who got wronged, here you have a retired super special agent who got wronged. Everyone tremble at the mere mention of his name. And he can dispatch pretty much anybody with super badass moves unless he reach his target. Sounds familiar? Everything in the structure of the movie, even to the ""special organization using outdated tech that somehow can find everything"", is very similar to John Wick. The bee theme is likely the only thing that is remotely original.But as i said in the intro, its not a negative for me. I like those action movies that were inspired by John Wick and if done properly like in this case, i would take a lot more. The story is simple but coherent, having Jason Statham as the lead assure a solid screen presence, the action is very good, and the movie as little timeoffs clocking at only 100 minutes or so. Its one of those solid action movies where you just buckle up for the ride and before you can even realize it, the movie is over.I don't buy as much movies on physical format these days as i used to, but its one that i will add to the collection. And i really hope they make sequels.","

"The Beekeeper","Ameliex","27 February 2024","Jason Statham NEVER disappoints! I'm a huge fan of his movies, and this was incredible. The only movie from this work that I didn't like was ''The Meg''. That's it, the rest are amazing.The last 15- to 20-minute of the movie was nerve-wracking. You didn't want it to end.This action movie gives you everything you want and needs in an action movie. It is a movie that will excite you 500%.People are saying this movie reminded them of the John Wick movies, so what if this did? We have 1000 action movies that copy each other to no end. Doesnt mean this won't be entertaining. This movie was entertaining 100%
The story is about Jason Statham that is a former FBI/CIA/SPECIAL FORCES, don't remember what he was now.He rents a place from an old lady. This old lady got scammed by an IT company and they robbed her of all her money, like everything. She feels ashamed of this, which makes her commit suicide.This old lady was like a mother figure to Jason and he just hated the fact someone touched someone dear to him. She wasn't his real mother though.Then he begins the adventure of finding the folks who did this etc...
So damn exciting and entertaining, you have to see it!","

"The Beekeeper","dubond","31 January 2024","Don't let the January burial deter you from THE BEEKEEPER, a wild action thriller that works by enthusiastically embracing just how ludicrous it is, with every member of the cast, even down to the smallest role, knowing exactly what kind of movie they're in.In one of his best films, Jason Statham *IS* Adam Clay, a loner beekeeper renting a barn on the property of elderly widow Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise commits suicide after losing her entire savings in a computer virus phishing scam, Clay vows that those reponsible will pay, and he'd preferably do so without the involvement of Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Clay manages to find the office complex of the data mining outfit that conned Eloise, takes out several security goons and burns the place to the ground. All of this happens in the first ten minutes, which gives you an idea of just how hard THE BEEKEEPER hits the ground running and never stops. The data mining outfit is one of many overseen by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), a douchey, skateboarding billionaire tech bro rich kid who leaves the legalities and the paperwork to absurdly-named trusted family friend Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons), a former CIA director who has agreed to run the Danforth dynasty in the place of Derek's absent mother. When Westwyld reaches out to the current CIA director (Minnie Driver) and is told that all evidence points to Clay being a ""beekeeper,"" she wishes Westwyld the best of luck and extricates herself and the agency from the situation.What follows is absolute madness that almost makes this Statham's PUNISHER: WAR ZONE. It's the best film in years from either director David Ayer, who's a much better writer (TRAINING DAY, DARK BLUE) than a filmmaker (HARSH TIMES, SABOTAGE, SUICIDE SQUAD, BRIGHT, THE TAX COLLECTOR) or journeyman screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who's never lived up to the promise of 2002's EQUILIBRIUM. There's a jaw-dropper of a reveal midway through that I won't spoil, but this is Statham at his stoical, vengeful best, a welcome return to form after last fall's unwatchable EXPEND4BLES fiasco.THE BEEKEEPER is impossible to take seriously on any level, other than the palpable rage it shows toward greedy tech outfits that would con the elderly (it also doesn't seem likely that the FBI would let Verona work a case that indrectly involves her mother), but once all the pieces are in play, it also takes some pointed jabs at much bigger subjects. With perhaps the fewest lines he's ever had in a movie, Statham creates one of his most memorable and merciless characters, and the over-the-top, cathartically crowd-pleasing ways The Beekeeper comes up with to dispose of the bad guys had the small matinee audience rolling with laughter. Yeah, CGI explosions are apparently always gonna blow, but we've already got a contender for the year's most stupidly entertaining movie.","

"The Beekeeper","GabrielSymes","17 February 2024","Probably one of the better Jason Statham action films. Like the rest of the genre, you do not go into these films expecting deep insights into human nature, erudite dialogue, and so on. So it is with the Beekeeper. Except this outing was nicely polished. The characters were typically shallow, but did have interesting backstories. And the baddies were almost believable. Of course, there were oddities and plot holes. And the fight scenes were impressively over-the-top ridiculous. It is non-stop action with an occasional bit of dialogue to glue things together. The beekeeper angle kind of worked, if underdeveloped. This one is worth a watch. Even if you are only lukewarm about this sort of film.","

"The Beekeeper","deloudelouvain","17 February 2024","If you have a problem with Jason Statham don't watch this movie because it's the same character he always plays. You know, the one that is untouchable, a real mean badass with a soft heart for justice, the guy that will take out a whole army by himself, preferably without weapons as that would be way too easy for him otherwise. You have to be able to get over that otherwise you will never like a movie with Jason Statham. I found The Beekeeper one of his better ones. A good revenge story, with of course an overload of action scenes. The cinematography was of good quality, nicely choreographed fighting scenes, and good actors. Of course I wished it would look a bit more realistic, like almost everyone of us, but it is what it is, a Jason Statham movie. If one day he could take out villains in a normal way I think that movie could score higher. I would have scored The Beekeeper higher if it wasn't Jason against fifty highly trained killers, preferably all at once of course.","

With great build-up, increasing stakes, ""good"" bad people (not liking Hutcherson helped a lot, great casting) and dumb enough developments to be fun. But there's an underlying sense of competence that allows you to be entertained, and not laugh at the movie's expense.. maybe the dialogue could have been improved, but the general idea and execution is solid. The Equalizer comparison is quite apt!Easy recommendation for fans of the actor and action scenes with a purpose.If allowed, I'd give this half a point more than I did.","

But Jason Statham beating up bad guys will never get old.The Beekeeper wouldn't work without Statham, and the movie knows it. It has fun with its premise and keeps a brisk pace. Last month's Silent Night was also a been-there-done-that action flick, but it didn't work as well because it was taking itself too damn seriously. The Beekeeper knows what it is and goes straight for it. Jason Statham talking about bee nonsense and protecting the hive was a hoot.I had a blast with it, and hope for a sequel. Probably objectively a 3 or 3.5 star film, but I'm awarding it an unironic 4 star for being so damn fun.","

Agent Verona Parker maybe could have done without her. Didn't add much to the plot. The whole story line is a bit exaggerated with the POTUS being involved in the son's illicit gains. Don't think that was too smart of role selection. Would have rather seen a very high up CIA director involved in the scam, since they were using the software this scum was buying.

I highly recommend watching this movie, not to critique it but to sit back with your popcorn and enjoy over an hour of pure fun. Jason Stathan love him or hate him is one hard man in his movies. Jeremy Irons played a role almost identical to his role in Margin Call another of my favourites which was actually better than the big short. Go and enjoy a great movie..","

With the rise of AI especially, the chances for schemes like the ones depicted in this film is quite valid and scary, but the idea that someone like Jason Statham just living his life in peace and trying to be a regular guy who is forced to the call of action via a horrible scenario that is deeply thought out and downright corrupt and wretch makes the movie suck you in and keep ahold to the very end. I think this is one everyone should see, especially as we see the increasing changes to life due to schematic fraud and those seeking to capitalize off innocent hardworking people in the most nefarious of ways.","

And anyone who is a fan of John Wick can have a good laugh about it.I have to praise the casting for this movie. Everyone and I mean everyone does their jobs great.Everyone from Jason Statham to Jeremy Irons is so good but with a script too small that it has to speed through the story. For example, early in the movie you will meet a character played by British actor David Witts, he didn't play a very important role but his performance impressed me enough to look him up. (I couldn't even tell he was British). Great actor, with a great face, born in the wrong time.It honestly feels like the weakest part about the movie was the script. But at least it's very tight and quick, not like the 3 hour special theatrical releases these days. I can at least respect that. You can watch this movie and not need to check your phone for the time every 15 minutes.All in all. It's a great Jason Statham popcorn action movie. Just maybe don't watch it with friends that have some strong political opinions...","

The FBI are bumbling idiots, hired dumbies, who are poorly trained. I don't know if the writer and Stathom intentionally meant to show the real world through a fictional movie, but they did.Many poor reviews on here are probably from from people who were worried about the popularity of this movie and how others have connected it to corrupt politicians and corrupt companies.Hopefully well written movies, with good action & decent actors will continue down this path.

"The Beekeeper","JohnDeSando","14 January 2024","""If a beekeeper says you're gonna die, you're gonna die."" Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons)When patrician bad boy, Oscar-winning Irons intones this threat/reality, you can figure The Beekeeper, Jason Statham's newest blood fest, may be a cut above his usual tongue-in-cheek tomfoolery. It is, lusty as his revenge motif is and metaphoric as the title wants to be.Retired federal operative, read ""assassin,"" called a ""Beekeeper,"" Adam Clay (Statham),--hear the metaphor start ringing-- witnesses the exploitation of an elderly friend, Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), by ruthless internet scammers, ending in her suicide. Director David Ayer and writer Kurt Wimmer not quite subtly weave the analogy of Clay ridding the hive (read society) of bad bees, even ones at the very top of the hive's government.I know, The beekeeper is just another example of revenge porn, but they have crafted an early try at literacy while keeping us fed on the nectar of ramming order into a chaotic political world such as our current presidential race fosters. While the script may offer too many ham-handed allusions to the figurative underpinnings, I found myself pleased by the attempt and remembering how the Bard eloquently incorporated the motif into one of his bloodiest and most romantic battle plays when he speaks of""the honeybees, / Creatures that by a rule in nature teach / The act of order to a peopled kingdom."" The Archbishop of Canterbury in Shakespeare's Henry V.Statham, 56 and feisty as ever, is as stone faced as ever, but the surprisingly effective setup with the death of his friend at the beginning casts a serious and almost literate overlay to otherwise transparently fabulous death actions that would otherwise be plain silly. Avenging the scammed elderly seems noble given how many of us have seen the sudden blinking warning that our system has been compromised and don't do anything but ""Call this number!"" If you're old and electronic averse, you're ready to be scammed.Stepping outside the usually-absurd carnage, The Beekeeper touches on such important societal blights as corrupt political campaign funding and malicious interference of family members with otherwise benign politicians. Although bad boys are as bad, if not worse, than any you have seen in these oft-cliched thrillers, this film tries to be more original, topical, and literate with both the good and the bad.Not bad for a Statham cliche.","

In a genre movie certain things MUST happen and certain things CAN'T happen! These are NOT up for negotiation. Think: EVERY Hallmark movie EVER made. Does the girl ever NOT get the guy? Is the guy EVER a Bad Boy or a Bad Boy by the end of the movie? NEVER. I'm not even sure Hallmark movies EVER have bad boys! I'm only familiar with Hallmark Christmas movies because that's what my mother had on 16hrs a day from Thanksgiving to Christmas and if we visited you couldn't escape them.Well, this is an Action Genre movie and it hits just about EVERY cliche it MUST hit to fit into that genre and the RING is satisfying! Maybe one or two were missed but I didn't notice. The ones that do hit are hit HARD bringing real satisfaction!I forget. Does HE die in the end? Cuz that can happen in a genre movie.Who cares? If he did they can always resurrect him for the sequel! It happens in genre movies all the time. Why? Because when an audience decides it LIKES the hero, they want to see him again. And again. And again, etc., etc., ad infinitum! Genre movies and genre books are NOT ""literature."" There are no unwelcome or unwanted surprises in a genre story, UNLESS they are reversed before the final curtain.The challenge this puts on the writer and director is massive. They must find a way, against all odds, to make something unoriginal and formulaic LOOK original and innovative, without really originating or innovating anything. Now I admit, all of this sounds bad to the over-educated and highbrow among us - genre movies are what Martin Scorsese was talking about when he ripped on the MCU - but it doesn't have to be bad at all. If it can be done WELL. Hundreds of millions of people LOVE genre stories. Writers, producers, and directors have made untolded BILLIONS of dollars from them. Because when they succeed at the impossible, the millions and millions of action genre fans will reward them with word-of-mouth advertising and their film will make MONEY. Sometimes a LOT of money!I said all that so that if you identify as a fan of the action genre, this movie is definitely worth your time. But then, if you are a real action genre fan, you already intend to go see it!So go. Because you will enjoy it as much as I did.","

There is a lot of action, good fighting scenes and a hero, who does not want to be one, just as it should be. Jason Statham does a great job, he fights for those who can't stand up for themselves and in the end he gets the mastermind.","

"The Beekeeper","Swizords","12 January 2024","It was a good, well put together picture. Plenty of action and backstory to keep your attention throughout the entire movie. Like I said above, if you like JOHN WICK, you'll like this. It is extremely exaggerated but entertaining at the same time, just like WICK. If you expect the normal laws of the world to be true, you're in the wrong place. You should be here for the completely over top action and martial arts that Statham brings. I would like to see some more installments of this. I'm not sure on the background of this story or if it's based off of a books series but I'm all in. Ready for more.","

"The Beekeeper","abdelazeeme","31 January 2024","I won't say it's the movie of the year but as Jason statham movie , it's very entertaining and well done movie.I was willing to watch the movie in theater when I saw the trailer and for reasons beyond me I couldn't, so I just watched the movie at home and to be completely honest I wish I watched it on a the big screen. The movie has some plot stretches but for a movie that adapts the equalizer concept I wouldn't be surprised about a man that can take down the whole SWAT team on his own specially that's the whole point behind the story itself. The dedication of ""bees"" that mainly makes them a very essential part of our environment . The movie as a whole package is very good and was fun to watch and wouldn't hate to see a sequel to it , don't mind the haters that went into a Jason Statham movie expecting to watch Macbeth play's performance! If you like action movies that's definitely a movie worth watching.","

"The Beekeeper","dakwamyth-61293","12 February 2024","I like the attack on these scramming companies, and this movie dose just that. The law has failed to control these companies. And politicians use them. I think the only weak point here, is that the President claimed in Privet she did not know. In fact a Politician likely would have known, and worked to protect them.But anyhow, the story was very well done, and enjoyable to watch. Excellent cast and crew, that put this together very well. Statham did a wonderful job with his character, as well as the others. The woman that played the Daughter and FBI agent, did very good on her complex view on things. You kind of expected the ending, because it was the way most movies are done. But she kept you wondering which way she would go, with as few signs as possible.","

"The Beekeeper","arungeorge13","30 January 2024","The Beekeeper really is one of those Statham action vehicles where you can laugh at the atrocity of the plot (and its developments) and just tag along for the undemanding ride. Yes, it does feel like a John Wick ripoff staged a bit differently, though director David Ayer knows how to play to Statham's strengths. He's once again a one-man-wrecking-machine, and Ayer exploits that by effectively stylizing the action blocks. Whenever Statham's off-screen, the screenplay (by Kurt Wimmer) carries a made-for-TV feel to it, with random and uninteresting banter between FBI officers. There are bee metaphors galore, and for what it's worth, the entirety of the last act is driven by one of them.Ayer reunites with his Street Kings colleague in DP Gabriel Beristain, who brings in a sense of slickness to the wider, more elaborate shots while also neatly balancing it out in the closer hand-to-hand combat sequences. I think Ayer realised early on that the script didn't offer anything new to engage the audiences, so he decided to keep things as delightfully campy as possible. As a result, we also gets a few moments of dark humour amidst the strictly R-rated action. Josh Hutcherson seems to have had a great time playing the antagonist (a swindling, fintech nepokid), and while he's never a physical match for Statham, the chase remains wholly watchable. For a January release, I guess this did alright.","

"The Beekeeper","ryanculp-95641","12 January 2024","I don't understand those saying the plot is weak, if you have any relatives who have been scammed or know about call centers and scammers you would know they are a prevalent problem in real life and now in this movie.The only person who ever cared for him was scammed of their life savings and the charity that they ran causing them to kill themselves over making such a mistake and losing everything. Therefore leading Jason on a rampage to go through call centers and make his way up to the top of the ""beehive"" and shut the hole operation down.The action in this movie was spectacular. There were some gruesome scenes at some points with fingers being chopped off, soldiers being hung from ceilings, the camera shots were low and moving so you could see blood splatter when enemies were shot in the head. Overall, the action in this film from gun combat and hand to hand combat is phenomenal and on par with John Wick.Rating: 10/10.","

"The Beekeeper","healingtoolbox","16 January 2024","The Beekeeper's theme and moral ambition is a thousand per-cent clearer than 2016's Suicide Squad. Many of the same themes here, all much more clear-cut. This gives Japan Stratham strong moral momentum which wasn't possible in Squad. Perhaps the best Jason movie since Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw?This is a movie where you can and you do cheer when the bad guys get their just desserts. The audience I saw it with cheered out loud at the end. Since the 1980s, screenwriters have mostly beat up on international drug cartel lords.The Beekeeper suggests a better target. Beat up on internet hackers who prey on the public, amoral Tech Bros and anyone higher, whose allegiances are not ""for the good of the hive,"" translation: for the highest good of the 99% of working families, not just for elite interests.Jeremy Irons provides a valuable counterpoint to Jason. Jeremy is the older voice of reason; yet also, of the olf elite status quo. Jeremy is not the main villain. He represents the older generation who enable younger villains because it pays well.I especially liked how the motivations driving five or six supporting characters were fleshed out; and, how their varied motivators came into conflict. This made all the characters more believable.I'm ready for Beekeeper #2.","

I don't have much choice about not watching the films as he is a favourite actor of my wife?It requires little in the way of intelligence it is just easy going action fun. Which is what you want sometimes don't get me wrong!Here Mr. S. plays a retired U. S. Government secret service operative, Adam Clay who who looks after bees (hence the name of the film) in his spare time in between knocking two bells of **** out of people who upset him along the way. It later transpires that Clay was a member of a unit called The Beekepers.In this film, the target of the Beekeeper's anger is phishing criminals who clear out people's savings. In one such case, the criminals exploit the retired schoolteacher who The Beekeper is renting a garage off for his Beekeeping activities. She kills herself out of shame.A series of action set-pieces ensue leading to the criminals and the President of the United States mansion.

And while he's been in a few stinkers, most of his movies, while over-the-top, are entertaining.The Beekeeper is a bad movie. The plot is atrocious, the dialog is bad and the acting is some of the worst I've sat through in a long while. Jason was still Jason, but the rest? Bad.The portrayal of government agencies and agents was laughable. Tell your boss at the FBI Jason the Beekeeper is chasing down bad guys, and within 15 seconds he's heard enough and you get a blank check. Show up at POTUS' retreat, introduce yourself as an agent with the ""Federal Bureau of something or other"" and get waved through. Uh huh.Jason the Beekeeper was able to mow through thugs, Police Officers, SWAT officers, FBI Agents, SEALS, Delta, etc with no difficulty, not even a scratch. But when a one-legged, overweight Aussie with lot's of scary tats shows up, he's the one that gives Jason the Beekeeper trouble? Silly. Worst Statham movie yet.","

This movie makes REACHER look gentle, sophisticated and subtle. The silliness of this movie is enjoyable. We're talking 80s dumbness with a bit of Luc Besson's movie's shiny look and stupidity. This is a violent comedy vaguely inspired by John Wick but happy with being fun and crazy with some bad CGI explosions.Of course you have the diversity female part as the badass cop to side with our invincible white hero. Jason Statham is half Bruce Willis half video game meathead and the less he talks the more he's in character. Josh Hutcherson looks like Jack Harlow if he was in Duran Duran. Dialogues make no sense, villains are from Gotham's gutter and the Beekeeper can enter any room, access any building, borrow any vehicule if needed, defeat all adversaries.Thanos would have lost against the Beekeeper .","

"The Beekeeper","roaldknol","1 March 2024","I'm normally a fan of action movies, and I like many of the roles Jason Statham has played in the past. I think he might have been able to carry the plot, if it wasn't for the incredibly poor writing and the poor acting of the rest of the cast. The woman who played the female FBI agent wasn't in the slightest way alive or engaging. The drugged up crypto boy presidential son could have gotten away with his total lack of emotional depth if he wasn't the main protagonist.The idea of the movie could have resulted in a decent action flick. ""Ex killer agent goes after the president's scumbag son and kills his way through hordes of special forces to even the score of a sweetheart grandma being wronged."". It's a good premise for an action movie. How mindless and helpless the bad guys who are going after the main character behave, could have been excused as a plot device. They're just random thugs after all. However, the way the FBI, a group of ex navy seals and Delta force operators, as well as the secret service, are hopelessly and helplessly flailing about as some sort of ""John Wick light"" effortlessly wanders through hordes of them, massacring them left and right is not in the furthest believable.That's not even the worst part of the movie tho. I have a request for whoever came up with the idea that the secret service would allow the president's son to throw a party at a beach front property with a hundred or so guests with mommy president there as well, while a group of south African mercenaries are supposed to deal with the threat of a guy who just rampaged the entirety of the nation's finest special forces operators to get to that same president's son: Please don't ever write a movie script again.","

This is a great movie that's loud, exciting, over-the-top, and fun! It delves deep into the action genre and delivers exactly what you'd hope for from a Jason Statham film. The fight choreography is top-notch, and the stunts are heart-stopping. However, while Statham shines, some of the supporting characters feel poorly written and their performances fall flat, which can be distracting. Nonetheless, if you're in the mood for adrenaline-pumping entertainment, this movie delivers in spades. Watch it for a quick brainless fun time with not much expectations, and you'll enjoy it.","

"The Beekeeper","SnoopyStyle","2 February 2024","Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is the beekeeper. Secretly, he's a retired super-assassin from an unrestricted government program. His friend Eloise Parker gets taken by a call center scam team and commits suicide. He decides to track down and take out the entire organization. He is pursued by Eloise's daughter FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman). The scam organization is led by Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson) and protected by former CIA director Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons).This is like a less serious Death Wish or lesser John Wick. Statham is doing Statham. It would be better to have Verona join Adam Clay in a buddy action thriller. I get the idea of uncovering the program and choosing the morality of the situation. She feels underused when her character starts so strongly. This is slight fun. It had the potential to start another action thriller franchise, but that's unlikely now.","

"The Beekeeper","alindsayal","26 January 2024","Over the years, Jason Statham has been a part of plenty of action films which have differentiated in quality. We have another one with The Beekeeper and I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after someone close to him is robbed and killed, a Beekeeper goes on a revenge mission showcasing his former skills.Main Character
As mentioned above, Statham has played the lead role in an action film many times and he does a great job here, it feels like he can play this role in his sleep. It isn't the toughest role he has ever taken on but it just works and he adds some legitimacy for this role and it is fun to see him play a Beekeeper.Supporting Characters
Josh Hutcherson plays an annoying bad guy here and it took a while but I liked his performance here. He is just so arrogant and annoying that you really want to see him get taken down and this made me root for Statham even more in this film.Jeremy Irons plays the head of the company that Statham is after. He again is good in the role and is charisma is on full display here. It is probably one of the easiest pay checks that he has ever got but he is clearly enjoying the role.Emmy Raver-Lampman plays a cop and I didn't really care for her performance. She is a bit over the top and her character just makes some strange decisions and it is kind of convoluting as to why she does certain things in the film.Bobby Naderi plays her partner and he is also cheesy and really over the top. The two of them have decent chemistry but for me it doesn't really work in this film.Story
The story is pretty basic here and focuses on this guys revenge mission and in that it is pretty cool and exciting seeing Statham's character go after the people that have wronged him and the people he knows. There is also a pretty cool twist towards the end of the film that made things way more interesting. But some of the others character motivations are pretty strange and the overall explanation for Statham's training doesn't work with other things that happen in the film. Worse of all is the really abrupt ending of the film that doesn't really answer any questions and feels really out of place.Script
This is where the film really falls flat and that is the writing. This film has some real cringe worthy dialogue here, especially when it comes to the bee metaphors. But it is like the film doesn't have an ending and like the writers weren't sure what to do.Style
The film has some really great action sequences. The majority of people are just here to see Jason Statham beat up and kill people and you get that here in spades and it is easily the highlight of the film. The film also has pretty good pacing, it doesn't overstay its welcome and I thought moved pretty well.Overall
Overall, The Beekeeper is an above average action film. Statham is great and the action is fun to watch but it is exactly what you would expect. This is probably one to watch when it comes to streaming at home instead of rushing to the cinema to watch it.Rating - 6/10.","

"The Beekeeper","FixedYourEnding","9 February 2024","The Beekeeper is a typical Jason Statham action movie, with lots of fights, explosions, and cheesy one-liners. Statham plays a former assassin who goes on a revenge spree against a corrupt tech company that ruined the life of a friend. The plot is thin, the dialogue is bad, and the villains are cartoonish and forgettable, the movie is ridiculous, over-the-top and even offensive at times, but... I totally enjoyed it.The revenge on the bad actors in this film (no pun intended) is really fun and rewarding, it is like all the people you wished you could do that to got the revenge in the way the deserve. Statham is doing his usual job in inflicting pain on everybody that stands in his way, the pacing in the movie is great and there is never a dull moment. Statham is the action, everything else is a 2nd fiddle in his symphony, including the supporting actors, are all there to be props in his quest.And yes, don't try to make sense of the story while watching this, it will ruin the movie for you. This is a beer (or coke) and popcorn movie start to finish. The tech part in the movie, as well as all the government conspiracies, although based on real occurrences is completely blown out of proportion but still a lesson to be had. The bees knew what they were doing.Grab a box of popcorn and enjoy this action flick! Exact score: 68 / 100.","

"The Beekeeper","CANpatbuck3664","26 January 2024","The reviews I've seen for The Beekeeper laud it for being ""straightforward fun"" and ""an enjoyable throwback."" The underlying message is that The Beekeeper is enjoyable if you can appreciate it for the genre thrills. Now that I've seen it, you're going to get what you want from the action. Bones are broken, bullets go flying and the bad guys are punished for their misdeeds in a satisfying and well utilized manner. I actually think the team behind the camera deserves a lot of credit for this. David Ayer gets a bad rap for a couple of lacklustre movies sprinkled in with a few great ones (including one that's in the pantheon of my all time favourites, EoW) but his direction here is at least a level above from what you typically get in this style of movie. The Beekeeper boasts Ayer's famous gritty feel and this also accents the fight scenes. But I also think the movie looks really good between the cinematography and being cut together really well so I want to credit Director of Photography Gabriel Beristain and Editor Geoffrey O'Brien for helping The Beekeeper punch above it's weight class.I've already admitted to being a big fan of David Ayer but I'm also a longtime defender of Jason Statham. He's one of the few leading men with the chops and screen presence to lead an action movie in our modern cinematic environment (without putting on a superhero costume). He's a decent actor but more importantly, he's also secretly hilarious when given the opportunity (if you get a chance, check out his turn as Rick Ford in Spy, he's phenomenal in that movie). I was excited that he was getting another potential franchise to lead but while he's certainly bringing his physicality to Adam Clay, there's a complete absence of his charm. He mostly grunts his way through the proceedings and his character felt like a rehash and the type of role he was parodying with his appearance in Spy. There's some really talented names in the supporting cast as well and I thought many of them shone through some so-so material. Jeremy Irons brings his gravitas to the character of Wallace Westwyld. He's relatively grounded compared to some big performances from his cast mates and I enjoyed his measured take. I've always really liked Emmy Raver-Lampan in the Umbrella Academy and I think she's the overall standout in The Beekeeper. She's very serious in her early appearances (to the desired effect) but I liked her even better when she's cracking wise and trading buddy-cop barbs with her on-screen partner played by Bobby Naderi. She's definitely got one of the more fleshed out characters but she's got range and hopefully her work here will lead to more roles in movies. To my pleasant surprise, my other favourite performance was Josh Hutcherson as the unbelievably slimy Derek Danforth. This might not seem like a compliment as he's playing such a detestable character but I thought he was appropriately smarmy and unlikeable without chewing on the scenery (e.g. The admittedly fun but hammy job done by David Witts). I wouldn't have imagined Josh playing a villain but he exceeded my expectations in this role and he deserves kudos.I've mentioned the acting, the film making and the action but I have to get to the elephant in the room now. The script for The Beekeeper was shockingly inept and I kept wondering how it was greenlit in this condition? Travesty is a little dramatic but Holy Underwritten Plot & Characters Batman! Admittedly, some movies walk a fine line in tonality but not everything has to be deadly serious. There's also such things as enjoyably cheesy or deliberately hammy. I had some trouble deciding if that's what The Beekeeper is aiming for. The action scenes are unflinchingly savage and the film has a mostly-serious rhythm (the all-too-real scams, the political intrigue and government bureaucracy don't seem satirical) but then there's the tongue in cheek joking, the one-liners, the knockoff Wolf of Wall Street bravado from the villains, the constant talking about literal and metaphorical bees and over-the-top elements (a rival beekeeper whipping out a mini-gun at a crowded gas station kind of decision) that suggest it's a secret/surprise comedy. Are the filmmakers being deliberately silly? Are they in on the joke? Is The Beekeeper laughing with the audience or just missing the mark with unintentional comedic results? I couldn't really get a firm grasp on the desired tempo here but the conclusion I arrived at was that the film was serious and that the story and the script missed it's mark. The Beekeeper reminded me a little of the movie Skyscraper when it would careen into silliness. There's no doubt that parts of this movie were designed to be funny but I wasn't just laughing at those deliberate choices and I don't think that was what the creative team had in mind.I really tried to meet The Beekeeper on every level. My combined love of both David Ayer's and Jason Statham's work, an appreciation of straight-to-the-point action the movie boasts and a cast that showed up to work (extra credit to Emmy Raver-Lampman and Josh Hutcherson). I kept hoping for a gradual turnaround, a twist that would shift the narrative from bouncing between solid action to some disappointingly goofy dialogue and storytelling, or an ending that would ratchet up the proceedings. But it wasn't in the cards and while I don't disagree that The Beekeeper is a serviceable vehicle for some satisfying Statham punching & kicking but this movie could have been a lot better. I saw this with a friend in an empty theatre and we were laughing, rolling our eyes and cracking jokes throughout. I would actually like to give this team another crack at it if everyone was able to return (except Kurt Wimmer, he can just stay home). There's a lot of talent assembled here, I just think they hit a ground rule double instead of a home run. Check The Beekeeper out if you're a fan of Jason Statham or if you can tune out your inner critic and just enjoy the action.","

"The Beekeeper","ethanbresnett","13 January 2024","The Beekeeper is a relatively unambitious film that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or push the boat out too much. It all feels very derivative of the genre with no element of it particularly standing out.If you manage to wade through the tiresome bee metaphors, the clunky cliche dialogue, and Jason Statham's sporadic attempt at an American accent, there are some entertaining action set pieces to get stuck into.I do also think that the plot is perfectly decent. Nothing special but it moves along at a decent pace even if it is entirely ridiculous.Overall the Beekeeper is far from being a great, or even really a good film. But on the plus side it's not god awful. It's one of those films that has a time and a place, so if you are in the mood for some mindless action it will scratch that itch for you.","

"The Beekeeper","ferguson-6","9 February 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. For those who take pride in their ability to keep track of body counts in movies, I can only say, best of luck with this one. Boom. Bang. Punch. Kick. Stab. Choke. Flip. Our hero, acting alone, uses every available attack to neutralize armies, SWAT teams, trained security teams, and greedy scumbags ... all in the name of ""protecting the hive"". OK, it's mostly for revenge for causing the death of ""the only person who took care of me.""
Director David Ayer (END OF WATCH 2012, SUICIDE SQUAD 2016) and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (SALT, 2010) are very much at home in the action-violence genre, and adding the king of cinematic hand-to-hand combat, Jason Statham, to the mix can only mean more action and more fighting and more violence. There is no reason to critique a movie that delivers exactly what it sets out to deliver to an audience that expects exactly that.Statham is in prime form as Adam Clay, a beekeeper on a farm owned by retired teacher Elise Parker (Phylicia Rashad, CREED). When a phishing scam drains her bank accounts, including that of the non-profit she administers, Clay reacts to the subsequent tragedy by tracking down the culprits of the scheme. Tech fraudsters are easy targets because we all despise them, and the film plays that up by exaggerating the obnoxious nature of those involved. A miscast Josh Hutcherson (THE HUNGER GAMES) plays Derek Danforth, an entitled little bleep who skateboards in the office to his next massage and wears outlandish outfits befitting a person desperate for attention. Adding to the psychological drama is FBI Agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman, ""The Umbrella Academy""), the daughter of Elise, the woman who put Clay on his mission of reckoning.Additional supporting roles include Bobby Naderi as Verona's FBI partner, Jemma Redgrave as the President, a brief appearance by Minnie Driver as the FBI director (she takes three quick phone calls), and Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Wallace Westwyld, the retired agent charged with keeping Derek safe. The hook here is that beekeeper Clay is actually a retired secret agent known as ""the Beekeeper"", and in one of the oddest sequences, his replacement (a wild character inspired by Prince?) brings a Gatling gun to try and end Clay once and for all. The film is silly and absurd, and right up the alley of those who embrace Statham's stoic bulldozer of a man.","

"The Beekeeper","CinemaSerf","16 January 2024","""Clay"" (Jason Statham) has worked for an off-the-books US government programme designed to provide the ultimate security to the democratic process by providing unlimited training and resources to a group of people whose job it is is to objectively protect the system. These folks are called ""beekeepers"" which is lucky because our Jason has decided to spend his well earned retirement doing precisely that. He rents some space in the barn of ""Eloise"" (Phylicia Rashad) and one evening she invites him round for supper. He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter ""Verona"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. ""Clay"" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with ""Clay"" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.","

"The Beekeeper","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","26 February 2024","A vigilante takes revenge for his sweet neighbor.This kind of cowboy action movie has largely kept up with what your average movie goer is most upset about, and now the target is the phishing scammer, a group of people that we all agree are truly despicable, and thus there is great catharsis in seeing them brutalized.They even get a chance, and many are allowed to go as long as they solemnly swear not to do it again(!). The movie goes to great lengths to make them as utterly despicable as at all possible. It really lays it on thick; it's honestly rather patronizing, but I'd be a bold-faced liar if I claimed for a single second that it doesn't 100% work.The villains are unbelievably awful people, and we love to hate them. I will never be able to unsee Josh Hutcherson as Mark Zuckerberg by way of Logan Paul refashioned into a Donald Trump son, literally stealing retired people's pensions and showing zero remorse. Honestly, I never thought the endless stream of charisma and boyish charm who portrayed Peeta Mellark had this in him, but he looks like he is having the time of his life playing it... and so was I, watching it.Without a doubt, this is a live-action cartoon. There is nothing about it that feels quite like it belongs in the real world, despite the gritty stylization. The plentiful and nicely spread out action looks incredibly cool. It is not tense outside of one brief bit; this is of course what we expect from writer Kurt Wimmer, and director David Ayer, true to form, stages it beautifully. 7/10.","

"The Beekeeper","appusnikhil","4 February 2024","As usual, it was a weekend and I needed something satisfying to boost my day. There comes Beekeeper. As usual, It's a complete Jason Statham show and David Ayer has gone a bit far in the story by creating a list of exuberant antagonists who will never match the 'Beekeeper's' charisma.The movie was 100 percent satisfying. Well, you shouldn't question the story. Someone new to Jason's movie will be surprised by the massive stuff one man does against an entire army.This is a complete Jason show and he has nailed the role he got. The production design was also great. I do enjoy movies like this where we are completely submerged in the action bit and give no notice to the story or screenplay.","

"The Beekeeper","Pjtaylor-96-138044","18 March 2024","Although it's arguably better than it has any right to bee, David Ayer's 'The Beekeeper (2024)' still sits in that odd category of movies that are relatively enjoyable but undeniably total trash. The surprisingly good action, as unexpectedly exciting and gleefully brutal as it may bee, isn't good enough to fully offset the surprisingly bad everything else, and neither are the litany of A-list one-step-above-cameos (even though the performers all totally understand the assignment and wouldn't be out of place in a much better version of this). The set-pieces, including an effectively crunchy 'final boss' battle and some delightfully 'Hitman'-esque stealth sequences, are genuinely well-made and equally as entertaining. The choreography is sharp, the framing is clean and Jason Statham's physical presence is entirely believable (there are no obvious stunt doubles, for instance). There's also a nice mix of different types of action, and the bluntly brutal (yet knowingly absurd) nature of the kills somehow always manages to catch you off guard. However, the narrative is just total nonsense. While the film clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and is purposefully light on authenticity so as to be all the more breezy, it doesn't quite hit the register it needs to in order to classify as - for lack of a better term - turn-your-brain-off fun. There are several scenes which are just... boring, particularly those that saddle us with bland FBI side characters investigating events we've either already seen or pieced together. There is something to be said about the way in which the flick often presents its hero (or antihero, because he's a total maniac) as a villain, having him tear into scenes we often view from the perspective of the actual baddies and cause utter chaos before he leaves the picture to relentlessly stalk his prey off screen and the FBI are left to pick up the pieces, but even this is a double-edged sword because it means that the eponymous killer simply isn't in the film as much as he should bee. For a long time, the experience is straight-up bad. Then, Jason Statham starts beating the snot out of call centre workers and the movie settles into its strange rhythm of enjoyable action followed by dull non-action followed by enjoyable action and so on. The fact that the in-between stuff is obviously filler is a major red flag. One of the movie's most obvious comparisons is, of course, 'John Wick (2014)' and its sequels, but that series only works as well does because of its in-between stuff. Basically, the better version of this feature is more than a collection of action scenes strung along by a weak narrative. Ultimately, this isn't a terrible effort. It would be a lot worse if its action wasn't as good as it is, but it would bee a lot better if its action wasn't the only thing that's good about it. It'd bee enough even if the non-action was just mediocre, rather than bad, because the action is strong enough to elevate a mediocre movie fairy significantly, even though it's not strong enough to elevate a bad movie to the same degree. It's entirely watchable even in its current state, though, and it's breezy enough to bee worth a go if it sounds like something you'd like.","

If you like the John Wick franchise and you love no nonsense action this is the film for you.Jason Statham is brillant as the one man killing machine who is just unstoppable in the most casual way possible. Once the action starts it never stops with some of the.scenes are brutally brilliant.As always I don't understand who watches films like this and can openly give it a poor rating. After watching the trailer it was obvious the film was going to be a no nonsense action film, and it delivered no questions asked.

"The Beekeeper","aleksovski92","17 January 2024","Okay, let's get this out the hive right away: The Beekeeper didn't sting me the way I hoped. Jason Statham as a vengeance-fueled ex-spy? That's usually my honey pot. But this particular batch left me feeling a bit... sticky.First off, the visuals. The cinematography felt uninspired, lacking the crispness and dynamism that could have elevated the action sequences. And while the explosions delivered a certain boom, they lacked the visceral punch that truly immerses you in the scene.Speaking of Statham, he's the undeniable highlight. Dude throws punches with raw intensity, and his signature grit shines through every scene. But even Statham can't fully salvage the plot. The twists were predictable, and the supporting cast's motivations felt underdeveloped, leaving them mostly as one-dimensional action fodder.The saving grace, however, is the action itself. Statham commits to every fight, delivering brutal choreography that's undeniably entertaining, even if the CGI occasionally falters. It's like they poured all their budget into Statham's stunt doubles and said, ""Meh, the rest can be pixelated bees, who cares?""So, should you check out The Beekeeper? Well, if you're a die-hard Statham fan and crave mindless action, then maybe. Just set your expectations for a B-movie experience with predictable twists and underwhelming visuals. Otherwise, you might be better off buzzing over to something else. This hive ain't worth the sting.","

"The Beekeeper","matthewheneghan","4 February 2024","This film grapples with self identity originating from its initial frame. In the opening sequences of the movie the pacing attempts to have you believe that this film will be a broody Statham slaughter extravaganza, in line with others of his repertoire.However, the film soon falls victim to juvenile expositions and shallow, one dimensional characters. Perhaps the worst of them being a brash, young FBI agent Verona Parker. Each time she was featured on screen I couldn't help but feel that the dialogue was penned by high-school students working on a group project.The action sequences are passable, yet nothing inspired or memorable.Overall this movie fails to live up to its fun, adrenaline fuelled thrill-ride its marketed to be.The beekeeper fails to deliver any sweet nuance of action packed fun. For me, this movie is a hard pass. Maybe wait for streaming if you're eager to watch this movie.","

Incredibly well done action scenes with a John Wick esque vibe.If you love a good Jason Statham action film with incredibly cinematic fight scenes throughout then this one is for you. I personally think the overall rating for this is way too low but perhaps has been heavily reviewed by those that don't appreciate how hard it is to make a film that can be this entertaining throughout. Too many films these days have near 3 hour run times but contain long periods of dry dull filler. Thankfully this is not one of those films!","

"The Beekeeper","SAMTHEBESTEST","17 January 2024","The Beekeeper (2024) :
Movie Review :David Ayer directs Jason Statham in an action-packed drama, The Beekeeper. This title has a sweet meaning, but I dare you call this film or the Beekeeper's character sweet. That's sour and spicy, for sure. Jason Statham has done popular action films like Transporter, The Italian Job (a thriller), The Mechanic, The Expendables, and Fast & Furious movies, but has struggled a bit in the recent past. The Beekeeper is an answer to that struggle, maybe. We all know plenty of kick assss action movies, but John Wick has that universal recognition like no other film when it comes to the pure, mad action genre in this millenium. The Beekeeper might just be that John Wick kind of chapter in Jason's book. This is not an exaggeration, but a comparative statement, and don't misread ""might be"" as ""is"". It's an arguable statement to avoid direct comparisons and fan wars.Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), a retired schoolteacher who has never done a bad thing in her life and has devoted her time to charity, is scammed by a huge online racket. Devasted, she commits suicide. Adam Clay (Jason Statham), a beekeeper working at a garage, shared a good bond with her. Eloise's daughter, Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman), is an FBI agent, and she arrests Adam for his mother's death. Soon, the investigation reveals that it was a suicide, and then Clay is released. Verona informs Clay that the group that scammed her mother has been on the FBI's radar for some time but is difficult to track. Adam then takes his own path to find the gang and runs mad on a murder spree. His last target is Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), who tries his best to stop him, but he is unaware of what a beekeeper means and how dangerous he is. I don't think I should give away any spoilers on Beekeeper's identity and work and how he takes on the entire gang alone, so let's keep that part fresh for your viewing experience.Kurt Wimmer writes a basic revenge drama, and the screenplay adds some thrilling and brutal moments. Each time the Beekeeper is out hunting, he stings, and he stings sharply and on the right spot. Some nerve-breaking killing moments will have your eyes filled with blood, and there will be a lot of blood in front of your eyes as well. The Beekeeper has some insanely ridiculous theories about its main character and his features that look ridiculously unbelievable, but also ridiculously entertaining. I mean, let's say you want a hero who can beat anybody to pulp, can burn down any place, can breach security even at the president's party hall, and then come out of everything without a scratch. Wouldn't you freaking love him and scream for him? Kurt Wimmer has written Adam Clay, aka The Beekeeper, with all those features. The only problem with his writing is that it follows all those traditional packages you've been served for years. Predictability is not good for any film, unless it's a known/true story.Let's talk about Statham Man. He is a killer-a real one, I mean. Hobbs and Shaw showed his calibre and why he deserves to be one of the leading action stars in the F&F franchise, but sadly, the makers are too busy with others even after 10 movies. This man deserves a solo action movie like The Beekeeper to prove his talent. He scares hell out of everyone in movie, be it antagonists, cops, or even the bigger players in this game. Emmy Raver-Lampman gets a few good scenes, but even those aren't healthy ones. Josh Hutcherson is your rich, spoiled brat and, as expected, a greedy man and a drug addict. What more can you expect from him? Jeremy Irons plays the interesting character of Wallace, which I think had more scope but is cut short because he didn't really enter the game of blood. Phylicia Rashad and Jemma Redgrave's support is really helpful.The Beekeeper is a wacky action flick with superb action choreography. Geoffrey O'Brien's editing keeps it short and quick, with a gripping runtime of 100 minutes excluding credits. You'll see some decent framework by Gabriel Beristain that could have done better, especially the creative part of long action set pieces. The film has a few loopholes that should have been covered with some emotional quotient, but what's done is done now. The sound design and production design have been okay. It's good to see the man who made the first installment of the Fast & Furious franchise come up with such a violent flick that isn't about logic but is hardly illogical as far as a crowd-pleasing experience is concerned. Nevertheless, he delivers a worthy action drama for the devotees of the genre and devotees of Jason Statham. That retrograded ambition from 2001 could have been avoided, or, better yet, this film could have been made much earlier to have a better impact. But it's not that corny anyway. So, order your popcorn and sit for this 100-minute action-packed ride, and try and ask your theatre manager to skip the intermission break.RATING - 6/10*","

"The Beekeeper","latinfineart","16 January 2024","The film started out quite well and the very first action scene was excellent, though it was a bit of an exaggeration, however with a fairly minor leap of faith it was somewhat believable. From there it just went downhill, there was that Hollywood tendency to over blow everything and to stretch every premise to the absolute limit of implausibility, which just gets old after a while. You just you want to see some good action, you want to see a good story and you don't want to see a story stretched to the absolute end of what is physically possible in the known universe. However, if you like Marvel type films, silly stories made for kids, or cartoons, you will likely enjoy this drivel.After about 45 minutes, the film got very tiresome. I also thought the female FBI agent (Lampman) was very poorly miscast, and written, and the South African bad guy was just a ridiculous cartoon.It could have been a decent movie but it wasn't.","

"The Beekeeper","southdavid","24 January 2024","I'm not the world biggest fan of this sort of midbudget action film, the ones that seem to end up on the streaming services rather than the big screen these days and whilst ""The Beekeeper"" isn't great it's unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and some decent turns in the support cast elevate it slightly above those.When his landlady Eloise (Phylicia Rashad) takes her own life, after her life savings are stolen from her by a cybercrime syndicate, Adam Clay (Jason Statham) sets out to avenge her. Clay though is not just an ordinary vigilante, he was once a Beekeeper, a member of a special government project, highly trained and given autonomy to make his own decisions about how to progress a situation. As Clay kills his way up the foodchain, chased by Eloise's FBI agent daughter Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman), Clay comes to learn that the syndicate have ties to government agencies, that have the resources to mount a defence against his onslaught.So, all of the good work in this is done by supporting characters, particularly Raver-Lampman, so good in ""The Umbrella Academy"", and her partner in this, played by Bobby Naderi. Their scenes together elevate the film somewhat. Josh Hutchison is having a good time too, as a higher up douchebag who believes, and with some reason, that he's untouchable. One of the problems though is that Statham's character is pretty lifeless. He's proved in other films he's capable of being charismatic but here he just waffles on about Bees every chance he gets, which becomes hilarious the further you get into the film and the more frequently it happens. You can only mumble ""Protect the Hive"" so many times, before it ceases to lose all meaning.The action is fine, if perhaps lacking something truly interesting or memorable. The CGI work isn't as good as the practical stunts, and the fighting remains a touch below something like a ""John Wick"". If briefly threatens to accept its dumb nature, during a fight with another Beekeeper and become more fun, but doesn't commit to it for long.There's probably a desire to franchise the character, like has happened with other Statham films, but I really don't think there's much more meat on what was already a modest bone.","

As always, he beats people up and clumsily infiltrates highly secured areas without a clue. The dialogue is clunky and characters pretty forgettable. Please give this a swerve if you value your sanity. I do hope this is the one and only movie in this storyline and David has a long hard look at himself. So so poor.","

"The Beekeeper","stevencayer","22 January 2024","To be, or not to be? THE BEEKEEPER is a movie that has Jason Statham in it. There, if you know Jason Statham, I've given you all the knowledge you need for this movie and you can stop reading now. For those of you who might need a little more information, the rest is for you. This is an action movie that is the most accurate depiction of ""It's so bad it's good"". It's about Adam Clay (Jason Statham), who is retired from his job and is now beekeeping for Eloise (Phylicia Rashad), who is letting him stay in the barn. Eloise gets targeted by a phishing scam that robs all of her money. After tragedy strikes, Adam goes on a revenge rampage following the money trail, using his specific set of skills as a ""beekeeper"". It's very rare when I can safely say that I loved and hated this experience. The script is horrible, but hilarious. The antagonists are cartoony, but hilarious. The violent action is great. The non-stop bee puns are fantastic, but not for everyone. The supporting cast is actually good, involving a unique role for Josh Hutcherson, Jeremy Irons, even Minnie Driver for some reason. I enjoyed how similar it is to JOHN WICK. He's just trying to ""protect the hive"". Phishing scams are still very prevalent in today's society, and this movie is a reminder to always be careful online, unless you're friends with Jason Statham. He had a bad year last year with THE MEG 2 and THE EXPENDABLES 4, but this is definitely his niche. We just need to not take his movies seriously. If you see THE BEEKEEPER, just shut down your brain for a couple hours and enjoy the ride. I highly recommend this!","

This leaves us eager for the central character's return.Though the story echoes films like John Wick, it fails to capture the same striking essence. It resides in predictability, unable to secure a place in cinematic memory.The action scenes are good but not exceptional. The actors shine in fights, yet the excitement falls short of expectations.Overall, it's an action film that oscillates between captivating and monotonous moments.

"The Beekeeper","IonicBreezeMachine","15 January 2024","Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a solitary man who keeps bees on a parcel of land rented to him by retired schoolteacher Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad). When Eloise is scammed out of her personal finances as well as those of a charity she manages by phishing scam operation lead by Garnett (David Witts), Clay and Eloise' daughter FBI Agent Verona (Emmy Raver-Lampman) soon find out that Eloise committed suicide with the perpetrators most likely going to evade prosecution. Taking matters into his own hands, Clay dives into his combat skills he learned as part of a clandestine organization known as Beekeepers intent on bringing down the criminals who drove Eloise to her death which takes him through the highest echelons of power.The Beekeeper is an action thriller directed by David Ayer and starring Jason Statham. In a month that's seen no shortage of assassin/secret agent based action thrillers (The Bricklayer, Role Play, The Painter, etc.) if you're going to watch one of these movies, then The Beekeeper is definitely the one to choose.The Beekeeper is about as simple a premise as you can ask for with Statham's Clay your archetypical strong silent protagonist who motivated by some loss embarks on a path of revenge. Even in his 50s Statham hasn't lost step when it comes to delivering the goods and the script plays itself with a bit more humor than you'd expect which allows Statham to tap into that snarky side that plays to his advantage. The movie delivers some solid antagonists in Josh Hutcherson and David Witts whose cocky arrogance bringing to mind the worst aspects of tech/NFT bro tropes make them easy to hate and Jeremy Irons is quite fun as the head of security who acknowledges their deaths are basically foregone conclusions after angering a Beekeeper and only continues to organize protection details for them out of obligation rather than believing anything can be done. With the quirky clandestined world established in the movie regarding the Beekeepers, the film has more than a few shades of John Wick or other films in its DNA and for the most part if this is the beginning of a franchise I'm interested to see where they take it. The one downside is a sideplot involving Emmy Raver-Lampman's character Verona and her partner Wiley played by Bobby Naderi. While I understand having a character who follows someone like clay through a story like this, Verona is very poorly written as she seems like she's more upset about Clay's rampage than her mother's death and every time the movie pulls back from Clay to focus on these characters it only serves to stop the flow and reiterate information we already know.The Beekeeper is a solid ""B"" film that delivers the goods thanks to Ayer's tight direction and the always welcome presence of Statham. The Beekeeper like its titular hero is quick, clean, and efficient and you'll get your money's worth.","

The movie is directed by David Ayer, who knows how to deliver explosive set pieces and gritty violence, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who adds some clever twists and witty dialogue to the formulaic plot.The movie is essentially a showcase for Statham's charisma and skills, as he plays a man who lives a quiet life as a beekeeper in the countryside, until his friend and mentor falls victim to a phishing scheme that drains her life savings. Here Jason Stathams character then embarks on a mission to track down and punish the culprits responisble leading to a hive of concpiracies and plot twists.The movie does not take itself too seriously, and neither should the audience. The plot is full of holes and implausibilities, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, and the dialogue is often cheesy and clichéd. However, the movie also has a sense of humor and self-awareness, and does not shy away from poking fun at its own absurdity and genre conventions. The movie also delivers on the action front, with plenty of shootouts, chases, fights, and explosions, all staged with flair and energy by David Ayer.Statham is in his element, as he dispatches his enemies with style and efficiency, while also displaying some emotional range and vulnerability in certain scenes. The supporting cast is also solid, with Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson hamming it up as the villains, and various supporting casts adding some warmth and depth to the story.The movie is not without its flaws, and it is certainly not for everyone. Some viewers might find it too violent, too silly, or too predictable. However, for fans of Statham and action movies in general, The Beekeeper is a satisfying and entertaining ride that will keep you buzzing for 90 minutes. It is the best kind of bad movie, one that knows what it is and what it wants to be, and delivers on its promise. The Beekeeper is a honey of an action movie, and you might want to give it a try.","

Watching Jason Statham kick peoples a**es, its just truly amazing and done so well. I really didnt have high expectations, I thought I would see it over Mean Girls. So, I went and SO GLAD I DID! I just fell in love with the awesomeness of this totally action packed movie from the first moment to the last. I'm not saying it's perfect, but dang! It will get you pumped up and almost standing up and cheering at times. I thought all of the actors did well. The daughter was kind of a downer yawn for me most of the time. GO SEE THIS!!

"The Beekeeper","RobertGolebiewski","15 February 2024","Despite very poor reception by many reviewers I have to admit this is one of the best movies with Jason Statham and one of the best action movies I have seen lately.What I liked about it:Story / Problem : Computer stealing, phishing, current great danger to unaware people. And greedy thieves on the other side of computer cable. Trust issues. The cause hero gets involved.Action: Action is fast. Pace is quick. Nothing is boring. Actually you simply get good action movie. Very good.Fight scenes: great show. Pretty arranged. Best of Statham. Quick camera shots. Good angles.Villains: Pretty nasty in terms of personality. Treated well by Statham. They die in a colorful way.Corruption: The plot gets us high to power of nation that is involved. Actually I would be not surprised.Supporting cast: very good choice.What I did not like much:Female heroine: Rather poor acting. Yet she has nothing much to spoil so I am not so much upset.Summary: very very good movie if you like Statham.","

"The Beekeeper","DeathbyExile","14 February 2024","This movie is just fun to watch. It's got that John Wick feel but much less gore (there's still a little bit). It's a movie that doesn't exactly take itself seriously, which is a good thing. It's one of those movies that you go and have an escape. Sometimes a movie doesn't need to be overly philosophical or pretentious like some iterations of the Matrix. The writing/acting isn't as bad as some people have you believe. Jason Statham plays himself like he does in all the other movies. He's basically The Transporter, a cold calculating killer. And that's okay. He fits this role well.The action scenes are pretty over the top, but that's exactly what you're paying for. If you're going to watch this movie for the 'realism', you're watching the movie wrong.Go watch the movie with some friends, have a good time, and don't take yourself too seriously.","

"The Beekeeper","mujali-48677","11 March 2024","I really enjoyed this. I knew what I'd be getting and it did exactly what was on the tin. Dodgy accent- tick, scumbag bad guys- tick, completely unrealistic but fun and satisfying action scenes-tick. Big Jase going about his life quietly not bothering anybody, until the bad guys hurt someone he likes and it's time for retribution, Statham style. I'm not sure what disappointed reviewers were expecting from a Jason Statham film, The Graduate? A deep dive in to the complexity of the human condition? Films don't always need to make us think about our existence or be a commentary on an increasingly more depressing society. This is top notch fun.","

"The Beekeeper","otterspocket-44488","17 February 2024","How Irons and even Stratham read this script and still decided to take part is beyond me. It is the most ridiculous dialogue. The acting is so wooden it would make Pinocchio blush. The benefit is that it makes good conversation, laughing with your fellow torture victims about the utter pretentious seriousness the film seems to take itself. So, the Beekeeper is an analogy. Strangely Mr Stratham is so mentally dim he's not realised that and thinks his job actually does involve keeping bees. We also had an opportunity to not suffer Streatham's god awful American accent, given as he's supposed to be from one of ""The British Isles"" in the movie, but no. Unfortunately Jason still felt the need to butcher it as normal.","

If you are looking for a fun movie, with little depth, that just doesn't stop, this is the movie for you. If not, don't go see it.The main negative for me is the obvious DEI for the movie. White guys are of course the bad guys. The sidekick is of course a dark skinned woman. Obviously the only reason she got the part is because of her gender and skin color. The head of the CIA is of course a dark-skinned dude. Where are the Asians or Hispanics? Nowhere to be found of course.","

"The Beekeeper","rgkarim","13 January 2024","LIKES:The Pace
-The movie is like most Statham led movies, very loud and very fast, much like the theme of his series Crank.-The Beekeeper doesn't pull its foot of the gas for much of the movie, and for those who love the adrenaline rush, you are in great shape to enjoy this film.-It pretty much stays at a nice hundred miles an hour, but also takes time to reset for some faster paced setups to get you ready for the next mayhem to unleash on the screen.-All in all, great for those with fleeting attention spans.The Humor
-Whether direct or indirect, I laughed a lot in this movie, so much so that it made me have some of the most fun in a film I have had.-The Beekeeper has plenty of zingers to sting your funny bone, making you crack up with the way Statham dryly delivers a message, or Irons sarcasm and logic comes out like Scar.-Poking fun at the government system and the political jokes were toned back, purposeful and nicely finessed to be very, very fun without being too much.-And throw the character profiles being extremely goofy and adding an element of their own only helping further make the ordeal stupid fun and entertaining, alongside some of the stunts and finishes that just scream suspense of disbelief.The Story To A Degree
-It's got a better story than I anticipated, one that is simple, easy to follow, and perfect anchoring to the mishaps coming.-The Beekeeper's story surprisingly has some decent character development to mix in, helping give some clarity to a few of the players in this weird game of extreme action chess.-And there is a little bit of a nice ""twist"" to the mix that should help give a little more to the plot they are conveying, but not enough to trip or offset the main focus of this movie.The Action Scenes On Many Moments
-Perhaps the meat of the movie, the action is all about what most will be coming to see this movie for, and I'll say, it's fun to say the least.-From the first bout on, Statham and the team get creative in just how much fun a special agent can have with the masses, providing lots of playgrounds to do battle on that help mix up the theme of the action at hand.-Throw in the combat essentially changing hands to be one part martial arts, one part knife play, and many parts gunplay, and well, you have one heck of an arsenal to get invested into.-And many of these movements have such rawness to it, a destructive bout of shots and editing to really give you everything action junkies want in a movie with such a hardened lead.-This is where the sound and cinema work the most. Not in the beautiful shots of emotional wellness, or the beautiful backdrop, and backdrops. .
-No, instead this time it's about pulling together and bringing the pure spectacle of elite ops vs. The world, and it accomplishes it in that Statham glory.The Emotional Fulfillment
-There are those movies that know how to deliver that shot and moment that just screams full satisfaction.-To my surprise, the Beekeeper accomplished this for me, several of those moments captured in the perfect shot as the Statham gets that hit or kill that just makes you nod.-It adds a little more to the violence, gives some depth to his character without words, and helps to give this movie just that bit of depth that other films in this franchise lose when it's all about mediocre presentation.The Music
-A nice little mix of genres, the music has some comedic aspects and energy as Clay journeys on his quest for vengeance.-One part is song you will know, a blend of a lot of tracks that match the dynamic of the scene. While the other part is a typical Hollywood soundtrack of powerful instruments in the background to add that small oomph to the symphony of sound effects.DISLIKES:The Plot
-It's nothing special and quite linear, good on many levels, but will get lost in the sea of action films that we have.-There is little diving into most characters, it's quite lacking in terms of unique fervor, and the extra information just doesn't have the delivery that much of the John Wick series does.-It's not what most are going for, but... given some of the legendary actions films have a bit more meat to their, I can't say I wasn't disappointed not to have more to the story.It's Sort Of Ridiculous
-To an extent, all action movies are ridiculous.-But in this film, the movie's stunts are sometimes a bit too silly and extreme to not laugh and lose the respect and focus I had in the first part of the film.-Throw in the unbalanced strength factors in this movie being quite wider than I like to see and the movie just breaches a story that sort of lacks that organization I like to see in movies like these that have that balance of comic awesomeness and reality edge.Excessive Language
-By this point I've become desensitized, but the language is annoying at times to the point that again, there are better phrases and words to use.-The F and MF terminology is their bread and butter of the movie, so if you have a sensitivity for these words, avoid this movie at all costs or be ready expletive city.-It's lazy writing at times, but it sells, and at times they nail the timing and make it worthwhile.Some Violence Hard To Watch
-There are many moments that desensitized people like me can handle with no issues and laughing at the pure bliss of excitement.-And then there are some moments that are going to be hard, cringeworthy stabs, carving, and a few other means that are going to be hard to watch.-Though it doesn't hit the levels of Hostel or Saw, it may still be something to be wary of given some of the finishing moves Statham brings with it.An Element Of Action.-Mainly a lot of invincibility/superman complexes for much of the movie that can lead it to be a bit boring.-Wick, Olympus has Fallen, James Bond, and more take hits and come close to taking hits, which adds excitement, fun, and that danger sense.-The BeeKeeper though doesn't do this much of the movie, meaning the spectacle and finishes carry the excitement rather than the threat to our antihero. Had they cleaned that up a bit, it might have added even more to the mix.The VERDICT:
The BeeKeeper is a smash hit when it comes to the mindless action and fun of watching a one man army take out the bad guys. Very fast, very exciting, and holding enough merit to build a foundation that will give a meaning to the chaos and violence you are watching. Comedy helps add some pizazz to the mix, a little relief to the darker undertones that go well with the action. Add in the sense of justice and some engaging action that really helps this movie thrive and excel in the promised entertainment the trailers sent in their advertising. And with the simplicity comes the limitations of story, the stupid antics that are hyperbolic feats of super human levels, and some rather one sided antics that can be a bit stale. Throw in some hyper language use and some hard to watch moments, and you round out this movie to some Statham fun that is familiar, a tad stale, and dare I say a bit too familiar to be unique and engaging. Still, this one is worth a trip to the theater for just the fun times, and definitely one worth watching at home.My scores:
Action/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

Otherwise we will bring them to Justice; and take over the country until the UDHR has been manifested.The same applies to Israel, namely the oppressive Netanyahu regime; Netanyahu being responsible for the incitement that led to PM Yitzhak Rabin's 1995 assassination and sabotaging Peace Talks. Hence the Israeli government must end apartheid and the occupation of Palestine - by implementing Equality, International Law and Universal Suffrage.NB: Just like 2,500 years ago - during the Iron Age - tyrants, fanatics and evildoers still clobber each other over the head, aiming to exert dominance and slavery over each other; in particular guys like Ali Khamenei, Netanyahu and the mad Putin regime, which is very disappointing. Hence we must finally all work together to manifest World Peace and the UDHR.But no worries, if all else fails, I'll take over these countries - as the current President of the Middle East, UK, Russia and United States.NB: The Putin regime is responsible for the killings of Human Rights Defenders and critics of the corrupt and evil egime; such as Alexei Navalny.

I just can't help but love to see him kick some ass. It's by no means like a John Wick 4 or any other mind blowing action movie of today's time with its directing and sequences but it's not the worst I've seen either!

But then, when something bad is done to someone in his neighborhood by an evil gangster who is untouchable by the justice system, it turns out that he is an ex-special forces. Although he has sworn never to kill again, he decides to release the killer in him once again in order to get rid of his neighbor, who we only saw on the screen for 3 minutes. Unstoppable and without really experiencing any serious resistance or being injured, he now fights his way to the final boss, who he gives a beating. Sounds familiar? Yes, because that feels like the story of every single Jason Statham movie!!!!!","

"The Beekeeper","blueycrter","5 February 2024","There has been a long line of John Wick copy cats e.g. The Wrath of Man and Mr Nobody: i.e. Emotional inciting incident brings professional killer out of retirement to get revenge. With hidden lore and a secret society.This is the worst possible version of those.The inciting incident is contrived, the dialogue between Jason Statham and the old lady feels like they are reading their scripts for the first time. The scamming scene is a little Wolf of Wallstreet cliche, but its probably the best scene in the movie.. then the emotional impact of the lady's death is completely ruined by Jason Statham being surprised by FBI daughter. Also why would the lady kill herself before getting help from her FBI daughter...The rest of the movie is just action action action... but I was yawning throughout. 20 years ago the choreography would be passable, but it isn't doing anything exciting or original. It's not gritty or impressive or believable. It never feels like Statham is ever in danger, or has to put any effort in. About 50 times, a 'bad guy' has a gun aimed at him, and doesn't shoot. Its cliche after cliche. ""Jason Statham ran this way - Freeze!"" turns out it's a different bald man in the same suit. I'd rather be forced to watch every episode of One Piece at 0.25x speed than learn more about beekeeper lore, it's repetitive and doesn't make any sense.In conclusion David Ayer is a bad director who rushed every take, doesn't understand action, has bad taste in music and should consider a new career.... no offense. The producers should cut it down to 2 minutes and use it as a PSA about the dangers of internet scammers.","

"The Beekeeper","GreatorexLee","17 January 2024","A a really, really fun film. What I love about The Beekeeper is it feels like a genuine classic action b-movie. The odd dialogue and clunky changes in tone never feel forced or like satire of classic action b-movies. Instead it's a genuinely idiosyncratic movie that provides possibly unintentional comedy along with some great action scenes.I had so much fun watching this and will definitely be buying the DVD when it's out. The perfect movie to watch with a few beers. Some classic clunky social commentary just like many of the second tier action movies of the 80s and 90s. Some fantastic villains too although I would have loved to have seen much more of at least two of them.Good cast! Josh Hutcherson is great in this whilst Jeremy Irons and Minnie Driver are essentially pointless but add character to this strange but highly enjoyable movie.","

"The Beekeeper","axeman_z","19 January 2024","There are lots of action movies that gets released but few that are worth watching. This is one of the ones worth watching. It's not an incredibly deep story/premise, but it is a good story that you wish were real, and yet another film that elevates Jason Statham (again) as the most reliably good action movie star of the last 20+ years. Statham's performance, though never in a scene for extended amounts of time with any one actor save the agent, elevates all their performances for the story. Speaking of the story/mythology, it's as good or better than a certain franchise (looking at you Wick) and yet it probably won't see the endless number of sequels, if it even gets one. I highly suggest you go see the movie in theaters and enjoy it. This is a day one purchase for me when it's home release happens.","

It runs through the whole of this film with a modern and very relevant antagonist. They storyline of course is less believable in places but if you just want a good old fashioned action flick like some suggest a throwback to those in the 80's and 90's here it is. Films are meant to bring emotion, and I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in the cinema gave a little virtual fist pump as each odious baddie got their comeuppance.I titled this as 'much better than I expected' because the trailer came across like some sort of parody action film, yes the bee reference is a little comical at times but I think it fits, and overall if action is your thing like John Wick you'll leave the cinema with a sile on your face.","

"The Beekeeper","antoniotierno","13 January 2024","When Statham's tranquil life-in-retirement is shattered by the death-by-suicide, we start expectedly seeing the usual Jason's character. So he switches into vengeance mode. With beatings, explosions, gunplay and more. It's what happens in a Jason Statham movie. We're talking about genuine crowd-pleaser, action like in a live-action cartoon. No shades of gray here. There is obviously the risk of the whole thing getting and turning into a big cliché, leaving the sensation of a deja-vue. Bit going to much such a movie results in the risk of having to watch such a story, which is properly packed, on the whole.","

Loved the Transporter and Mechanic movies, was hopeful this would be on par but it fails in so many ways. There are some surprise actors in this other than Stathan like Jeremy Irons and Felicia Rashad. But others are just terrible actors and even come off as cartoony at times. Plus, like every other mainstream movie, they force diversity and it's too much. Female Beekeeper and main antagonist in the end are like something out of a Disney movie, or a bad movie from the 80's. Don't waste your $$ or time.","

Statham takes revenge in that film for what he needed so much and for which so many of us miss him. Pure highly entertaining action in a fine plot with even one last interesting twist when you thought everything was already served. He leaves a line of corpses and screwed people as long as the years he's been doing this.Fight choreography of the highest level and some in particular, like the last one, really very good and even the most credible.

"The Beekeeper","MiloSuperSpesh","5 February 2024","Dumb cringey bad guys trying to justify being bad guys is the order of the day, so if you love my previous mentioned comparisons you'll have an idea of what to expect.This movie is classic jason statham, his moves and prowess is on full display with minimal cut aways and stunt standins.Jason shows gun play close to keanu's and fighting off henchman like alan ritchinson's reacher.Acting- acceptable for most for what they had to work with, others are plain annoying ( head of the call centers and random pmc / henchmen, and oh boy the state of the blond highlighted foreign merc in a yellow jacket), Josh hutcherson goes for a less is more chill vibe, and jeremy irons just oozes coolness has he takes control of the situation.Music tries to be a unique flavour emmulating john wicks score fits well but isn't memorable.Effects - strictly mid nothing special or fancy just what is needed and does the job.Stunt work - quite alot of embelishment in perps flying around from kicks and explosions.Fights are pretty good with some really nice set pieces.Enjoy!","

The writer's mother should of washed out his mouth with a bar of Irish Spring deodorant soap when he was a child.The quality of dialogue is inversely proportional to the number of cuss words in a movie.I look forward to AI generated actors in a movie who would have replaced the terrible acting in this movie.The action was endless, the body count was high, some of the explosion scenes were entertaining but the whole premise of the movie was silly and unbelievable.","

"The Beekeeper","surfisfun","1 February 2024","Wow, Jason still kick ass in is mid 50s .The movie had me laughing out load on absurd violent moment a couple of times, i wisk they were more of those.The overall direction was so so , wt the main actress not charismatic and unappealing , like many actress recently cast in tuf roles. Her and her college are the worst 2 fbi agents cast ever.The script and dialogues where at times repetitive and uninspired. The editing also was not flowing well .The action was over the top, i liked some of it but i wish that when jason fighted large groups of people would have been tone down. Still , i loved some absurd ways some died.The Overall revange story was original, but i wish it would have been more critical of the world of USA politics and a better scripted ending.I guaranty a 99 % follow up to the Beekeeper as a cash action movie serial. Hopefully the writing and direction will be better.Another Wick style movie it is. Unrealistic one man agaist too many adversaries in scenes.","

"The Beekeeper","krowe33","13 February 2024","""A powerful and clandestine organization known as Beekeepers.""Of all the dumb clandestine organizations I have ever heard of in a movie, this one definitely takes the cake as the dumbest, with miles of distance between it and the second dumbest.The female FBI character in this is not only portrayed by an absolutely terrbile actress, but is also one of the most unbelievable characters I have ever seen in a movie. Not completely the actresses fault because whoever wrote the scenes for her character gave her dialog that is just so dumb, even a really good actress would have a hard time pulling the charcter off.The rest of the cast are not even worth mentioning. Let's just say they could have gone down the street grabbing pedestrians at random, and handed them the script for a 10 minute breeze through before putting them in front of a camera to act out their scenes, and the movie could only be better by doing so.The script is so terrible and corny even Stamos has a hard time being believable. But how could he? He's playing the role of a real beekeper, that raises actual honeybees, all while being in an organization called beekeepers that keep the bad guys in check. I get the feeling the entire crew were probably asking each other wtf behind the director's back.How this story made it's way into a movie just baffles me.","

"The Beekeeper","statuskuo","13 January 2024","I dunno, for me, the revenge plot will never get old. In this case Jason Statham plays a dude who gets triggered into action when the only lady who looked out for him gets offed and he goes into action. Have you ever noticed that these revenge films seem to take on an air of horror movies sometimes. Like baddies are sliced and diced away in horrific ways. The hero in this case, seems to be a supernatural entity that can't be killed.The term ""beekeeper"" in this sense means a few things. And writer Kurt Wimmer taps into the mentality of a bee hive. Suppose he got into a hobby and decided to draw parallels between the two. It gets absurd people.Director David Ayer has drawn a ton of fire for some mis-steps in the DC world, but in this world he works well. Everyone will compare this to John Wick. Which...I understand the framework looks similar but this is, to me, closer to ""The Equalizer"".The problem is that we know very little about the relationship between him and the catalyst for his vengeance. It's not catastrophic that he goes into action (a suicide). The ire falls on a party kid who is related to very powerful person. The issue is that his money is also the basis of how this powerful person got to where they are. Yes, the absurdity of the plot is very dumb. But, it's also not that serious.Statham is being pursued by the daughter of the woman who killed herself. Who also happens to be an FBI agent. Keep in mind, her Mother just committed suicide, and she's cracking wise with her partner. Fun as that may seem, it does feel odd.That said...who cares? It's silly. I mean, Jeremy Iron plays a former head of the CIA. He knows he's collecting a paycheck. As is Minnie Driver. And so forth. They know how camp this has to be.BUT, it's not campy enough. In my opinion, it needed to go full cartoon. And they try, with one last villain at the end who looks like a Street Fighter reject.This movie is wildly dumb but also...does have that so-dumb-it's fun.Turn your brain off and enjoy. Statham just likes wrecking havoc, busting chops and dispensing with comical bad guys in gruesome ways.","

"The Beekeeper","chand-suhas","21 January 2024","The entire plot got revealed in the trailer itself. Adam Clay (Jason Statham) plays the beekeeper, who knows to protect the hive. He is humbled by how Eloise Parker treats him. When Eloise gets scammed to lose all her savings, resulting in her death, the beekeeper makes it his mission to hunt down the ones responsible. From one company to another, following the money, the beekeeper remains unstoppable. How he uncovers the brains behind the scam and exact his form of justice forms rest of the story.In a way this can be called Jason Statham's own John Wick and 45mins into the film, they even show a glimpse of what could be the crazy Beekeepers world would be, if they make a sequel. It's a basic screenplay and David Ayer doesn't falter a bit in narrating an engaging story amidst all the action. It's over the top from the word go and a larger than life action star, carrying the film with his mere screen presence. Thought the reveal was predictable, the build up provided till the Boston fight scene and ofcourse the climax action scene, works well. The Beekeeper is a fun one time watch and a far better Jason Satham film since Wrath of Man.","

She appeared to force everything. Also, the writing for her character didn't help. They could have done a better job of showing her inner battle between being thankful for Jason and also trying to do her job. She made this movie go from a 10 to a 5. Jason did a great job as usual and the villains killed their roles. I feel like it can't be too hard to hire ex FBI agents to help make the parts seem a little more realistic. I did enjoy the movie once I got passed the female lead.","

"The Beekeeper","JoshuaMercott","18 February 2024","As heart-racing as it was entertaining, ""The Beekeeper"" saw Jason Statham once again delivering a high-octane action-hero performance that was memorable, thrilling, and suspenseful. He still has the ability to make the implausible feel credible.Statham played the role of a retired top-tier secret agent named Adam Clay who worked for a covert organization called The Beekeepers; from where the movie got its name. When someone he respected was harmed, Adam chose vengeance over forgiveness, and went to town on the individuals responsible.Though the story was anything but original, I loved how they put on quite the show and communicated a potent message about the strong protecting the weak. I liked the script's simple yet impactful approach. The story also showcased the negative near-unstoppable power malware still poses on our pro-tech society.Phishing was what led Adam on his path of vengeance after his kind-hearted friend and lessor Eloise was swindled by a shady company whose scams were linked to a bigger political game. After losing everything, Eloise had little choice but to commit suicide.So much of this is happening even today, making this theme in ""The Beekeeper"" supremely relevant. Heartless phishing is taking place all over the world and the idea lent this movie a wake-up-call vibe that I appreciated.Special shout-out to Eloise Parker (played by Phylicia Rashad), David Witts (as Mickey Garnett), Emmy Raver-Lampman (as Agent Verona Parker), Bobby Naderi (as Agent Matt Wiley), Josh Hutcherson (as Derek Danforth), Jeremy Irons (as Wallace Westwyld), Minnie Driver (as Director Janet Harward), and Jemma Redgrave (as POTUS Danforth).Though some of the tropes and dialogues in the movie were a tad aggrandized, in favour of the titular Beekeeper, the story managed to inform and entertain nonetheless. The team also cleverly wove in a few ""John Wick"" bounty elements, which stood well within the plot's parameters.The way the team connected scammers to corporations and government big-wigs was interesting, to say the least. They took theories that have been making the rounds for years and gave them an action-thriller twist with Statham at the helm.If only the world had real-life Adam Clays helping safeguard the 'hive'. Alas, such exemplary heroism seems only to exist in movies. ""The Beekeeper"" was one such story, and it was equally evocative and provocative.A sequel sounds like a buzzing good idea.","

"The Beekeeper","dbisseker","14 February 2024","Noticed the director in the opening credits and it made me even more excited to watched. David Ayre ! What a weapon. Everything he does I thoroughly enjoy.This was a no nonsense action flick based in today's current climate. Jason Statham plays.... same old, Jason Statham. No holds barred action from the start to the finish in this action packed, out for blood, revenge flick.Interesting characters that at times look like X men characters. This movie had a lot to like about it albeit predictable at times.I did NOT like the female FBI character, Verona. She was cringey and unbelievable. I didn't like her appearance or presence in the film. I get it meets today's expectations, casting certain genders in roles to meet quotas however I believe this movie could've done without her. There's no way she'd get through basic training let alone survive this far into the movie if it was realistic, but all that aside - she wasn't good.Very entertaining and impressive flick.Not much to think about.Just enjoy the action amongst the gunfire.","

The plot talks about the current issue of cybercrimes. This is an issue that needs more attention. There were great stunts and some comedy.

"The Beekeeper","movieman6-413-929510","14 January 2024","The Beekeeper is a new action thriller film from David Ayer, director of Fury and Suicide Squad.Adam Clay (Jason Statham) is a retired special agent of the secret organization called The Beekeepers. During his retirement, he rents a place to keep bees from old Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad).When Eloise is scammed online, she loses all her money and discovers her life. As a result, Adam goes after the online organization in revenge to stop them before they manage to scam other elderly people. Because of this revenge, Adam himself becomes a target of the FBI and he gets Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman) Eloise, her daughter, after him.With this action film they seem to be playing on the lame, entertaining action films from the 80s and 90s. Action actors like Sylvester Stallone's Arnold Schwarzenegger have to do exaggerated things to make someone blush, while making a silly joke. Furthermore, the film also plays on concepts from more modern action films such as John Wick where there are hidden organizations with special rules for mutual special agents.Despite these familiar aspects for fans of previous action films, the story of this film remains a bit rushed and bundled. Apart from the exaggerated, lame action parts, the film itself is sometimes a bit difficult to keep up with. If the writer had focused a little more on the imaginary story and used a little less different characters in the film, it could have been a little easier to follow. The message about the bad sides of scamming people online or with fake calls is somewhat lost.The effects don't always come across either. Some flames and explosions are not always clear, because the CGI is so clearly visible. Sometimes you can also see where they use pupae after the beekeeper ends his strong with his opponents.Jason Statham once again delivers suitable acting in the leading role of this action film. This is already the fifth action film he has made in a row in recent times. The rest of the film cast also delivers suitable work, but due to the more selected sides, most of them get few opportunities to really do something with their characters in the film.","

"The Beekeeper","Shaunmatthewc","17 January 2024","I really enjoyed this, I can't lie. Coming as an 80s action fan and following Statham's career since the early days of Snatch and the first Transporter film. His character in this befriends an old lady who falls for a phishing scam and kills herself.Then it's up to him to take revenge on everyone responsible with some of the most over the top ""Punisher like"" kills ever seen. There's something righteous about seeing these horrible people get their comeuppance which doesn't happen as much in real life unfortunately. Everyone in this acts well, the over the top Kiwi henchmen who pops up was hilarious.Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a good job as a couple of slimy villains. Emmy Raver-Lampman from Umbrella Academy is decent enough as an FBI agent trying to stop The Beekeeper. If you like old school action and don't need to be pummeled over the head with virtue signalling or any other messaging I would definitely recommend this. It's nice to see Statham bounce back with Meg 2 and this film after the abysmal Expendables 4.","

""Matrix, what have you left for us? Bodies.""But all the scenes without Jason, and first of all - the whole line with the FBI agent - complete garbage, she is pointless, pathetic, boring, and stupid dialogues in her performance - sound really stupid. Cut her character out of the plot - nothing would change, she doesn't participate in its development at all.Bottom line, if you somewhere near 40, Sly and Arny were your idols in childhood, and muscular men with a minimum of dialog, but a huge charisma warm your heart - it's safe to watch, especially skipping characters - fillers.","

"The Beekeeper","TheTruthofItIs","9 March 2024","""The Beekeeper"" (1/12/24, R, 100-min, $151M w/w, D/David Ayer) is a typical Jason Statham actioner where, as a retired ""BeeKeeper operator"", he wreaks vengeance upon those deserving of it. But his vengeance isn't a one-and-done event. He keeps attacking up the organizational ladder and the interesting twist in this is who's at the top of that ladder. Yes, he's a one-man army which gets kinda stupid as time goes on, but it's not terribly implausible. Josh Hutcherson co-stars against type as a douchey bad guy. Though he achieves his objective in the end, the actual ending is kind of inconclusive so that was a bit irritating which cost it another star for my review.","

Bad acting , bad script and the whole thing is making no sense for me to be honest
The character of verona is one of the worst written characters
They tried to make another version of john wick but this went so wrong.Also i don't know wtf is going on with all of these cops , i mean none of them can shoot with a gun ??? I know it's just a movie but not putting at least some logic on it is so annoying for me tbh

I do not know if this is the new normal, as I've seen a lot of this kind of poor acting in the recent years, but in my opinion, actors put little to no effort on the play. This is the case even for this movie. The screenplay seems to focus more on action and violence, leaving no space and time for things that would be normal in the logic of the movie, like the human relationship and sentiments, like the feelings of a daughter for her dead mom, or no positive feelings for the helping guy. All in all, you can laugh 2-3 times, but really, not any kind of emotion during or after watching this. Anyway it's watchable if you don't mind for the acting level.","

"The Beekeeper","AfricanBro","20 January 2024","The opening title sequence sets an intense and epic vibe, almost like a dark psychological thriller. This is an instant classic, instant! It's like if John Wick was the equalizer, but it's Jason Statham, who happens to have a fascination with bees and bee analogies. While I recently haven't watched Statham's best movies, this one compelled me to label it as some of his best work yet. But that's probably the adrenaline speaking. The fight scenes were both cool and intimidating, often laced with moments of humor as Statham toyed with his adversaries.The story was just okay, nothing spectacular even though the big bad was essentially the biggest big-bad; but to be honest the story's just a bonus, it's like a favor from the writers because the whole movie is really just Jason Statham engaging in relentless action, whooping butt. I think this is the first action movie of this sort I've enjoyed this much since the first two equalizer films with Denzel Washington.Now, my primary gripe lies in the lack of truly formidable antagonists-except for the Afrikaans dude, most of the villains felt rather lackluster in posing a challenge to Mr. Cray. A touch of additional villainous depth could have heightened the movie's tension. Bad guys could've been more bad ass. I always knew Mr cray was gonna win the next fight, it never felt like the stakes were high.Jason Statham undoubtedly shines as one of the finest action stars, showcasing his prowess in this film. Fifth movie in a year. I love how even though there's a few funny bits, they're not inherently comical; the main character has serious, no-nonsense demeanor, maintaining a dark and brutal persona throughout. The film wisely refrains from diluting this intensity with unnecessary jokes or lightheartedness. While not flawless-some minor issues with dialogue and acting in non-action segments-I highly recommend if you're an action fan. But even if you're not, because my sister had a blast with this too.Also there are no credit scenes, I googled but a couple websites seem to have it mixed up with Aquaman credit scene.","

It was painful to watch. To get from point A, this movie went all the way to Z, fast, without logic. The police was worse than stormtroopers. The bad guy, who needs Catniss once again to save him, I cannot even bring any more words to describe him. I wonder at times if actors are even ashamed of their work.

It was cringey-no chemistry at all with the partner; not sure how she got the role. She sure got over her mom's suicide pretty quick at the beginning. I always stay for every movie even watching credits to the end. This almost had me walking out. What happened to even ""B"" movies? This was a little entertaining but that was it.The last line of the movie was roll your eyes bad-he disappears in the water and the screen goes to credits and the lights come up-it was ""that's it, over, now get out""I always appreciate how we as individuals view film in our own way-I'm sure people really liked it but we all have opinions and this one was mine.

"The Beekeeper","ahmadmeisa","25 February 2024","Unfortunately i had to watch and complete thus movie in 3 days and i have not seen such a bad movie for years the story is very bad, Action is very very bad and the sound effects are just awful.My moral obligation forced me to write this review as i haven't seen such a bad movie for Jason Statham.And honestly this is the most bizarre nonsense illogical story and sequence if events i have ever seen in such movie types.And the rest of the crew their act is very bad, i am not sure why this movie was done and how can we be convinced that a group of mercenaries could be the guards of the president of USA this not making any sense.","

"The Beekeeper","edmond_melkomian","21 January 2024","I loved this movie. A vigilante taking revenge on the unscrupulous people who take advantage of senior citizens who have no knowledge of computers and combine that with shady political characters. Jason Statham shines in this movie. There isn't much dialogue, the line where he breaks into building and counts 1-2-3 for the security guard was a classic. The fighting and the fight scenes were really good. On the only negative side was that he got rid of the new beekeeper quickly and I also hope when they shot up the bee hives, they didn't actually destroy any. Overall a fun movie to watch and great action.","

"The Beekeeper","talllwoood13","6 February 2024","I saw this movie the other day and there were parts of it that were really well directed or written, however that ending was just poorly done. The casting was all over the place, it's like they had to find a balance between ""woke"" and hipster like casting. I hate the hairstyle that someone had to have agreed upon for ""Verona Parker"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman). Then of course the other bee keeper Jason Statham fights in the gas station just made me cringe. Just another person trying hard to embrace the 1980s style and culture but probably didn't grow up in it with her awful haircut, the jacket and anything else just made it look like they were trying too hard. However that was one of the best scenes in the movie without any doubt. In the call centers I would have rather Jason fly to ""South Asia"" and do all the destruction that he does over there as we all know where most of those scams are coming from! However language barriers and all that would be a bit difficult. Instead Jason barely drives across America. Maybe a state or two maximum and he just beats up or murders hipsters for the most part. Sure there are actual soldiers and everything but those call centers are mostly hipsters who the only time they have probably ever seen a firearm was playing Call Of Duty while they ate Doritos and drank Mountain Dew to be ""ironic"".The bad guys plot was horrible, we didn't need the 28 year old. However he played his role well to be that unlikable. I do feel Jeremy Irons should have been the actual bad guy instead. The worst thing that hipster looking kid probably did was forgetting to tip a waiter I'd look at him as. The second the movie got to the second call center it REALLY went downhill. Finally revealing how the mother got where she was and trying to link all these silly things together. It's like the movie ""The Painter"" which came out recently where the movie was good but the endings were awful. I even sat through until the end of the credits hoping we'd get a bit more but nope!The final fight was well done, it wasn't a one sided Steven Seagal fight. The fact that Jason was fighting against men he didn't intend to kill and shooting them in the body armor to knock them out was good. They even tried to implement bee facts in the movie as besides that the most we had was Jason tossing a jar of honey at someone. They had a few creative kills as well in this. I loved the bridge scene the most or when they are in the barn.The current rating of 6.5 is a perfect rating for this. It had a ton of potential to become a better movie but a different director and work on the script may have improved it. Who knows maybe in 2034 or 2044 there will be a remake. They've made them for lesser movies.","

"The Beekeeper","joeygvlahakis","18 February 2024","I'm a huge Jason Statham fan, i was lured in by the fantastic trailer. Statham and Jeremy Irons delivered strong performances, however in my opinion the plot lacked believability, resembling the introduction of John Wick in terms of a feared protagonist. It felt like an attempt to replicate the success of the John Wick franchise. Despite this, I see potential for redemption in a sequel. Regretfully, I should have waited for the movie to hit mainstream television to save some bucks. I'll give it another watch, hoping for a different perspective and anticipating improvements in a potential sequel.","

"The Beekeeper","KyleML222","15 January 2024","I am a big Jason Statham fan. Every year, I wait for a Good hard R Statham action movie. It's been a Few years since we got one of those. Wrath of man and Homefront are the most recent examples so it doesn't happen often. I have been waiting for this movie patiently but was cautiously optimistic. I was excited for this movie and I left the theatre satisfied. It's a good solid action film with a few creative set pieces. A few good kills and some good hand to hand combat. It isn't John Wick but it didn't need to be. Good throwback action movie. Not going to win any awards, but a good time at the movies!","

"The Beekeeper","darkreignn","14 January 2024","I am not a fan of David Ayer, but I am a fan of Jason Statham, and so - also being inspired by the positive reviews - I decided to drag my dad to the theatre with me to watch this movie. And on one hand, I enjoyed it as a Statham action vehicle; on the other hand, this film is chock-full of virtually every single David Ayer cliche that you can imagine.Is there near-constant cussing in this movie because of script writing that would make middle school students blush? Yes, there is. Are there a large number of ridiculous looking and absurdly dressed characters that you cannot envision being in anything other than an Ayer picture? Oh, you better believe it. And is there over-the-top violence that has absolutely no business being portrayed as anything that would remotely even take place in the realm of reality? Of course! It's all standard Ayer fare, and while I am not too much of a proponent of that, I found ""The Beekeeper"" to be as entertaining as it was thanks, in part, to those creative decisions.As much as I would've appreciated a more straightforward, grounded take on the action genre, I'd be lying if I said that the ludicrousness of it all wasn't entertaining, because it was. From the constant bee puns and the hilariously energetic villains that would give Jordan Belfort a run for his money to Statham's stoic and almost inhuman performance and all of the horror villain-esque violence that he delivers upon his enemies, ""The Beekeeper"" is straight-laced farce. This is a movie that's dumb, and knows that it's dumb, but plays itself as serious as humanly possible. Because of that, you'll find yourself laughing with the movie while also finding a great deal to enjoy from the action sequences.""The Beekeeper"" features Statham at his most brutal, perhaps ever, employing a range of tactics that dispatch the film's villains in increasingly violent manners. Statham is a force to be reckoned with here, more akin to The Punisher than John Wick, and it really works. It's all very silly, but the brutality is fitting, especially since the villains are so despicable. You really want to see the villains get what's coming to them, and you get that through a series of action sequences that are each more elaborate than the next. I cannot emphasize enough how stupid the movie is, but I also can't emphasize enough how fun it is to watch on the silver screen.I am still not a fan of David Ayer after watching this movie, but I am impressed about how entertaining ""The Beekeeper"" managed to be. As I said, I would've preferred a more gritty, serious action movie than this was, but for what it was, this was fun, and I will definitely be adding this to my physical media collection.","

"The Beekeeper","jonwade","31 January 2024","I enjoyed Beekeeper - the same way you enjoy a 1980's straight to video action flick. In places it was unintentionally hilarious.The accents of what seemed to be the mostly British cast were fantastic - American one moment - English the next - with Jeremy Irons appearing to be the first Brit ex head of the CIA before taking a stab at an American drawl later on in the movie.The fight scenes were good - the twisteroo with the bad guys mum was good.But the absolute pinnacle was the South African hit man Lazerous. Wonderful stuff - chewing the scenery from second one. The Stath had no problem identifying Lazerous' team in a crowded building as they were all dressed like extras in an MC Hammer video.Did enjoy it - had a good laugh - but it is not great.","

"The Beekeeper","josejmaacc","3 February 2024","A previous writer for Fast-X is intolerant to spices, however he went to an Indian restaurant and then to a Mexican restaurant, between all the vomiting and diahrea he wrote this movie script. After that he invited the producer and director, they live far far away and traveled in a plane that leaked lead from enriched lead fuel into the cabin, with the same brain capacity as an amoeba they evaluated the script and opinated about its greatness. The same plane was used in all the camera operators, stunt actors, advisors, everyone , everyone was using that plane all the time.When the camera man is filming Jason and include 20 other fighters 1 meter away fromhim that are doing nothing, well, remember the fumes.I would like to points out that I can not explain the consistency between scenes but I think the diahrea is very very similiar.",NA
