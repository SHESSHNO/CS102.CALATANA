"Joker","TVpotatoCat","15 October 2019","There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.","

"Joker","Xstal","12 April 2023","Arthur Fleck's a guy with lofty aspirations, wants to make you laugh and disturb your foundations, although, he's not really that funny, he ain't going to make much money, so before you start, curtail your expectations; unlike Arthur, you won't be having laughing fits, as he aspires to get some television glitz, dispatches tormentors with glee, it's a substantial, hefty fee, but I guarantee, it won't leave you in bits; although, if schadenfreude's your thing you might just chuckle, but if it's not, the story may just make you buckle, as those on, the lower rungs, tend to not have, that much fun, and quite often, from the day they learned to suckle.","

"Joker","Aman_Goyal","1 September 2019","Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.","

"Joker","Come-and-Review","1 September 2019","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.","

"Joker","VallejoDiego","4 October 2019","Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director","

Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.","

"Joker","RayCharles81","7 October 2019","Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.","

"Joker","logical_guy","1 September 2019","Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime","

"Joker","ernestoherreraf","25 October 2019","When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.","

"Joker","Red_Identity","11 October 2019","What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.","

"Joker","postofficecb","30 May 2020","They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise.","

"Joker","Hitchcoc","7 March 2020","While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,
they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.","

"Joker","saveliydalmatov","2 January 2024","This is probably one of the most successful examples of a gorgeous solo film about some popular character.The Joker was played by the inimitable Joaquin Phoenix (known for his role in Gladiator), and people comparing him to Ledger are very narrow-minded, because Phoenix showed us a completely new Joker, who is gorgeous in his own way.The plot tells about a sick man Arthur, who suffers eternal ridicule over himself, lives and cares for his mother, and also dreams of being accepted by people, thanks to his performance on Murray's favorite humor show (De Niro)
As a result, we will see a man becoming a monster because of our society, of course not without his mental illness, but the nature of people clearly pushed the main character to become a Joker.This is a gorgeous dramatic thriller, with some cool reference for the future (little Bruce, Thomas Wayne, etc.), which is a must-watch!

This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director.

OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake.

"Joker","Nhirscher","4 October 2019","In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.","

In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.","

"Joker","cherold","5 January 2020","In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it.","

Yes, Phoenix's portrayal of his character was riveting. Yes, the story was both gripping and also necessary, especially today when it seems that mental illness is running rampant. Yes, the tone was magnificently set within both the cinematic and art direction.What I have a problem with, is the way it tied into the Batman universe and particularly with what it had in common and what differentiated it from the
Jokers of the past. I still have problems making the two worlds merge.","

"Joker","Davor_Blazevic_1959","6 October 2019","Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.","

"Joker","sherylchilders82","15 November 2023","As a bleeding heart liberal and a person who also suffered from mental illness, I often detest stereotyping and simplified portrayals of both ""the disenfranchised"" and the mentally ill. But, despite the tropes and unrealistic nature of the Joker, this made excellent fiction. I think that if you interpret it though symbolism rather than taking it literally, that is where the message really lies.The thing this film adds to the modern DC universe is a truly empathetic story from a villain's perspective - the Joker. DC seems to be the jaded dark and Marvel the innocent Disney light. Don't get me wrong - I love Disney, but DC really balances it out.Of course you have to mention Phoenix, who won Best Actor for this role. We go from cringing and wanting to run away from this character, to sort of rooting for him by the end. Even though I'm just watching this in 2023, I remember everyone talking about his dance on the steps - so delightful. He's actually a good dancer lol. But, it's really at that point that you appreciate this origin story.There could be a lot to rip apart in this movie. While the elements and feelings ring of true representation, no literal interpretation would hold up. That's why I classify this as horror, which is historically full of metaphors and smoke and mirrors for deeper darker themes. It's why I don't get mad for any innuendo someone that doesn't understand mental illness or oppression might take from this. Because if you're trying to find reality in horror, you aren't getting the point.I think that underneath it, everyone can relate to the cruelty of the world and this darker part of you that wants to see someone pay for the unfairness. It's why we can empathize and laugh at the dance. If you don't get that, you must live a pretty charmed life. It's why we watch horror and love to hate violence. Denying this aspect of human nature is asking for trouble. This is the message of Joker. And, actually, it's a pretty universal bipartisan message.","

"Joker","paul_haakonsen","10 November 2019","Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't. It wasn't all that particularly outstanding or entertaining. Sure, it is a movie about an iconic villain in the DC universe, but that is about as far as it goes.I am rating this overhyped and overrated movie a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.","

"Joker","bradenmueller","10 February 2024","'The Joker', a cinematic exploration of the darker corridors of society, delves into the complexities of mental health and societal neglect. The film's narrative structure is a masterpiece of storytelling, gradually unraveling the psyche of its protagonist, Arthur Fleck. His transformation into the Joker is not just a character arc; it's a disturbing mirror held up to society's failings.The thematic depth of 'The Joker' is where its true strength lies. It does more than just tell a story; it ignites a conversation about mental health in America, echoing sentiments familiar to followers of The Anarchist Symbol and Cercle Proudhon. The film's portrayal of a society that both creates and then shuns its monsters is a powerful commentary on the cyclical nature of neglect and violence.From a technical standpoint, 'The Joker' is a triumph. The cinematography masterfully captures the gritty, oppressive atmosphere of Gotham City, serving as a backdrop to Fleck's descent into madness. The score, haunting and melancholic, perfectly complements the film's tone, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.As a fan of The Anarchist Symbol and Cercle Proudhon, one can't help but appreciate the film's raw depiction of anarchic chaos as a response to societal breakdown. It's a stark reminder of the consequences of ignoring the marginalized and the mentally ill. The film doesn't glorify this chaos but presents it as an inevitable outcome of a society that fails to address its deepest issues.The portrayal of the Joker himself is a testament to the complexities of the human mind. His actions, while extreme and morally reprehensible, are depicted with a level of empathy that forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about the human condition and societal responsibility.In conclusion, 'The Joker' is a film that not only entertains but also challenges its audience. It's a bold statement on mental health, societal neglect, and the thin line between sanity and madness. The film might not offer solutions, but it undoubtedly sparks a necessary dialogue, making it a must-watch for those who dare to confront the darker aspects of our society.","

"Joker","davestroud-76036","4 October 2019","This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.","

"Joker","villard","18 January 2020","I'm dumbfounded this film gets such a high IMDB rating.If this was meant to be some kind of social commentary on the ravages of mental illness, it could have been done without hijacking one of the most colorful characters in the Batman comic book genre.Viewers are held hostage to two hours of somber, relentless depression, murder, and mayhem. There are endless shots of a solitary, anguished Joaquin Phoenix, which get pretty monotonous.In a nutshell: adopted boy suffers brain damage from a brutal father, lives with a sick mentally ill mother, and, after getting beat-up by street hooligans, builds a self-pitying clown alter-ego that's going to hold up a mirror to a dismissive society. *Yawn*Of all the actors who have played Joker, Heath Ledger got the right balance of being a scary, crazed, murderous, diabolically clever sociopath who could go toe-to-toe with Batman. The pathetic, hapless Phoenix character lacks all of that persona.Yes, Phoenix does an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar. But that alone doesn't save a film that is a boring flop because it is monotone, dark, dour, and mostly pointless.","

"Joker","SnoopyStyle","26 November 2019","Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on.","

"Joker","g_bake","4 October 2019","Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.","

"Joker","Horst_In_Translation","5 November 2019","This is ""Joker"", a 2019 movie and the title is really telling what/who it is about. But first things first: The director is Todd Phillips and he is also one of several writers working on the screenplay for this 2-hour movie. Phillips is still mostly known for his Hangover films probably and in general for his collaborations with Zach Galifianakis. So gently-speaking, the filmmaker's career is not exactly filled with projects that were received greatly by critics. This one here is no exception either. General movie-goers apparently really loved it, but critics not so much. A bit like Bohemian Rhapsody not too long ago. That one I really adored though, this one here not so much. Still I am a big Joaquin Phoenix fan and as such, it is impossible to give the film a thumbs-down overall. He is the movie. And I am really glad he plays the title character because otherwise I maybe would not have liked it at all. Not just because of personal preference, but also because Phoenix really is that good from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene. Not too long ago, Jared Leto played the Joker (Batman's nemesis) and there was a lot of hype surrounding his turn that quickly vanished because he really did not have too much screen time at all and stayed pale in comparison to Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. But let's not drift away from this film here now. For Phoenix, all the hype is justified and well-deserved. I think he is still up there and a potential contender for the Oscar win this year with his nomination pretty much a safe deal and I read that it could be between him and Adam Driver and I like both for being slightly oddball, so I certainly approve. Of course with stuff like Her, The Master and my personal favorite Walk the Line under his belt, it is arguable if this one here should be the movie for which he gets a golden statuette, but I still hope he does. If we consider Daniel Day-Lewis retired now, he is probably the best actor working right now and as he is still under 50, that is quite impressive. At least in my opinion, but he is just so consistent and constantly adds depth to his characters in a way where you feel nobody else could have done it this well. He does so much with his eyes. Okay you get the message, I thought he was an amazing Joker.Sadly I cannot say the same about the film itself really. There are good moments here and there, no denying at all, but I was still not satisfied with the script I must say. It felt to me that, most of all, they were taking the safe route basically and going the way where it would obviously be a crowd pleaser, but somehow I must say that the film felt zero daring to me. Even the interactions with the Wayne family that could easily really have been goosebump material, felt a bit shoddy and for the sake of it all. I did like, however, that the way things seemed to turn out we thought it would definitely be the Joker who kills Bruce's father in the end because of the personal connection, but it was just one of his ""army"" eventually and it does not matter who did it. Joker is not really getting his hands dirty at that point anymore, he has others who do so for him. Also pay attention to how everybody who means something to him early on (his mother, De Niro's character most of all) are killed by him. I must say I did wonder though how they did not try to catch him after he strangles his mother. I mean as for the colleague at his apartment, it made more sense because the time between that and the show appearance was perhaps too short. But still the cops were following him and that was accurate. There, however, Clownmania was already going on in full force you could say. Big enough though for police not to go to the studio and arrest him right away? I would say I disagree.In general, this is a film where you can never really be sure how much of it is real and how much just happens in the protagonist's head. Like his relationship with the neighbor, but that is just the obvious one where we know it is fake, even if I did not see it coming. Of course also the relationship between his mother and Mr. Wayne (okay that seemed fairly far-fetched from the beginning, I mean Joker cannot be Batman's half-brother can he?) or the medical condition he has in terms of laughing or the idea about De Niro's character early on almost acting like a father figure to him in front of the camera, which most likely was fake too because there were no references later on that it was not his first time on the show. So this is a film that will certainly play with your head continuously because the only moments you can be 100% sure they are real and actually happening are those that include a great deal of violence, such as the killing of the three young men on the subway. Or the talk show host murder. Or the killing of his mother? Or maybe is that fake too? I mean it is a big step, even if she did invent the relationship with Bruce's dad. He really really cares for her. And he won't kill the colleague who always treated him well. I thought it was a psycho trick that he left the door closed and the guy is too small to reach the knob/key, but no he really just forgot it and lets him go eventually. He is a psychopath yes, but with his very own unpredictable style. Of course, there are aside from that these moments with all the over-the-top laughing, most notably when he visits the comedy show and laughs each and every time everybody else stays quiet and stays quiet himself when they are laughing at the punch lines. Now that was kinda hilarious because of how awkward it felt and also very telling because we saw how he totally did not fit in with everybody else, the average people.Okay, I think this would be pretty much all then. I mentioned some of the scenes that stayed most memorable to me. Maybe, most likely, you have different scenes that fit the description for you and that is perfectly fine because there are so many to pick from. There is hardly one that is really weak and I think the running time was accurate too and I don't say that too often about 2-hour movies that they should not have kept it a bit shorter on some occasions, so you can see it as a compliment. But like I mentioned previously already, those scenes that did stand out mostly did so because of Phoenix giving it his best and not really because of great writing. I think the dialogue writing was still a bit better than the writing of the action and what the characters were doing compared to saying, which sometimes made me forgot about the relatively weak ways in which the story was progressing. This also applies especially to the idea of everybody getting more and more crazy out there somehow. There is a fairly memorable quote from Fleck (Joker in his ""human form"") about that that they really could have made a lot with (also they included it in the trailer) story-wise, but the way they included the clown army for example felt really out of nowhere and it did not make too much sense to me. Okay we get it. Gotham is not at a good place to be right now, but with such a movement you just have to come up with a better explanation and elaboration and lead us there more convincingly. Okay that would be all then I liked and disliked about this film. It certainly won't make it into my top10 movies of the year and if it gets in at the Oscars for Best Picture, that is too much I think, but I wish Phoenix all the luck he can have for upcoming awards season because his turn here can really be described as greatness. There was always a lot of arguing about who's the best Joker. Nicholson? Ledger? Hamill? Romero? There is definitely a new name that can be added to the discussion now. All in all, the film gets a thumbs-up from me.","

"Joker","piecookie","20 October 2019","I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don't buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta ""standup"" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.
Is this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.","

"Joker","bob the moo","16 August 2020","Low expectations and subverted expectations play a big part in this film's success, although not the biggest part. The levels of expectation on a DC 'universe' film is now pretty low - to the point that someone with film OCD like myself has not bothered to even dip a toe in recent years; likewise what one expects from a superhero genre origin story is not something like this. The sense of pleasant surprise certainly helped the success of the film, but it is not the main thing.The main reason is the central performance of Phoenix. He is totally committed to selling his character throughout, and even in the weakest moments of narrative, you believe his character in terms of its roots, development, and actions. It is not a film that would normally be associated with awards, but it would be a significant failure were he not to be recognized for how much he delivered and how much he made the film. A secondary reason the film works is its cinematic heritage in the films of Scorsese in so much as it falls between Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. This is not accidental, and the casting deserve a lot of credit of getting actors of the quality of Phoenix and de Niro (although the latter does more as a reference than an actor). With these elements working well, the film produces an engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting the character. I could have done with it stopping just a few seconds earlier than it did, because I'm not sure that the ""maybe it was all imagined"" bit at the end was a good idea.Otherwise, it is enjoyably dark and deliberate, and is driven by Phoenix, even if the film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe.","

My main bone of contention with this film is that it really doesn't need to be tied up to the whole superhero genre, setting up the rivalry with Batman for at least half the running time; it's a better film than that and would have served better as a stand-alone psychological portrait of mental breakdown. Films this seems to have been inspired by include THE MECHANIC, THE KING OF COMEDY and of course TAXI DRIVER.","

"Joker","NpMoviez","15 October 2019","DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+","

"Joker","harkap","9 January 2020","Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing","

"Joker","januszlvii","23 May 2020","Is Joker the worst comic book movie I ever saw? Oh yes beating Batman and Robin.( Phoenix surpassed the worst comic book performance of all-time by Alicia Silverstone ( Batgirl)). Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to get the movie, but I found it unpleasant ( except for the Sinatra music and the setting). I do not care for Arthur/Joker and did not have one speck of sympathy for him Why? For one his goal is not to make things better, it is about anarchy ( unlike say what we saw in V is for Vendetta). Spoilers ahead: Who people should feel for is young Bruce Wayne who sees his parents murdered in cold blood in front of him. There is nothing funny about seeing a child orphaned. As far as movies are concerned, I enjoyed Ledger and Nicholson as Joker, and I also liked him in comics and cartoons. Why? He is the perfect counterpoint to Batman, and vice versa.. Batman almost never laughs and Joker ( rarely) cries. This is a movie of hopelessness and depression, that makes you feel things cannot possibly get better. While Batman is the Dark Knight and that name alone says he not a fun loving character with wisecracks like Spider-Man, his presence in Gotham City gives hope of a better future ( something not seen in Joker). A very unpleasant experience that got me angry. I did not like the movie. 0/10 stars.","

His facial expressions and his creepy laugh will haunt you forever. The build up of his character from an isolated abused man to a serial killer is stunning to watch. The movie director knows precisely what he is doing, you are always left in suspense never knowing when the joker will burst on camera. You really feel this is a true story. The gore lever is managed perfectly for each scene, not too much, not too little. The blurred lines between reality and the joker's imagination is perfectly shown with clever editing and music management.. All the scenes are dark, the colors and grayish, to keep you in the mood of the story.","

"Joker","ahmetkozan","13 November 2019","Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is ""the rise of the Joker!"" 10/10","

"Joker","classicsoncall","29 October 2019","Right out of the gate you can forget about considering this a comic book movie. It may be based on a comic book character, but the character development and story line can be taken right from the pages of modern day horrors brought about by poverty, abusive parents, disrespect for authority, the distance between the haves and the have-nots, and an uncaring society at large. With a plot often times structured on ambiguity, the film explores the troubled mind of one Arthur Fleck, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in what may eventually go down as the crowning achievement of his acting career. No offense intended to Jokers who have gone before, but Phoenix's take on the character now becomes the standard for others to follow, but virtually impossible to match. I must say, the hype engendered by the film prior to it's release relative to the amount of violence portrayed appears to be seriously overstated. Yes, there is violence on Arthur Fleck's part, all of it gruesome, but it virtually pales in comparison to what one might experience in any chapter of the 'Saw' series for example, or any number of slasher/gore flicks that rely on buckets of blood to 'entertain' fans of that persuasion. Together, director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have created a complex character and a complex film dealing with the horrific and sordid side of mental illness that finds it's release in savage, sociopathic behavior. Though he may be called the Joker, as Arthur Fleck himself would surely attest, ""...no one's laughing now"".","

I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!","

The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We're talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I'd see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a ""thrill park ride"". Now that doesn't mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don't compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is!

"Joker","ivo_shandor","28 September 2020","Great, but could have been even better. It was almost there. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic and definitely deserves his long overdue Oscar nomination. It's one of the more interesting DC films out there. There are a lot of great sequences and moments that define Phoenix's version of the Joker; you can feel the tension and creepiness in almost every scene. The cinematography is fantastic, as is the look of Gotham City. It actually feels more like Gotham than the Nolan movies. The one detriment of the film is that it is Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy almost beat for beat. While it is inspired by the films of Scorsese, it feels like it's just copying it straight out. If it were altered from Taxi Driver, but still kept the same slow burn, it would have been just as great. It is an interesting take on the Joker, but the fascination with his character is the mystery, and having his own film will always feel unnecessary. It does deserve credit though, for being different and trying to do it's own thing. Phoenix's costume and mannerisms are fantastic, and I like its homage to Cesar Romero. While it could use some light editing and a few changes to the ending, the film works for the most part, but it's overall goal seems a little unclear. A lot of people seemed to be unsure of the message of the movie, but it feels more like it's up to your own interpretation. It felt like you have to look at it from a certain point of view. Depending on how you look at it, some stuff will work and some won't. I'm a sucker for gritty crime films, gangster movies, and the Joker himself, so if you're a fan of the character and those types of film, it's for you. It is very unique, great production design, great look to everything, and a noteworthy take on a fun character, especially in its ending. It's worth seeing, and I hope it gets a few Oscars.","

"Joker","bwkuettel","4 March 2024","What a genius move it was to make a dark, well acted, character driven psychological thriller and Trojan horse it into theaters with the superhero movie connection by making it a stand-alone Joker origin story. While the beginning is a bit scripty, the movie becomes brilliant as it goes along by commenting on the importance of mental healthcare and how a very troubled individual can easily break and be a danger to society, but in this case indirectly harnessing people's frustrations at the corrupt elites of the world, or Gotham City, to become an unintentional icon of anarchy as he does by the end. Joker is interestingly the anti-Batman origin story, the other side of that coin.Joker recalls the greatest modern psychological thrillers like Fight Club, Nightcrawler, and American Pyscho with its incisive indictment of modern society and invoking that rousing feeling in the viewer to wake up, snap out of your everyday life, and think for yourself. Themes that have been done before and may seem obvious at first, but conveyed in an intimate manner through the eyes of a true psychopath in waiting. Like the aforementioned films, Joker will be especially impactful for empaths and disappointed idealists. It's ironic that the movie's pre-release controversy was about fears of it emboldening right-wing gun nuts and possibly causing city riots or something, when the entire movie ends up being about how crucial healthcare and competent city governance is!Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances of his career (which is saying something) and elevates the already solid screenplay with his brilliant acting. Certainly not in line with modern superhero movies, more akin to a classic Martin Scorsese crime film than a big budget Hollywood blockbuster, Joker is something special and Phoenix provides another brilliant performance as the iconic villain after Jack Nicholson and of course Heath Ledger.","

"Joker","statuskuo","19 October 2019","No one will ever say Joachin Phoenix didn't give his all, but if you watch enough loner-with-an-agenda film such as ""King Of Comedy"" or ""Taxi Driver"" you know where the pieces will fit.
The other thing is that the message of how society, in its neglect for the mentally ill will cause a rift in a population that is sick and tired of being sick and tired. In this case, where you identify with is where the Joker can get you. And empathize for what he must do. An achievement in making the unintentional sociopath that we see in all the movies. It's not without its charm. Granted, these dark misanthrope characters never bothered me...call me a dark person...there are sly nods at what is to be (a young Bruce Wayne sliding down a playset pole to greet Fleck was an especially nice one).
The other thing is what is known as anachronistic music and movies. Okay...having Cream and Gary Glitter and having Charlie Chaplin is no longer an alternate universe. It means Gotham is real and it kept having to readjust my mind that it wasn't New York City circa 1981. They either know our pop culture evolution or you don't.
The other thing...is that it still raises so many questions as to the Joker's history. A simple one of emotional betrayal by those he held close but can't exhibit closeness isn't going to work. The betrayal is meaningless. Which, unfortunately, is the ugliness of The Joker.
Who do you root for here. Thomas Wayne, the future tyrant capitalist, unwavering in a modicum of kindness who is a victim of rampant unrest between the rich and poor. Or the Joker, a product of the most sludge scraping bottom who does very little to further his lot in life other than to report to a menial job while being medicated to death? It's all ugly and there are no sunshine. That is NYC today...I mean Gotham. It's a perverse film that sets up larger ideas that seem to fizzle into an unnecessary overbearing notes of ""gee, isnt the music so different than what we see"" territory. Todd Phillips does an excellent job at capturing the time but look...it's either reality or it's not.","

"Joker","BandSAboutMovies","21 November 2019","Why does this movie exist? Who does it exist for? Why do people love it so much?These questions reverberated inside my head as it played in front of me. I was waiting for a moment where I would be awestruck, blasted by its sublime genius that so many people had trumped up or maybe even worried by the philosophy that so many people were worried about.I felt absolutely nothing.Joker might seem like a good movie if you've never seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. But here's my struggle. Those movies have something to say. Something to prove. They aspire to be art when this film is simply commerce.If you think this is a good film, tell me what it has to say. Tell me the meaning of it and why it exists other than, ""The Joker is cool"" or ""This is the Joker's origin story."" What is the purpose of watching a man's horrible life that never gets better and only gets worse and then the lives he touches get destroyed along the way.I mean, is it a cliche to use that sound and fury signifying nothing quote when this movie is so rote that it uses the song ""White Room"" in perhaps the most obvious of ways? Nothing is unexpected. Nothing is unique. This movie is the definition of wallpaper, albeit wallpaper bought by a tween at Hot Topic because they desperately yearn for something, anything, to make them seem different than the herd while mooing their way through the fields of utter boredom.Director Todd Phillips started his career by directing Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies while he was still a junior at NYU. His second film, Frat House, won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance before HBO bought it. It never aired, as many of the film's participants claimed they were paid to enact the scenes in the movie.A third film, the Phish-following Bittersweet Motel, was his last documentary before making the movies Road Trip and Old School for producer Ivan Reitman. His career since has been a series of successes, like Starsky & Hutch, School for Scoundrels, Due Date and The Hangover series.Which brings us to this movie.It's written by Scott Silver, who wrote 8 Mile - good - and X-Men Origins: Wolverine - bad. He also wrote The Fighter, which won him an Oscar nomination.I always feel like you should say something nice first.So here's goes.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is great. It's acting desperately searching for a better movie to be in. His goal was to play a character that audiences couldn't identify with - that seems odd for the main role in a movie - studying assassins instead of people who had played the Joker before.He plays Arthur Fleck, who starts out the film as a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother Penny (Francis Conroy, every season of American Horror Story). A disorder causes him to laugh out loud for no reason and he depends on the government for his meds.An attack while working as a clown leaves him needing a gun, a gun that falls out of his pocket while working in a children's hospital. He also begins dating his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beats, who was in Deadpool 2 and Slice) and finds that a video of him on stage has gone viral, ending up on his favorite TV program, The Murray Franklin Show.The fact that Robert DeNiro is inversing his The King of Comedy role, playing Jerry Langford instead of Rupert Pumpkin, is the type of creativity normally reserved for college freshmen who believe they are the first people to ever read Herman Hesse.Arthur is beaten up by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen. He shoots two of them in self-defense before feeling so good about himself that he kills the third. This leads to Thomas Wayne - who Arthur's mother believes is her son's father - denouncing whoever did this killing as a clown.Soon, people are rioting in the streets wearing clown masks and Arthur is finally feeling like his life has meaning. However, two Gotham cops visit his mother, looking for the killer of the businessmen, and she has a stroke. This causes Arthur to either go off the deep end or become sane, as his meds have run out. He realizes that he has no girlfriend and that everything in his mind has been a lie.This brings him to The Murray Franklin Show, where he embraces the name The Joker, inciting another riot that also leads to Joe Chill killing the Waynes inside Crime Alley after a showing of Zorro The Gay Blade. Yes, that really happens.Another potentially crazy person was angered by this movie. Jared Leto, who portrayed the Joker in Suicide Squad and reportedly sent used condoms and dead rats to his co-stars, was alienated and upset by the fact that Warner Brothers was making a Joker movie without him. He even left his agents over this and attempted to get people to cancel this movie.I've heard words like groundbreaking and Oscar being thrown about because of this movie. As a society, we've really devalued those two words, huh?This is a movie that may not even be about the real Joker. It might not even connect to anything. And it's a movie about a man forgotten and thrown away that becomes somebody before being nobody. It's also a waste of two hours of your time.Man, I should work in some other nice things. The cinematography feels large in scope, when so many other films seem small these days. I also loved seeing the old Warner Brothers logo.I mean, this won the Gold Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It also had an eight-minute long standing ovation.I sat there waiting, hoping, struggling to find one moment of entertainment and relevance and walked away saying, ""That was a movie."" It should be something more.Instead, I'll have to see people wearing this costume and thinking it has some significance. These are the same people who think naming the comedy club ""Pogo's Comedy Club"" is daring because it references John Wayne Gacy instead of hammer soft irony.We deserve better and have become so mired in the dross that we think that movies like this are worth something. I'm not being an elitist - I love popcorn films and if you read this site you know I have a soft spot for Italian horror and 80's slashers - but when I see something that is s***, I have to call it the purest s*** I've seen in years.","

You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema.

Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!","

"Joker","PayPal-Gift-Card","24 February 2024","This was a major surprise for me. It was more than simply a comic book character's origin story: it was a brutally dark and brilliant depiction of one man's descent into madness, and director Todd Phillips brings all of the elements together to create one of the bleakest incarnations of the classic character.One thing that really impressed me was the fact that it managed to take a few steps back from the Batman universe without completely breaking connections to it. I think that's partially where some of the criticisms came from: those connections aren't often strong to completely classify this as an all-out comic book adaptation.The movie's greatest asset, as many have said, is Joaquin Phoenix, who landed his first Academy Award for his stunningly powerful and complex performance as Arthur. He gives the character a genuine soul, and he even allows the audience to like him and sympathize with Arthur. The film becomes more heartbreaking and terrifying as we see Arthur's despair completely take hold of him, and by the film's final scenes, I truly felt I had seen the Joker character make a complete and chilling emergence.This is one of my favorite films of the decade, and a genuinely chilling psychological thriller that balances the comic book elements with a more grounded story.","

"Joker","MadamWarden","3 October 2019","This is a good movie. Dark, tragic and brooding. So many excellent aspects to it. Great acting, sets, costumes. Fantastic score.But...The context is that this is The Joker of Batman Nemeses notoriety. The film just doesn't fit. Arthur is a truly sad and tragic, disturbed and intellectually challenged character. His back story is deeply disturbing and one cannot help but feel sympathy if not empathy. The REAL Joker is not a sad victim. He is a malevolent, intelligent maniac. Not someone you have an ounce of sympathy for.I think this movie fails because of this context. If it was purely a study into the psychological development of a sociopath I think it would be excellent. Sadly it is not. It is the origin story of a comic book baddie. Nothing comic book baddie about this miserable human.There are a few other issues I had with it, there primary one being that he is incapable of coherent speech and social interaction throughout the movie but he suddenly is able to produce a powerful monologue on set in front of a live audience and in front of TV cameras and his former idol. I understand that his confidence grows the less he has to lose but I found this jarring and dissonant.I also found his fantasy relationship silly and then overly ""explained"".That aside, Joachim is phenomenal!! A one man tour de force. Truly believable if not relatable.This is a must see for his performance but I think Batman fans will be disappointed.","

"Joker","wandernn1-81-683274","10 September 2023","Finally got a chance to see this after so long a time, and I was quite impressed. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing as this character. The origin story of the Joker, and of course not every fan is going to like it. I don't really care about the comics or the lore, I'm just judging this story on its own. And I thought it was really good.Just another evidence that Metacritic is a lump, looking at the score it gets there.The performance really reminded me most of Caesar Romero's Joker. The laughing constantly and the sad clown part of it. It was a tribute to that time for sure.What a performance by Joaquin and some good writing here.8/10.","

"Joker","danteshamest","3 October 2019","While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance.","

Everybody is calling this a 'masterpiece', but nobody can tell me why it was such a masterpiece. If it was a movie about how a society creates a killer, then it was done very poorly.

"Joker","LargeTortoise","21 February 2024","I'll be frank, I do not care about Batman at all. My entire friend group is into it so I keep up to date with them. But me not caring about Batman is why this is a good movie to me.It is an entertaining biopic of a legendary villain that presents good storytelling and a killer performance by Joaquin Phoenix. I would rewatch it willingly and will watch them going forward.For me, the only things I disliked about it are the aspects that make it too ""comic booky"" as I've taken to calling it. I enjoy lore. Alot. A bit too much by my own admission. What annoys me about comic based media is the general refusal to establish any lore. This more than most offers a ton of definitive reasons for Arthur's spiral into the Joker then rips it away. I understand why they do this for the sake of the comic heritage but its for that reason I physically cannot like this movie any more than a passing ""that was good"" before I forget about it a week later.I recommend it and I am sure that both comic fans and people like myself will thoroughly enjoy it. I am just in a weird situation where this genre was not meant for me and I have to accept that.","

Joaquin Phoenix's captivating performance, coupled with Todd Phillips' impeccable direction, creates a film that is both disturbing and deeply resonant. It is a chilling exploration of the human psyche, shedding light on the complexities of society and the potential for darkness that resides within us all.It is not a film for the faint of heart, but for those willing to immerse themselves in its darkness, it offers a profound and unforgettable experience.","

"Joker","evanston_dad","11 October 2019","It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by ""Joker."" The last one I can think of that comes close was ""First Reformed"" from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas ""Joker"" is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood"" territory we're talking about here, where the word ""acting"" seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.There's a lot of controversy swirling around ""Joker."" Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy?"" I think people will see what they want to see in ""Joker."" Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily ""said"" anything. ""Joker"" is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?It will be interesting to see how my reactions to ""Joker"" change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.Grade: A","

"Joker","eddie_baggins","27 September 2019","Whether you end up loving or hating Joker, Todd Phillip's gritty and Scorsese like take on the legendary DC comics villain, there's no denying that the cinematic comic book adaptations landscape has been changed forever.Just as Nolan changed our expectations for what a comic book film can be with his Dark Knight trilogy, Joker's examination of the birth of a nefarious villain hellbent on chaos and anarchy is unlike anything we've ever seen before, stripping the well known character back to the bare basics as we're introduced to the sad life of the misunderstood and unloved Arthur Fleck.Sharing more in common with dramas such as Taxi Driver and Serpico, rather than it's other comic book cousins, Phillip's and his mindbogglingly good leading man Joaquin Phoenix take us into the mind of a broken man trying to fit into a world that doesn't want to open its arms to him, in what's an engaging, cant look away character study that slowly but surely descends into a dark and uncomfortable place that befits the name and reputation of its title being.It may seem far to early to call but I for one am confident in saying that Phoenix's full embodiment of Fleck goes down as one of the most singularly impressive acting turns of not only the decade, but all time.Similar to what De Niro did as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, what Daniel Day Lewis did as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood and what Pacino achieved with Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon, Phoenix commands every second of screen time he gets in Phillips dark tale, in what must surely be the biggest sure fire bet for an Oscar you could ever hope to get.From the way in which Fleck appears physically, from a simple walk, through to a slight facial tick, right through to a haunting and hard to forget collection of haunting laughs, Phoenix appears in virtually every scene of Joker and never ones fails to enthrall, and in doing so his managed to do the seemingly impossible of allowing us to understand a deeply flawed and depraved creature but a creature you begin to understand and at times even feel sympathy towards.For all the great incarnations of the character, it's hard to think of a better way in which the Joker could be born into existence and by bringing his own flavour and nuances to Fleck, there's no point in comparing Phoenix to Heath Ledger's iconic take on the face painted mad man, with this take a whole different beast entirely.As good as Phoenix is, it would've only taken the film so far had Phillip's and his team not come to the party but for a relatively small budgeted film, Joker's astounding overall quality ensures it can comfortably sit in the top class of 2019 films.It's amazing to think that this is a film from the same man that gave us Old School and The Hangover but Joker sees Phillip's grow into a whole new level with his on point direction, that fits perfectly with Lawrence Sher's eye-capturing 70's like cinematography and Hildur Guðnadóttir's memorizing score, giving Joker an epic and unforgettable cinematic verve that brings it's A game too match its captivating leading man.While first and foremost a believable tale of a man pushed to the edge of his already teetering limits, Joker also manages to throw in a number of surprising narrative and comic book throwbacks that will be no doubt be discussed ad-nauseam by die-hard fans and naturally tie together Fleck's story to a much broader universe without ever feeling forced or unnatural, all within a tale that is as confronting and even topical as you'd get regardless of genre.Final Say -Bleak, beautiful and boundlessly inventive, led by a Joaquin Phoenix performance for the ages, Joker is an outstanding cinematic achievement that's sure to be talked about for years yet to come.5 French Fries out of 5","

"Joker","fopfopfop","10 February 2020","So in a world full of horrible horrible superhero movies that are in nonstop production, this is refreshing, but this is not a superhero movie. For that matter this is not a super villain movie either. There is no batman, no superhero to be seen. Truthfully the movie feels like king of comedy mashed with a little taxi driver (admitted by phillips), with just a bit of v for vendetta, and seven thrown in. In that sense it is good and worth watching. It is dark, very twisted, and very deserving of its R rating. However, (and lets preface with what's to follow with I am not into superheros or comic books) this is not the origin story of a super genius arch enemy of batman. This guy can't read or write, there is no talent for chemistry to be seen, he seems mediocre in every sense other than he is a true psychopath. If this was about a guy who thought he was the joker from batman I would have probably applauded it, but as a super villain origin story I just don't buy it. Final thoughts on Phoenix's performance very convincing, very well done. So good movie on its own as a movie, but not a good origin story for a super villain (which affects its score).","

"Joker","Maxence_G","8 October 2019","Tonight, I went to see the movie Joker about the origins of Batman nemesis, as you may have noticed by reading my other entries in this diary, I had extremely high expectations for this film. With so many expectations, I thought it would be difficult for this work to touch me or surprise me. Yet coming out of the cinema I was completely dazzled, by what seems to me to be the best film of the decade. This film deals well with the psychology of the character, he approaches the character as never before, the end and the revelations that are made to me took my breath away. Finally, I hope that Joaquin Phoenix, the actor who plays the Joker probably achieved the performance of his life even outperforming his own interpretation of Commodus in the Gladiator film. In Todd Phillips' film Joker, he presented a performance that pays tribute to the great names in film. I am confident that his role will be honored at the Oscars and other major awards ceremonies.","

"Joker","ferguson-6","3 October 2019","Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind.","

"Joker","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5 October 2019","Arthur(Phoenix, Oscar-worthy yet again) is a clown for hire. He wants to cheer up the world. And to experience human connection. For someone to notice him without becoming verbally, frequently even physically, abusive. To be treated like a person. He struggles with mental illness. Both finding successful treatment, and for others to stop responding so negatively to his diagnosis. And while he feels perpetually lonely, he's not the only one to realize how bad things are getting, and how little those with money and influence do to help anyone but themselves.This is deeply messed up. It makes your mind go places you never thought it would. Including, maybe especially, when funny. In other words, it nails the core, managing to also put a fresh coat of paint on an icon with nearly 80 years of history. This explores how little sympathy and empathy(the lead only loses the audience's once he becomes a monster) is shown towards the least powerful people in society. However, it's not exclusively(albeit chiefly) about those with psychological issues. It also goes into poverty. How little those that could easily address these things even try to properly comprehend the problems. I'm not saying there's a solution that would not require time, political will and accountability for those who use their clout to try to fight these efforts. What I am saying is that we need those I'm talking about to join in the process.Taxi Driver very clearly shaped a lot of this, to incredible effect, and this film is as amazing as that one. This is the first live-action version(at least in the last 30+ years, I will grant that I am not very familiar with the takes that go back further than that) where you can understand how the Joker ends up with his signature look in a realistic world. A vigilante using martial arts and gadgets would have felt hugely out of place in this, so I'm thrilled nothing like that appears(Bruce is a child here), and I hope that this remains standalone, rather than Joaquin facing off against Batman. Keeping in mind that I love The Dark Knight trilogy.I rarely give anything the highest possible score. To me, it means that while the movie isn't perfect(that is a status that should be strived for: it can never truly be reached), there is no weakness within it that is not greatly outweighed by its positives. That's not even a contest when it comes to this. I can't put into words how grateful I am to everyone who worked on this for being able to say that about it.There is some bloody violence in this, a little of it immensely brutal. I recommend this to everyone who is passionate about the titular character. 10/10","

"Joker","gatozangado","26 September 2019","It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.","

"Joker","argimlumani","29 November 2019","You get Arthur flick played brilliantly by Phoenix his performance in this film is outstanding much better than any interpretation of this character I honestly cant go back and read any comics or watch any movies because this character is better written than all of them combined this movie doesn't have a supervillian who's going to destroy the city with a bomb none of that crap here we get to see joker the human being a man who has clearly been suffering all his life in the comic they would say it would take one bad day to drive a man insane that's not the case here this man had been suffering for years and finally he cracked one of the best scenes is him watching the tv and he imagines himself at the Murray franklin show he gets single out for his laugh and is accepted and hugged by his idol Murray that was brillant because i don't care who you are we as human beings want to be accepted for who we are and loved unconditionally but that's the problem Arthur never got any of that love he gets treated like sh! by nearly every one in this film the only person who treated him like a human being was the dwarf and Arthur let him live which I thougt was brilliant it added layers of depth to this character the joker in the comics would of killed the dwarf this one didn't which is fascinating to me he only kills people who have directly wronged him like his mother who is a horrible person we find out why Arthur is the way he is because she allowed him to abused and he smother her and says I always thought my life was a tragedy but its a comedy because nothing he does matters his life is a joke by this point in the film hes got nothing to lose when he kills Randall another awful human being who most likely had a hand in getting him fired from his job he embraces his madness and dances down the steps hes liberated finally free to do as he pleases no medication nothing than he goes on the Murray show and I never noticed this detail the 1st time watching it the original joke was knock knock than he proceeded to kill himself live in front of the world to show society this is what you have made me but Murray didnt stfu he kept pushing him the brilliant dialogue and acting in this scene is off the charts quotes like ""if it was me dying on the sidewalk youd walk right by me I pass you every day and you dont notice me"" which is true go in any major city see people walk right by homeless on the streets dying nobody cares people are apathetic but then he proceeds to tell Murray youre awful playing my video you just wanted to make fun of me if you look at Arthur in the hospital scene with his mother when Murray played his tape you can see the pain in his face Murray was his idol and he threw him under the bus so he decides to give Murray one last joke what do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash I'll tell you what you get you get what you deserve and he blows Murray brains out on live tv and sits there for a moment and laughs because his life is a joke the way the scene played out with the brilliant score you knew it was coming the tension was boiling over and Arthur allows the police to capture him Gotham is full of riots rightfully so the waynes get gunned down as a result of his actions and honestly I don't feel any empathy for the waynes theyre awful people Thomas in particular calling every poor person who has suffered clowns and he says he wants to run for mayor to improve peoples lives yet Arthurs medicial programs are all cut he loses his medicine is forced to go cold turkey if Thomas Wayne actually cared he could of funded a new program but he didnt becuase he didnt care this performance of the Wayne's is the most realistic portrayal of these characters and thr film ends with a what if scenario what really happend was he in the Aslyum all this time it doesn't matter ultimately because the point of the film is society has a role to play in creating these monsters as does the media for publishing their photos and making them stars I hope at least Phoenix gets nominated because if front the Oscars are bs his performance as Arthur fleck had me thinking about this movie for a week it truly is thought provoking and better than any comic book film to come out in 20 years","

"Joker","trolliyama","31 January 2020","In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and in an endless sea of mediocre cape flicks released every year, the Joker obviously looks like a masterpiece by comparison.The movie itself is not as memorable or clever as the fanboys claim it is, but it still mesmerizes me the passionate reactions everyone seems to have about the Joker, with some acting as if this was some sort of cinematic Antichrist (Similar to the way in which a lot of people reacted to the mere existence of movies like the Da Vinci Code or the Last Temptation of the Christ back then) claiming it would definitely inspire acts of violence.I can't help but find ironic how a movie that demonizes the rich (To be fair, they totally deserve to be demonized) still manages to get lot of love from the same kind of reactionaries that would be against billionaires paying higher taxes, and also a lot of love from people who worship Trump as a god (Despite the fact that Trump and his cronies are very close in personality to the trio of rich jerks that harass Arthur in the subway than Thomas Wayne-Who, by the way, isn't exactly portrayed very sympathetically either)Must be a consequence of these clueless reviews and hot takes made by equally clueless reviewers that only focus in the fact that the main character is Caucasian and male, and not in the fact that he is poor and suffering from bad (physical and mental) health, despite the fact the movie clearly shows he is anything but privileged. And also, despite the fact the events from this movie are told from the perspective of Arthur Fleck, that doesn't mean the movie ""glorifies"" his behavior, nor is he portrayed as a hero (Also remember that plenty of scenes made very clear he is pretty delusional, so his perspective of the events is ambiguous at best, but it seems that modern audiences have become allergic to any form of ambiguity for some reason)Sometimes I wonder why the Batman-related media seems to have such bizarre effect on people. It's the Dark Knight all over again, a decent movie treated as the best thing since sliced bread. And while I admit that while this is better than anything from the MCU, I also think that kind of soulless corporate garbage shouldn't be the measure of quality for anything.","

"Joker","Lewis_Heather787","5 October 2019","An awful lot has been talked about this film even before it hit cinemas. From the triumphs at the film festivals to the backlash surrounding the subject matter of the film. There hasn't been a film in quiet like it in some time that has brought up such emotion/controversy in the public eye. Not gonna lie I was anticipating this film as soon as it was announced...........it was really fascinating to me as to why on earth Warner Bros. thought that audiences needed/wanted a Joker ""solo/origin"" film. There had to be something special about it........................my god is there something special about this film. It is truly unique not just as a comic book film but just as a film. Its more a psychological thriller than a comic book film.Joaquin Phoenix is a fantastic actor no-one can take that away from him, even before witnessing his performance in this film, the man is a truly great actor anyway. Wow just wow............I didn't think it was humanly possible that anyone could embody the character of the ""Joker"" quiet like Heath Ledger did over a decade ago....but wow does Phoenix come very very close. (I know you shouldn't compare......because its not fair on either performance...........there both fantastic in there own right). Phoenix's character Arthur Fleck is pretty much your every day person at the start, however its witnessing the terrible decline in one mans journey that is truly horrifying. I'm gonna say it he deserves at least an Oscar nomination...if not more. Takes your breath away.There are so many story elements to this film that just hit the nail right on the head, firstly the misdirection of Thomas Wayne being Arthur Flecks father is fantastic.....a really interesting angle however it is quickly super-seeded by the fact that Flecks mother was mentally unwell and made the whole thing up.....also whilst in the process uncovering that Fleck was adopted. His complete hallucination of Zazie Beetz character being involved with him, is done so so well, it only dawns on you at the final moment that it was a figment of his imagination........the figment being a really normal life. Mind blown!!!!!!!!!! All of which has such emotion and punch especially on Arthur........who is unwell, but that is slightly put upon him by the society that he inhabits. The culture of isolationism within Gotham City only fuels the fire raging inside Fleck waiting for the right moment to appear.......and boy it does.On to the controversy surrounding the film. My own personally opinion, anyone reading this is perfectly entitled to disagree, there is no controversy with this film at all. I believe the reason for people feeling uncomfortable with this film is because it shows a true representation of what would happen to a man like this.......and more importantly that it could happen in real life today. With the society we live in today in 2019, it is plausible what happens on screen could become reality to a certain degree. Thats the part, I think, that horrifies people. Its definitely not glorifying violence, this is not a tremendously violent film...it has its moments here and there. There are plenty more violent films that have been made and are going to be made. What this film does glorify is the stigma attached to class status and mental health illnesses, however its trying to open your eyes. The film is trying to make you look in the mirror and show you that this is our society really, that Gotham City and Arthur Fleck could be replaced by anyone and anywhere if we don't look at these societal problems. Thats what I think anyway.Final positive the score is out of this world. I know this sounds very snobby thing to say but the score really does inhabit an added character to the film........it is truly horrifying. Oscar nod 100%.Overall this film is great....I definitely need to see it again, it needs a deserves a second viewing to really understand and appreciate everything. 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10. Fantastic, real eye opening story, mind blowing performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Must also mention great directing from Todd Phillips.......the guy that did ""The Hangover"" did this.........wow. Even if your not a comic book film fan you must see this because this is least comic-booky film your ever going to see, ""King of Comedy"" meets ""Taxi Driver"".","

"Joker","cmills-98693","7 October 2019","Without a doubt, Joker is in contention for the film of the year.With Joachin Phoenix garnering praise left and right for Joker it's easy to dismiss the multiple other elements of direction, sound mixing, editing, cinematography, set and costume design and casting that make this a truly astounding piece of artistic cinema.
Joker is a film that without any one of these elements, it would fail. It would slip into the same bracket as Suicide Squad and be forgotten, but, fail it certainly does not.Joachin Phoenix is phenomenal. We know this already from pictures like Her and The Master, what we didn't know was how utterly deep and broad his range was. At points, I was totally absorbed by Joker. For the first time in possibly 10 years the movie theatre melted away, along with other viewers and noises and I was a part of that film. It was as if I was watching a documentary, rather than a fictional work. His commitment to the role, his weight loss and mental strain are dangerous but it produces something that no one ever thought would happen. It produces a performance that could genuinely rival Heath Ledgers.Todd Phillips direction and script are masterstrokes. If it were a painting it would be a Turner, with bright violent skies, and dark sad landscapes. His beautiful melting pot of inspiration features large doses of Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver', alongside the physiological battery acid from more recent pictures such as Fight Club and Black Swan.
It swirls together to birth this bitter, gritty, dark, mesmerising masterpiece, that both requires and demands, multiple, in-depth viewings.For me, what makes this film is the costume design and the cinematography. The design of every minute detail on each character to make Gotham look even more drab and dull, even more grimy and beaten down is exceptional. Similar to how Scorsese made Harlem and The Bronx look broken and corrupted in Taxi Driver, you feel physically dirty after watching numerous sequences and you feel pangs of genuine social guilt stemming from your own moments of awful selfishness.
The cinematography is astounding, and MUST be in contention for an Academy Award, alongside Best Lead, Best Direction and best Sound Mixing. Some of the shots could have been lifted from a Time Magazine piece on 'City Life' they're that artistically powerful. Whole, dialogue-free sequences that say far more with silence and sounds of a city teetering on the brink of oblivion in the background than anyone could ever say. The sound mixing to have conversations, telephones, car horns, shouting, trains prevalent in the background audio leaking into the foreground does what Nolan did in 'Dunkirk' and pushes further the feeling of strain. The idea that even noise is seeping in from the city and soon the barricade will break and it'll drown us all in it's filth, corruption and decadence.Joker is a true masterpiece. So dark, so dirty, so vindictive of a modern flawed and broken societal system, but it always reminds you:
Put on a happy face.","

"Joker","Ruskington","25 October 2019","There isn't much else to say; Joker is one of the most absorbing, powerful films ever made. The cinematography is remarkable and the score is just perfectly potent and understated. This is not a thrill-a-minute movie designed to keep you entertained throughout. It is a heavy, all-consuming character study that invites you, with reluctance and fascination, into the mind of a severely disturbed outcast. I don't remember any movie leaving me feeling so emotionally disoriented as I left the cinema.The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something very special indeed. We spend nearly the full two hours just watching him close up and every second is exhilarating. Rarely, if ever, has a character been so utterly captivating, so desperate and so tragic. His physical acting, from writhing in anguish to dancing with warped delight, is utterly mesmerising. And not once did he ever lay it on too thick. To portray that level of pain and fury without indulging in excess morbidity or melodrama is quite an achievement.Forget where this masterpiece fits into the world of DC comics and Batman movies; Joker is a stand-alone film that deservedly takes its place amongst the greats.","

"Joker","Vic_max","7 October 2019","This is not your typical comic book movie. No superpowers, superheroes or end-of-the world scenarios. In fact, there's not really any modern special effects. If the ""Joker"" wasn't one of a most culturally recognizable villains, this movie may not have the wide impact it's having.However - he is a central character in the DC comic universe. This movie gives him a plausible, wildly dark and often sad origin story. This would not be the same movie without Phoenix's eccentric performance. He made it disturbing and believable. If he wins the Oscar for lead actor, it will be the second time someone won an Oscar for being the Joker (the other being Heath Ledger in 2009).The story may hit a deep note with many people who've felt disenfranchised, alienated or ignored by society or their families. For 2 hours, I felt drawn into the world and crazed reality of the main character, Arthur Fleck (aka Joker). For that - I have to say it was a compelling watch.","

"Joker","naj-80897","12 October 2019","Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.","

"Joker","warthogjump","9 October 2019","The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other!","

"Joker","CatDayAfternoon","15 October 2019","I haven't been this obsessed with a movie since I saw Taxi Driver 30 years ago...and my obsession for Joker surpasses it in spades. Everyone else has said all there is to say, I can't really add to it other than to say it almost feels pointless to go to the movies after seeing this because it's impossible for anything to compare. I can't explain why it's so good, you just have to see it. The directing, cinematography, music, screenplay, and of course the jaw dropping acting....everything about it is flawless. The timing of the film is uncomfortable, yes, but I think it's needed. Joker doesn't teach us to be violent. It teaches us to STOP BEING SUCH ***HOLES TO EACH OTHER.I understand that not everyone will connect with this film or ""get it"". And you're not supposed to. This is a film for those who relate to it in some way and not everyone will. But if you do, if you get it, you won't ever see a more remarkable and all consuming film. It's truly astonishing filmmaking.And if it doesn't sweep every category at the Oscars because of controversy then shame on the Academy and shame on everyone voting.","

"Joker","botrytis","6 October 2019","This movie will show you how serious and uncomprehensible a mental state like this is.Joker didn't become like this just for no reason, the oppression, pressure, the environment that shaped him into this is all there. Making him not the only one to blame, or to call EVIL, the movie shows you perfectly how society can be dirty, unjust, inhuman, evil in the same way.You will feel for Joker, you will pity him, you will despise him, you will like him, you will fear him, these all feeligns will be there in you, the only thing that will be questionable is your judgement... you won't be able to judge him, only yourself and the system you live in.There is no hero here, it's a trip of torment where the pleasure comes in the form of understanding all the mess behind a twisted, deformed mind, a mind that by becoming a villain finally finds its peace, by becoming complete. There won't be a hero and a villain in the end, it will be a villain against other villain(s).There are already countless interpretations of all the plot this movie tells for 2 hours. But what's important here is the feeling you will have before-during-after the movie. Whichever conclusion you will get from this story it won't be happy.The storytelling is amazing, almost masterful, with only a few things that would needed more elaborativeness, details, and even those lacky parts only take place in the first half. So overall a close perfect story.The music is haunting, understandably conceptual, fitting organicaly to all this narrative.The acting is TOP-NOTCH! Just for that is important to see this movie, you won't see dedication like this anywhere that frequently.Cinematography is also hauntingly amazing, the colors, powerful, intimate scenes, you will see this world through the eyes of Joker himself, and the picture of this movie will represent that really powerfully.This is an important and a must-see motion picture. This will be the best movie you will see today amongst all that BS Hollywood/America selfglorifying mess! We live in a messy, imperfect, arrogant system and you better face it. This production will make anyone, even those who point their fingers on others to look in themselves and get some perspective of their own reality.","

A man's mental stability and health spiralling uncontrollably without filter. The cinematography is also spectacular, influenced largely on Scorsese's Taxi Driver as are other elements of this movie.There are also glaring similarities between this Joker and Rupert Pupkin from The King of Comedy, however De Niro's character study, in my opinion, is better, but only just.Todd Philips' direction is well balanced and he guides us between tension and climax just right.Overall, Joker is dark and not like any other comic book movie, which is truly a good thing.","

Interesting but slightly bloated origin story of the arch criminal villain of The DC universe with Phoenix at the top of his game as the much-put-upon Arthur Fleck in Gotham City circa 1981 who reaches his breaking point and a moment of clarity of what his true significant purpose is in life with deadly consequences ensuing. While director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver) attempts to get in touch with his inner Scorsese by paralleling his worldview ala Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin (going full meta in even employing De Niro as talk-show host Murray Franklin) with far too many touchstones to count. Phoenix's chameleon-like physicality (shedding over 50 pounds) to give the slightly anemic/skeletal protagonist its spine by tapping into his own Christian Bale ala THE MECHANIC and his eerie, off-settling helpless cackle becomes instantly iconic in the canon of actors who've portrayed this homicidal harlequin.","

"Joker","TheUserIDYouEnteredHasAlready","4 October 2019","But the 10 star reviews that came flooding in were too much for me to take seriously, and I was right.By all means, go see Joker - it's a standalone origin story that needs no knowledge of the Batman series, but it also rewards fans of that series with some very convincing details and very believable storytelling.I won't get into the plot, but there are some twists. Very well done, in fact, even though they are both reminiscent of certain M. Knight Shymalan films. Very tastefully done and expertly integrated into the storyline without overindulgence and quite important for the story and character arcs at play. Bravo in that respect.Also, applause for the cinematography, the style, the homages to previous classics and just the wonderfully realistic atmosphere that the director and his crew were able to bring to life here. Positively the most believable and realistic Gotham ever. Some might find that to be a veiled critique, but it makes this film watchable and enjoyable by those who have no knowledge of the Batman franchise(s).Just altogether airtight production and direction. Hands down.The only gripe I have is with the score - not the songs, necessarily, but the use of over-dramatic violin/cello passages and too-loud unnecessary (and very dark) orchestral pieces that almost take the audience out of the experience. Those who have seen it may know what I am talking about, but no spoilers.All in all, this is very much worth watching even if I feel as though it may spawn some copycats in real life - sure to have a long ""cult film"" life after it fades from the cinemas.7.5/10 with no caveats.","

"Joker","dmehic","4 September 2019","Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.
The film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from ""Taxi Driver"" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from ""The King of Comedy"".
The film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name ""Joker"" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.
Although I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.
But still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to ""The Killing Joke"" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!
I'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76","

"Joker","Prismark10","10 October 2019","What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot. It is a tribute act because of the Scorsese movies that inspired it.","

I admire her talent, DeNiro doesnt move me much the past few years (decades?) and his teeth look like Martin Scorsese used some CGI magic left over from the Irishman to whiten them. I think the high rating for the film here are based on Phoenix's performance and not the film. A performance which I fear we will one day view as overrated.","

"Joker","abhinav-prkash","18 November 2019","Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.","

"Joker","MogwaiMovieReviews","9 October 2019","It's somewhat fortuitous that I saw the pilot episode of that dreadful Batwoman TV show on the same day I saw Joker. The two seem such polar opposites - one is rabid intersectionalist propaganda clumsily shaped by a newly-menstruating 13-year old into something that is almost *entirely* unlike anything recognizable as an actual story, with actual characters and believable situations, dialogue and acting.The other is... well, something other than that - I'm not entirely sure what, but whatever that something is, it can't help but come as something of a relief.The trailers at the cinema were for Feminist Terminator, Feminist Star Wars and 'The Emancipation of Harley Quinn': all explicitly anti-male, openly and unapologetically attacking and tearing down men and masculinity - and at the same time still fully expecting to appeal to the great majority of action, sci-fi and superhero fans, who have always been male.In 2019 it's hard to be a man and go to the cinema or turn on the TV without being told you're obsolete, or 'toxic', or just the biggest problem facing the world today since cancer. In 2019, Joker is the only big film which doesn't do that, the only film which looks at a straight white man as first and foremost a fragile human being in need of love, care, protection and help. In 2019, this, apparently, is a terrible, dangerous, unforgiveable and revolutionary act.Ho hum.* * *So look, the film has its strengths and weaknesses:On the plus side there is, as everyone knows, Joaquin Phoenix's astonishing performance - one of the most gripping pieces of screen acting ever. His Joker is just every tortured, beaten, defeated soul wrapped up in a weak, paper-thin shell that is slowly tearing apart and open before our eyes. He does a great job of showing the effects of the 'double bind' - the strain of being constantly instructed to do (or not do) opposing, contradictory or sometimes impossible things, which can snap an overburdened mind and at least potentially play a role in bringing on schizophrenia. I noticed several deliberately placed moments illustrating this early on in the movie.Secondly, the gorgeous cinematography, on grainy celluloid immediately makes one feel one is watching a stone-cold classic movie from the very start. It feels very much like it could have been shot in 1982 by Martin Scorcese, and there are vigorous nods to both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, as well as a bunch of other 70s crime films. I enjoyed that paying homage aspect of it very much.Thirdly, it is a gritty, realistic, serious and seriously made film - the like of which is rarely attempted today, and of course never as a superhero movie. This, though, is not entirely good news, which brings us to the minuses:The minuses are it's not a superhero movie of any kind. Grey-haired Joaquin seems a little too old for an origin story, and tone-wise, the only film that this could conceivably be a prequel to is The Dark Knight, and even that at a considerable stretch. I repeat for emphasis: Joker is not a superhero movie. Nothing extraordinary or fantastical happens that diverges from the ordinary wretched reality you can read about each day in the newspaper headlines. Because of that, it is quite a considerable downer, never really feels as though it leaves the ground, and eventually one does long for the days of Cesar Romero trapping Adam West in a huge yellow shoe or something.The more realistic you try to make a superhero comic book story, the less fantastical, and thereby enjoyable and entertaining the story will be. The single, solitary exception to this, the one film that captured lightning in a bottle, which DC have been catastrophically failing to repeat ever since, is The Dark Knight, and perhaps the greatest weakness of this present film is that it tries to take that realism even further, to a point where even the memory of the character the film is being based on in the first place is lost.In the final analysis, the whole thing just doesn't up to an awful lot, and without the fantastical superhero element the premise in retrospect seems a small and silly thing to base a film on. It feels much more like a biopic of an overly-bullied high school shooter in a clown mask, not a supervillain able to take on little Bruce Wayne all grown up in a batcopter. Phoenix's Joker is so debilitated and weak, with not one single strength or talent on display, it's impossible to imagine him surrounded by henchmen and weilding joke-shop weapons of mass destruction while strapping on a hi-tech utility belt.None of the other characters are fleshed out even a little, and no-one else's acting is in anything like the same league as the lead. Even though his King Of Comedy is an enormous influence on this film, every time Robert de Niro appears on the screen it just reminds us how he can't be bothered to act anymore, hasn't acted in decades, and now just turns up to collect the money. I have no real complaints about anyone else in the movie, but this is a one man show, and Joaquin Phoenix is the man.Politically, the film seems to have nothing to say and the constant nods in that direction are muddled and confused and seemingly just there for show. No ideas introduced are dealt with or resolved. It's a film of surfaces.For all this complaining, though, it's a shallow film that's still something of a must-see, for the mood, the look, the intensity, and Joaquin Phoenix's creepy ol' laugh.","

"Joker","martinrey-15593","1 June 2020","This is not an easy watch. It's dark and disturbing to witness the Jokers life just prior to turning into the criminal mastermind he becomes.
Joaquin Phoenix is very good as the Joker, his mannerisms and persona are consistent, meticulous and he carries the movie well. That leaves little else though for the cast around him. He's in pretty much every scene which makes the film intense and quite uneasy to watch as you see a man on severe medication get angrier and angrier.
It's a good film but it wont leave you in a happy or rewarding mood after.
There is a bit of Bruce Wayne in there which will leave you asking was there a 30+ year age gap between them?....

"Joker","SweetWilliam63","23 October 2019","Most movies that generate controversy come and go with little fanfare. Usually because they are not particularly good and therefore are tossed into the news cycle and disappeared abruptly and usually deservedly. There was that Seth Rogen movie about assassinating the Chinese dictator (never saw it), the 'Human Centipede' franchise that attempts to offend everybody (never will see it), and who can forget the conservative gasp over the American flag raising being left out of 'First Man' (saw it..meh). The problem with 'Joker' is it is good.
No, it's great. And unless you are prepared to deal with the guilt, misplaced or otherwise, over your enjoyment of it, then you should skip it because Phoenix will seduced you with his performance. Is it wrong given the times we live in? Oh, yes. That's what makes it so amazing. It is impossible to dismiss the fact that this is simply a shockingly brilliant performance. And director Todd Philips offers up nothing to reassure the audience that this is ""just a movie"". There is no gimmick or troupe, ""super"" or otherwise, to remind us that this is a comic book universe. There is no room for Affleck's 'Batman' in this Gotham. It is deliberately as unpreposterous a world that appears to be, tragically, not much removed from our own. There are flaws to the film to be sure (DeNiro is distractingly miscast, and 'Thomas Wayne' is unsympathetically Trumpesque) and there is an argument to be made that we have seen this indepth character study in madness done before (check out Harry Treadaway in 'Mr. Mercedes'). None of that matters. Rest assured 'Joker' won't take home any Oscars. It's too sinister for the times we find ourselves in. As for Phoenix, his performance demands a whole new category that surpasses ""best actor"". But it will have to do.","

"Joker","staticstation1","3 October 2019","Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors.","

"Joker","perica-43151","4 October 2019","There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a dishonest, knee-jerk defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their gaslighting charade might get uncovered. It is not Joker that is delusional, it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypo crites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is.","

This movie makes no attempt (as so many other movies do these days) to put a positive spin on a villain or invert morality to make its protagonist secretly good or make the audience root for him. Despite this, the film elicits empathy for the broken man it holds in its spotlight in the same way one might feel empathy for a diseased, mistreated, but ultimately unsalvageable dog. In the end, your heart goes out to him, but you still feel like someone should put him down, and that's exactly how one ought to feel for one of Gotham's most well known psychopaths.","

He has problems with his mother, his boss, his coworkers, etc. His idol, a famous comedian and late show host, humiliates him on national television. And so on, and so on.Maybe that's the point--or the joke--but it's still formulaic.Joaquin Phoenix's acting was a bit awkward at times but still good.

It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world. The reason why people liked it so much is because the sad corporate slaves (especially the youth currently being indoctrinated) were subconsciously tricked into believing they were part of some bigger cause when they were really just sitting in their comfy chairs.","

"Joker","barevfilm","24 September 2019","The movie JOKER, which had its world premiere at Venice 2019 and won the Golden Lion best film award on the Lido, has been mistakenly termed a ""comic book film"". True it is in a sense spinoff from the comic book based Batman film series, however, this is a serious non-comic book psychological study of how a would be stand-up comedian with a pathetic laughing syndrome goes wrong and becomes a psychotic killer. Joaquin Phoenix, 44, with his astounding interpretations of this peculiar character has now clearly established himself as the new king of Hollywood and even knocks off one of the old kings, Robert De Niro, in a short but telling sequence.
Basically this is a speculative account of how a notoriously evil public enemy, later to be known as ""The Joker"", started out as an innocent clown who loved his mother but was the victim of a ""condition"" (uncontrollable laughter) which made him a societal outcast and eventually warped his mind. His first killing which was basically in self defense when brutally attacked by three ""respectable"" men in a metro car is interpreted by the media as unmotivated murder because only we in the audience saw the brutal kicking attack. The irony is that the gun he pulled on them was given him by a fellow clown to use only in self defense. It turns out that his widowed mother has dark secrets of her own (which will peripherally connect us with the future Batman) but Phoenix as wannabe comedian ""Arthur Fleck "" (what a spotty name!) takes this role to the outer limits of the twilight zone as his frenzied laughter becomes more and more menacing. His constant disclaimer is ""I have a condition"" -- and what a condition it will turn out to be! -- culminating in his live on TV shooting of a Jay Leno type talk show host (De Niro) who, fascinated by his personality has invited Fleck to appear as a special guest. Not enough can be said of Joaquin Phoenix's bravura performance and the end result of this masterful film (Kudos to director Todd Phillips as well) is to shock you out of your pants. But a kind of shock that is exhilarating in the cinematic artistic and social sense.","

"Joker","littleging12","11 January 2020","Joker is the latest iteration of the Clown Prince of Crime. After many different versions of the character, director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix give their film a sense of identity by taking after Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. They do this by making this version darker, and more realistic to even greater extremes. Joaquin Phoenix gives such a stellar performance, he'd make Heath Ledger proud. Joker hits, and hits hard. It works as a riveting character study, as well as an unnervingly realistic depiction of mental illness.To say Joker is controversial is an understatement. The film deals with real world issues like mental illness, poverty, class wars, child abuse, antisocial behaviors, and anarchy. Many people will probably be put off with how disturbing the subject matter is. Others will see the film as glorifying antisocial behavior. Some will see it as mere entertainment. One thing that almost everyone can agree upon is this: this is one dark movie. Some people are afraid this film might incite real life violence. This film is similar to Fight Club, in regard that it comprises of crazy people doing anarchist things for the audience's amusement. Some people have valid concerns, however, Joker, although fictional, is a film that represents reality. There have been rebellions, and riots before, as well as class wars, and incidents incited by mentally disturbed individuals. Though the exact events of Joker have never happened in real life, they easily could. This film like most films should be left to viewers discretion. Art represents reality, and reality isn't always pretty.Some people may also be turned off by Joker's realism. The main character Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose alter ego is the Joker, is a man down on his luck suffering from a mental illness. This movie doesn't hold back by showing mental illness in all its ugliness. Crazy people have graced the screen before, but real life crazy is not glamorous in the slightest sense. You couldn't help but feel unnerved and disturbed by the sheer ugliness of this crazy crime-ridden, messed-up take on Gotham city. The world is so dark, apathetic, and brutal. The streets are littered with rats and other filth, government programs get shut down do to a lack of funding, and depressing scenery of busy toxic city life cram the screen. One can't blame Arthur for losing his mind.Something the film excelled at was getting the audience to empathize or feel bad for Arthur, aka The Joker. His life and the world around him is so soul-crushingly harsh. When the film starts out, he is not that bad of a guy. He cares for his ailing mother, works unfulfilling jobs, and fights his mental illness. The society crumbling around him creates the Joker. It's very realistic to see Joker unintentionally and indirectly starting all this mayhem and anarchy. He is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker extremely well. He is more of a mentally ill man wearing clown makeup than a larger-than-life supervillain. Joaquin plays the character in the shadow of Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, except Joaquin's character is even more socially isolated and disturbed.Joker is heavily influenced by Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy - two films that star Robert De Niro. Both of Scorsese's films deal with a mentally unhinged loner acting out against society in violent or antisocial ways. Joker tries to be a combination of the two films while molding itself into Batman lore. Joker successfully weaves its influences together without being derivative. If there are any criticisms, they are all minor - typical movie sins you find in most movies. To name a few, how does Arthur sneak a gun onto a Talk Show and how does he sneak into the Wayne theater so easily. Criticisms apart, along with two great Scorsese films, Joker stays with you with its compelling performances, disturbing subject matter, and shocking moments. Joker gets under your skin and lingers there.","

"Joker","reagansteyn","8 October 2019","This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after.","

"Joker","josephrygaard","17 October 2019","""Joker"" (2019) is a story about a man pushed to his limits from the society around him. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Before the review of Joker's contents, a few words need to be said about the controversy and debate Joker stirred prior to its release (and which still persists). Amongst other things, one caution has been that Joker tries to have the audience sympathize with a psychopath who commits violent crimes. The answers to presumptions in that category are very complex. Joker deals with tough topics such as mental illness, poverty, bullying and social class division to an extent where you are likely to feel impacted in some way. However, that doesn't mean that you justify the actions the main character, Arthur - and that is the point a lot of people fails to see. Sympathizing does not equal justifying, and while you can feel pity for the troubles Arthur goes through, you never condone the actions that he takes. Joker is not about that. Joker is about witnessing a man getting crushed under the vices of the people and system around him, and about understanding the role we as citizens and bystanders have in creating Jokers like him.That being said, this movie is psychologically dark and disturbing. Not purely from the grim and the Kafkaesque tone, but mainly from how real this movie is. Joker sucks you in to a sequence of events that could already be going on in some part of the world - and quite likely is. Nothing feels over-the-top or pushed, whether it be the characters, sexual elements, or even the violence. It all blends together perfectly together with the constantly menacing atmosphere. That is not to say that these elements don't exist or gets noticed - there are for example a few extremely graphic and violent scenes that are very impactful and piercing, but mainly because of their rarity and the underlying pressure behind them.Technically, this movie is a masterpiece. The cinematography is consistently gorgeous with amazing colors and just the right lighting, and the score is simplistic, hypnotizing and shockingly brutal. The pacing is perfection defined, and the dialogue will be quoted for years to come. Last but not least, Joaquin Phoenix delivers a feat which evolves Arthur into something more than an actor's performance.That leads us to the final question - does Phoenix's performance live up to that of Ledger's? While the different Jokers explores different sides of the Joker persona, there is little to no doubt that Phoenix has lived up to the sky-high level Ledger set. On a personal note: while I still revel in the chaotic dynamics of the Dark Knight, I ultimately find myself more intrigued and horrified with Arthur Fleck, and his gradual descent into madness, step by step.My personal grade: a haunting 9/10.

"Joker","Instant_Palmer","18 June 2020","Joaquin Phoenix produces one of the most memorable performances ever captured in a feature film, earning the hardware and accolades he received for his stunning and disturbing portayal of Joker.Joaquin puts on a virtuoso spotlight performance, and elevates the movie to legendary status. Credit director Todd Philips for building tension throughout the film, capturing the nuances of Joker's tortured dark-side slide into deranged, violent insanity, keeping the film's pace and flow on-track without unnecessary fill, utilizing and applying various camera lenses, shot angles, lighting, colors/hues, aperture settings (e.g. bokeh), and scene framing, and allowing Joaquin to tap into his own dark corners and utilize his unique acting instincts in developing his character.Phoenix's acting performance leaves nothing on the table - if keeping score, Phoenix tallies a perfect 10 producing a truly legendary performance, transforming the film from God knows what it would have been with another actor to a 9/10.A performance and film that one will not easily forget.","

"Joker","thomas-leitha","20 October 2019","Well played, well shot but one wonders why the movie theater is packed with Teens and Twens obviously enjoying the film.
The plot stays within the usual boundaries: Villains have to have a condition to avoid that society (even the rich) is left with all the blame. I have seen worse films but I apart from some very intense camera work and acting, I left the movie with mixed feelings, mostly because I wonder what makes others rave about this story. With all the current anger and protests around the world, from the yellow jackets in France to the protesters in Hong Kong, Quito, Barcelona and Santiago de Chile one explanation might be that this plot about the origin of anger and aggression in a troubled looser who blames individuals, not the system, to be ignorant and deaf to his needs, apparently seems logical to a generation without other means to explain their personal anger.","

"Joker","LeonardKniffel","23 May 2020","Reviewing ""Joker"" in ""The New Yorker,"" the great film critic Anthony Lane called it a ""lurid spectacle"" and a ""miserablist manifesto."" Other IMDB user reviews give away the plot, so I won't recap it, and the film FAQ in this database provides an exceptionally lengthy explanation for all the bewildering plot twists and possible motivations for Joaquin Phoenix's disturbing portrayal of a psychopathic killer with so many mental disorders it is impossible to name them all. Watching this film is like being subjected to a two-hour nightmare--not of anything in the viewer's brain or for that matter in the mind of the main character--unless it's a reminder to take your meds. No, it's all about the writer/director's attempt to cash in on our national cynicism. Although the movie pretends to be on the side of the poor, the abused, and the downtrodden, it also suggests that the evil media, the complacent rich, law enforcement, social workers, and just about every sane person in ""Gotham"" (read New York City) is part of an evil cabal that has taken control of the world. Just in case serial killer John Wayne Gacy didn't sound the death knell for professional clowns, this movie tries its best to do so. Other good films have been made about the insane taking over the asylum but never with this much cold calculated cash in mind and so little insight into insanity itself.""I happen to dislike the film as heartily as anything I've seen in the past decade,"" Anthony Lane said in his September 2019""New Yorker"" review, ""but I realize, equally, that to vent any inordinate wrath toward it is to fall straight into its trap, for outrage merely proves that our attention has been snagged. Just ask the President of the United States.""","

"Joker","YouTubeblack","10 October 2019","I went in the movie expecting a basic/ straight forward origin story of the joker and how he would fit in the Gotham of this Universe. But I got something else, an experience like never before from a comic book film. After the first watch I couldn't grasp everything, but after watching it for the third time, there are so many things happening that you would not even think of are happening, or ask yourself are they even real? The more you watch this film the more it grows on you, makes you think about the reality. The movie doesn't end on a straight forward conclusion, but keeps the mystery intact, and is open to interpretation. My take on this one is that, this movie is not about the joker which we know from the comics and live action movies, but it's about a man who impregnated this chaos in Gotham which led to hundreds of followers from which the real joker was born who became the arch nemesis of the batman. Joker is not about who is behind the mask but about the chaos which still passes down and is beyond his death.","

"Joker","cjs6547","5 November 2019","A real, raw and painfully guileless performance by Joaquin Phoenix contrasts with the captivating theatrics of Heath Ledger, and while the late actor achieved a beautiful onscreen presence, Phoenix delivers a new, memorably intimate take on the Joker.The story itself detaches from the usual comic book shenanigans and takes a serious, melodramatic route, which pointedly negates the black-and-white nature of good and evil. It's always tricky to try to garner sympathy for a villain by drawing on the tragedies in their past, but I think Joker safely accomplishes this, leaving us all conflicted. Some questions are answered in ways that leave the viewer unsatisfied and suspicious - a clever tactic to make each of us decide who we choose to believe.The direction and cinematography make this a captivating experience. Sudden events will elicit an awkward smile, while the rest is simply portentous and tragic.","

"Joker","lee_eisenberg","28 January 2020","One of the key tenets of superhero franchises is that there are well defined good guys and bad guys. But what if it weren't as simple as that? Todd Phillips's ""Joker"" subverts the genre, casting Batman's nemesis as the protagonist, portraying him as an abused, mentally unstable man at the end of his rope in a socially stratified Gotham City. We also get a different look at the Waynes: far from the upstanding citizen whom we expect, the dad is a heartless creep (servant Alfred isn't much better). It's one of the most intense movies that I've ever seen. Not at all like the comic book adaptations to which we're accustomed. It deserved its Golden Globe wins, and I'd say that it deserves at least one of the Oscars for which it's nominated.In addition to Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, there's also Robert DeNiro as a mean-spirited comic, Frances Conroy (of ""Six Feet Under"" and ""American Horror Story"") as the Joker's infirm mother, and a number of other people.","

"Joker","jelaniwilliams305","4 October 2019","When this film was announced, my initial thought was ""no one can come close to rivaling Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight'."" Let me tell you: Joaquin Phoenix give a phenomenal performance in ""Joker"" it'll be the biggest snub in Oscar history if he doesn't get nominated; he really dug deep for this one. As far as how it compares to Ledger's performance, it does, and it doesn't. It does because both will be talked about for years and will be considered some of the best performances in cinematic history that transcend any comic book movie portrayal by a long shot. Neither actor dialed in their performance; they each put the time and effort into making a unique interpretation of the character, which leads to the part where I mentioned that they don't compare because each version of the character are polar opposites of one another as far as their motives. Ledger's version was an agent of chaos; there was no reasoning behind his actions, he didn't have a clear backstory (it was multiple choice); he was just a guy that wanted to watch the world burn, and he portrayed that to perfection. Meanwhile, Phoenix's version, suffered from a mental illness all while being treated unfairly in life. We're taken through a series of tragic events through Arthur's perspective, that eventually push him over the edge and lead he to become the ""Clown Prince of Crime""; that was portrayed to perfection as well. Side Note: Robert De Niro was great too; even with the limited amount of screen time he had, he nailed the talk show host persona.The film itself is a SLOW burn. It's more of a character driven film that takes it's time to show you everything that happens in the titular characters life, which leads up to a BRUTAL finale. It's because of amount of breathing room this film has, it won't be for everyone; if you're expecting the usual, run-of-the-mill comic book film with tons of fighting scene, guns and explosions, you'll walk out severely disappointed. This is more of a drama/character study that lets you into Arthur's mind but once the chaos starts...OH BOY!!!!.The movie was shot really well; Todd Phillips made some great choices in this film from a direction standpoint; the lighting, certain scene transitions, zoom in/out shots were all terrific. I wouldn't mind seeing Phillips tackle more films like this one. Overall, Phoenix's performance alone was worth the price of admission; he was THAT good; however, as I stated earlier, the film takes a long time to develop, which I usually don't mind because I'm a very patient movie watcher, but if there comes a time where I'm thinking: ""that's been established, we can move on"" that's when I know they're taking a little too long and unfortunately, I had that thought a few times throughout. The good thing is the ending is really good and really established how Gotham became the chaotic, crime-ridden city we all are accustomed to and it shows why Batman is needed...","

"Joker","Michael Kenmore","11 October 2019","Normally I write the long review, but I'm going to keep it simple and concise this time.Without spoiling anything -- I suggest you do not read critics' reviews and watch this with a moderate expectation -- this film is an unexpected masterpiece, and the best comic book-based adaptation since Superman (1978).I have seen plenty of superhero movies, and I concur with Martin Scorsese's criticism of that as ""not cinema"" even though I differ with Scorsese's own output as self-indulgent and pretentious (in particular The Departed and Hugo were bloated and awful).However, Joker should be officially considered ""kino"" which is German for cinema, and utilized as a code of sorts among the Internet culture crowd to indicate ""encore; masterpiece; outstanding"".Watching this achieved something I did not expect, and that is of astonishment and catharsis. For that, my hat off to the reformed DC studio (which fired CEO after Justice League movie as a mega-flop to replace with a new leader) and Warner Bros that gave Todd Phillips and co. the chance to produce the bravest ""heavy and dark with the purpose"" cinema since, say, Fight Club, the latter I disliked but understood its messages.Joaquin Phoenix will not only own the Best Actor Oscar, but also that this film will sweep the Oscars with Todd winning Best Director and possibly Best Picture (Bradley Cooper being one of the producers).","

"Joker","Pjtaylor-96-138044","6 October 2019","'Joker (2019)' is one of the most intense and disturbing films I've seen in a long time. It really is surprisingly fantastic, an unsettling and complex character-study that's as uncompromising as it is gripping. Inspiration was clearly taken from 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' and, to a lesser degree, 'Taxi Driver (1976)', but this isn't just a cut-and-paste copy. It's very much its own beast, as much a horror movie as it is a comic-book one. Don't let Phillips fool you, by the way, this certainly is a comic-book movie. It's a phenomenal comic-book movie that blows almost all others out of the water, but a comic-book movie nonetheless. It takes inspiration from several well-known storylines and has a firm grasp on both its titular character and all the other classic Gotham elements, much more so than one might expect given the marketing. None of this is meant as a slight, just an exploration of the fact that comic-book movies are ""real"" movies. Here, we have a probable career-best performance from Phoenix, who's often frightening even when sitting still, and a definite career-best directorial effort from Phillips, who seems to have elevated himself far beyond the generally well-regarded 'The Hangover (2009)'. The whole thing is just so well-made, clearly crafted with absolute clarity of vision from the very beginning. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is gorgeous and the musical score is outright masterful. The flick works so well because it doesn't pretend there are 'heroes and villains'. You don't really identify with the protagonist, you pity him. You want him to be okay, to find a way out of his inevitably dark situation, but certainly aren't cheering along with him when things eventually get even worse. There's no 'good guy', just a guy. He undergoes some serious trauma and, often, the piece elicits a strong emotional response when this happens. Yet, when he decides to deal with it in a criminal way, you're never 'on his side'. Instead, you just watch in shock and horror, glued to the edge of your seat. Indeed, the violence here is some of the most impactful I've seen, each moment punching you straight in the gut. It's not fun, it's horrible and that's how it should be. There's no doubt that this is an amazing feature. It's absolutely gripping and I can't stress that enough. It gets under your skin and wriggles around, as interesting to reflect on as it is to watch. It's not exactly 'nice' but it's not supposed to be. It's brave, realistic stuff that's easily up there, right at the top, as one of the best of the year. As a footnote, I just can't believe how well they incorporated the Joker's classic laugh into a piece as grounded as this; it's chilling, tragic and integral to the character, yet still as over-the-top as you'd think (though, you might not realise it when it happens). Honestly, I still can't quite comprehend how good this whole affair is. It's simply divine.After a second watch, my option of the piece has dampened somewhat. It certainly doesn't have the impact that it used to. Plus, it clearly is a rip-off of 'The King Of Comedy (1982)' that Phillips, by his own admission, simply slapped a 'Joker' title on so that producers would take notice. Still, it's an effective film overall. It's just not as effective as I initially thought. I'll leave the rest of the review as it is, though, as I think there is some value in a 'first impression' of the piece; it clearly affected me the first time around, so deserves praise for that even if its impact has lessened on a rewatch.8/10.","

"Joker","pmtelefon","21 October 2019","It was refreshing watching ""Joker"" in the theater (AMC Raceway, Westbury, NY). It was really nice watching a movie that took a new approach to (somewhat) familiar material. It was nice seeing a movie that challenges the audience. For the most part, ""Joker"" succeeds in what it was trying to do. Writer/ director Todd Phillips and company deserve a lot of credit. The best thing about this movie is its look. It really feels like that time and place. The problem that I had with ""Joker"" is that it seemed to wear out its welcome after a while. Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. But if I was supposed to somehow sympathize with his character's plight, I didn't. I didn't really care about him or any of the other characters for that matter. When you watch a movie and don't really care about the people you're watching you can start to lose interest. I didn't look at my watch during ""Joker"" but I was tempted. Dishonorable mention: a miscast Robert De Niro.","

"Joker","zorrodg-316-238330","3 December 2019","Cinematography, costume design and one powerhouse performance do not a good movie make. In truth, Joker is poorly paced with a lackluster story that Frankenstiens together elements from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It borrows so liberally I'm amazed it didn't get hit with a plagiarism lawsuit.Additionally, the movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's sociological commentary is ham-fisted and bland, and it lacks any truly jaw-dropping moments. Outside of the Talk Show scene and a single shot near the end, it's all very forgettable.And the song for the stair dance sequence was so colossally stupid it completely pulled me out of the film.That being said, Joaquin was great and the aforementioned cinematography and costume design were very solid. All in all, the movie coasts on Phoenix's mesmerizing portrayal, but never goes far enough to really get under your skin. Biggest letdown of the year.","

This is the disturbing question the film poses in the figure of The Joker, equally fascinating, frightening and pitifully embodied by Phoenix, an unforgettable performance with great depth and a wide range of emotions: a Travis Bickle for the 21st century, and Robert De Niro himself paying tribute to this 43 years later after his own legendary performance in Taxi Driver.","

Phoenix is compelling in this role, and because of the types of roles he selects (dark characters), I doubt he will ever get the credit he deserves. I've reached the point where if Joaquin is in it, I'm watching.DeNiro on the other hand, is mailing it in as is his current style. That he plays a dopey game show host is somewhat fitting. If you know who Joe Franklin was, it is a pretty accurate portrayal, but sadly, Bobby has become a parody.You know what's coming, but not how its coming. I was very sympathetic to his character. He was a loner, subjected to lots of emotional abuse. Its really amazing, but it's not for everybody.","

"Joker","The-Sarkologist","7 October 2019","Well, this was certainly quite an anticipated movie, and just to think that it was made by the guy that came up with The Hangover. Then again this film is certainly not a pleasant movie by no means, but that certainly does not necessarily mean that it is a bad movie. Yeah, it is meant to make you feel really uncomfortable, and in a way you sort of also feel a lot of sympathy for the main character. In a way, by the end of the film, I am really wanting him to actually become the Joker, though of course this is all left in Limbo with the way the ending actually comes about.One thing I have to say is that Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely outstanding. I remember people suggesting that nobody could ever top Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, and of course there was Jared Leno who came along with Suicide Squad, yet Joaquin Phoenix truly moves this character to a completely new level. Yeah, we all suspected that the Joker was crazy, but the way Phoenix captures the dark insanity of the character, the way he captures his mental illness, is absolutely outstanding.Thus, what begs the question is, could he actually be the Joker that we all know and love (and if it wasn't for the fact that the Joker is a much loved villain we wouldn't have got this movie - in fact I'm not at all sure if there is any other villian out there that could literally have a movie of their own). The reason I say this is because Phoenix's Joker is seriously disabled, yet when we encounter the Joker elsewhere, while he might pretend to be crazy, he all know that he has his wits about him.The thing is that I don't believe that Phoenix's Joker could actually be the 'clown-prince of crime' because, well, I'm not entirely sure whether he is actually capable of interacting with people, let alone being the calculating criminal that he is famous for. The reason is that he really doesn't seem to be capable of being able to interact with people. In fact, he is more of a symbol, this is something that slowly becomes relevant as the movie progresses, until we get to the end. Of course, the ending is very ambiguous, and some of the suggestions that he is a joker as opposed to The Joker, really doesn't sit with me all that well.However, in a way it sort of makes sense, him being a symbol and all that. One suggestion, and it is a suggestion that I sort can agree with, is that he actually died in the car crash (something that isn't all that surprising considering he was hit by an ambulance on the side of the car in which he was sitting), and the crowds removed him carefully, as if he was some sort of martyr. Sure, the final scene certainly doesn't suggest that he is in heaven or anything, but the thing is that many characters literally take on a force of personality, one in which the actual person could never fulfill, and Arthur is certainly no leader, not in that sense of the word, and as such he can really only exist as a symbol.Yet we must remember that there is so much about this film that we simply do not know what is truth and what is hallucination. The thing is that Arthur is seriously disconnected from reality, that becomes pretty clear with the 'relationship' that he has with the woman down the hallway. Yeah, once that becomes clear, and it should not have been any surprise as all, it really throws into a lot of doubts what is actually happening, what is real and what is not. Then again, there are a lot of scenes going on in the background, which do give us hints that there certainly is a reality that is unfolding, which means that he certainly did kill the three men on the subway, and murdered Murray live on national television.Yet even Thomas Wayne, a character that is certainly not held in such high regard in this film, has an ambiguous side to him. Then again, in the other Batman films, we see so little of the character that he is seen as some angelic figure. Yet in this film, once again, the truth, and the reality, are two completely different things. Still, the whole question of whether he did have an affair with Arthur's mother, and that Arthur is actually his illegitimate son, is certainly thrown into a lot of doubt.So, yeah, this is a pretty awesome film, and it is certainly one of those films that is going to leave you thinking and trying to understand it for quite a while after leaving the cinema. Honestly, it is pretty good that we are starting to see more of these movies come into the cinema now, after a very long drought full of a bunch of quite sub-par action flicks.","

"Joker","dhunjiwadia","7 February 2020","Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies. This movie is about a character, not action or explosions. Joaquin Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and how power can be obtained. Todd Phillips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every other important aspect of the film. The movie gave me instant 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' vibes, without copying both films. This movie will drag you into your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better joker - Heath or Joaquin? The answer is - both did a phenomenal job. And Joker is fortunate to have being played by two phenomenal actors.

"Joker","cinema_lover97","7 October 2019","I miss Heath Ledger and can't get enough of his portrayal of Joker. He was intimidating, scary, unpredictable and all other things. In 2016, we got Suicide Squad and Jared Leto as Joker both of which disappointed me very much. After that, I thought that I don't want to see another Joker interpretation on the big screen. I was skeptical when I heard that a standalone Joker movie was in works. Then I heard about the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and I developed an interest in it because I love his work. He is a method actor and has given some of my favorite performances for example in Her (2013) and The Master (2012). I decided to see the movie in the theater after hearing a lot about the movie, good and bad and I am glad that I saw it.This movie is really good, it exceeded my expectations and Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his work. He is phenomenal and I was blown away by his performance. His performance alone carries the whole movie and lets you experience and understand the character without saying much. His physique, movements, gestures, grace, way of speaking suggests that he gave his everything to make the character compelling and stand out from other Joker portrayals. He lost 52 pounds for the role. He embodied the character of Joker. Comparing his performance with Heath Ledger will be absurd. There is no common ground for comparison. Both interpretations of Joker are significantly different, the story is different, character motivations are different.Now talking about the story, this is a standalone Joker movie that shows how a man beaten up, neglected and humiliated by the society turns into a maniac. This movie follows Arthur Fleck who works as a party clown and lives with his mother. He wants to be a stand-up comic. He suffers from a condition causing him to laugh uncontrollably. We feel his loneliness, depression, and condition and sympathize with him for it. All the other performances were also very good. This movie isn't that much violent as people are saying it to be, but it makes you feel the violence and it is unsettling. It also allows the viewer to form their perspective about the character. Sometimes you will agree with his actions and sometimes you won't. There are also certain funny scenes in the movie but not everyone may find it funny.The movie is directed by Todd Phillips and he has done an outstanding job. I didn't think that the guy who made The Hangover movies can pull this off, but he did it. He showed that as a filmmaker, he can make more than just R rated comedies. The film is set in 1981 and the period is very well reflected in the movie. The cinematography is top-notch. Shot composition, camera placement, camera movement has been handled well. I was surprised by how good the Gotham city looked, beautiful and dirty at the same time. Each scene had a color scheme. The lights in the surroundings like light from streetlights, cars or the sky illuminated everything with their light. Joker/Arthur Fleck's emotions get conveyed through shades of light falling on him which is beautiful to look at. Music is beautiful, chilling, hypnotizing and speak lengths about the inner feelings of the character.I have just a few issues with the plot of the movie and how some things happen which shouldn't have happened or couldn't have happened, rest the movie is flawless.","

"Joker","kemkomacar","29 December 2019","There are tons of reviews focusing on the extraordinary acting of Joaquin Phoenix, so I am skipping that part. I would like to make comments on the heated discussion that whether this movie glorifies the violence.Right off the ""bat"", I think it doesn't. Joker beautifully portrays how villains/monsters emerge and rise to power in a society.The dominant Western culture dictates that being good or bad is a completely personal choice and no society should be blamed for the rotten apples among them. On the other hand, leftist approaches tend to put the blame on the socio-economical structures of a society and they claim that the system produces such abnormalities.This fine piece of art takes a balanced attitude that blends the two extreme wiews summarized above. Arthur was a mentally disturbed person long before emerging as the Joker. He was delusional, depressed, and he had many social anxieties to prevent him of being a functioning member of a society. So, why did he become a villain, among many other troubled people? Because the society he lives in was corrupted and it was causing unrest. Ordinary people were already looking for an icon to channel their rages and discontent towards.So, for a true villain to rise, there must be a perfect combination of personal and sociological conditions. In the absence of psychological troubles, the villain candidate can't go the extra mile and endure such a depraving journey. On the other hand, in the absence of a truly corrupt and disgusting societal background, actions of a villain candidate would be considered unnecessary violent acts and as a result, the masses would not approve him/her. This is one of the main reasons why the people don't embrace lone wolf attacks nowadays. Despite all the problems they have, societies don't need a villain and that's why the villain candidates are mostly labelled as the depraved crazies.To wrap it up, the movie doesn't glorify the violence at all. It demonstrates the psychological and sociological conditions of a villain emerging and being widely accepted by an imaginary society. Actually, it's a free lesson for the policymakers all around the world. If you invest on the mental health of individuals and rule them fairly, the Joker can't be around.","

Robert DeNiro plays a talk show host and Zazie Beetz the friendly girl down the hall. Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce's rich father.""Joker"" (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics' villain, but it's more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain). The movie's captivating from the get-go and practically everything works for a broodingly superb cinematic experience.There are several amusing bits, but this ain't a fun flick. It's heavy and tragic. But what's the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He's a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber's ""Night of the Laughing Dead"" in Man-Thing #5 (1974).The movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).GRADE: A-/A","

"Joker","constelaciondelyra","6 July 2021","Not sure what others see in this movie. J. Phoenix delivers an amazing performance, yes, but that's basically all this movie has going for it. Ok, the cinematography is good and production values are high. But apart from this, the plot is boring and the references to Batman's universe feel forced. I watch the movie and only see a mentally unstable and sick man getting worse and worse, with a background of social unrest in the city. Also, the Joker was a cunning and cruel villain, so I don't think it's a good choice to make him start as a failed sad clown, where is the intelligence, the ambition? I don't think the clown is the core of this character, but rather a chosen aesthetic that has certain meaning. In summary, I find a disconnection between the character of the Joker in Batman and this guy that we see turning crazy here.","

"Joker","meanmrslinky","9 October 2019","Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker, in this jaw-dropping masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come. It proves to be more than just a comic book villains backstory. 'Joker' meticulously captures the gradual decline of one man's mental health, and shines light on the subject of mental health in general. There are points where you begin to sympathize with the madman. Despite some of the terrible acts he happily commits, you find yourself rooting for him which leads you to question your own morality. The world has viciously beaten this man down, and this is only the beginning of his retaliation.This is, without a doubt, Phoenix's best performance so far. He carries the entire movie flawlessly, and leaves you with a lot to talk about afterwards. The brilliant method actor ensures that people will feel this characters pain, and does not disappoint for one second. Robert De Diro, another brilliant method actor, gives a fine performance as Aurthor Fleck's favorite comedy talk show host, Murray Franklin. Though he's only in the movie for roughly 10-15 minutes total, he does a very well job at depicting a phony, belligerent, television personality. Brett Cullen also gives a fine performance as the billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, and has a part in Jokers madness.The word 'masterpiece' should never be thrown around lightly. It's a term we use to describe an outstanding, almost perfect, piece of art. There are only so many films that can be considered 'masterpieces'. Rarely do we ever see a flawless movie, especially this day in age. With that being said, it is hard to NOT consider 'Joker' a masterpiece. Every scene is just as important as the next, every actor delivers a wonderful performance, and Todd Phillips does an outstanding job directing the villains transformation. 'Joker' absolutely deserves a 10/10, and nothing short of that. This movie holds a mirror up to society; it should make you question what part society takes in one's slow drift into madness. This is very relevant to today, and is a perfect example of why something like this needs to be addressed and taken seriously. Everyone needs to see this movie. Again, it will be talked about for many years to come, and could very well be considered one of the greatest drama/thrillers of all time.","

"Joker","blr-btc","2 August 2021","A deep scan of reviews has fans that can understand depression become overwhelmed with empathy. There is a reason for everything, and understanding the context of a nostalgic character like the joker is what works.There was not a faithfulness to the scenes in Batman begins. Police chief introduces him during the outro as someone fairly unknown not a state wide celeb as played out in this film, that break in story continuity ruins it for me.Likewise the reinterpretation of Mr Wayne as something he never was. This takes away from the moral clarity of the pending superhero Batman.The greed narrative feels like its something that was force fed without rhyme or reason. While the joker had a substantial arc, the sub plots did not.Nostalgia is what brings the film to life, there is not many ways to not make money from iconic characters, this film should have been attempted years ago!Over the years Hollywood actors have been applauded for playing villians which is the easiest character study of them all. Whats hard is being protector of the realm without it feeling preachy or cheesy. These roles get a natural upscaling.The main plot element of inviting Arthur onto the talk show was not convincing, the stand up performance was not in the genre of 'so bad its good' his first vision from the audience defending his mother was however powerful and well written.A cameo for Alfred the butler would have been special and really pulled us back into the story.The ways this film was lauded in its first week was ridiculous, it does drag in many places over the 2hr hour screening.All the theatrical trailers were an 8 so many of us expected more. To say this is a better production than Batman Begins is shocking.The difficult reality to bare in this over hyped rating and cultural reality is many people in our age really feel like this and are on the verge of rioting after life takes its toll.The broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes is a great story that can be told a million ways, this was not executed well.The dream sequences worked well but the device was still not as good as Heath Ledgers raw portrayal of a psychopathic megalomaniac and the cinematography of Nolan in related films.Simple plot failures like the police not being able to catch up with Arthur who was not trying to be careful was disappointing and took me right out of the story.A good ensemble of actors can't save a bad script, why was this rushed to production? Something as important as Batman origin stories need much more careful work. I believe over time this score must average out and down.Was this an homage to ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The King of Comedy"" apparently not. The opportunity for genuine franchise building was surprisingly tossed away and will be hard to repair.Critics who use the word 'masterpiece' and
'groundbreaking' need to have a long hard look at themselves, their surroundings and the education that they all seem to share. There is F all diversity in this mob who keep playing us.","

I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get.","

They're extremely biased and are simply hating this movie because people like it and because they expect it to be something that it isn't.Things you MUST know before you watch the movie is that this isn't a ""Batman"" movie. It's not an action movie. If you're expecting a ton of action and explosions and a lot happening then this isn't the right movie for you.This movie is a drama. It's a drama about a man named Arthur and how he became ""Joker."" It doesn't really go into details or explore his childhood. The movie is about a very small portion of Arthur's life that happened just right up to before he becomes ""Joker."" The premise is pretty simple and not overly complicated.The reason this movie is loved is because it's beautifully shot and executed. The acting is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the score is chilling, the art and flow is very poetic. This is not a movie you watch with your eyes. This is a movie that you must watch with your mind. It goes deep into the human psyche. It presents simple things in a different light. It dances, literally AND figuratively between light and dark, good and bad, right and wrong. You have to pay attention or you'll miss the message.I enjoyed the movie and I believe it's a type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience.

"Joker","mkm-hermanjnr","20 October 2021","I'll be honest, I was avoiding seeing ""Joker"".At first it seemed to me that it was going to be yet another comic book movie in a cinematic landscape saturated to bursting point with bland comic book movies.Then I was a little fed up with the constant tiresome media spam the film was getting because it was so ""controversial"". These events conspired to make me feel less than enthusiastic about watching it.Well, two days ago I changed my mind, put it on and the rest is history.Joker is a phenomenal film. It's such an intriguing in-depth study of mental illness, social inequity and the inability of people of different social classes to understand each other that I was really quite blown away. It's a movie that has far more in common with classic intelligent cinema than modern day CGI-loaded blockbusters.Following mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck, the movie chronicles his heart-wrenching descent into sociopathic villainy, catalysed by the decaying and uncaring social environment of Gotham City.Joaquin Phoenix does a brilliant job here, honestly one of the best acting performances I've ever seen. Arthur can be defined most reliably by one word: ""Pain"".Arthur's entire existence is emotional pain. Almost everyone he meets treats him like garbage. Those who do not treat him poorly still cannot even begin to understand his struggle with mental illness.When he bursts out in sheer frustration to one character, voice cracking, with the line ""I don't know why everyone is so rude? I don't know why you are? I don't want anything from you!"" it hurts, because we've seen the way Arthur is treated and it's absolutely true.Yet at the same time, Arthur's point of view is unreliable and inaccurate. We can understand *why* people treat him poorly - because he is creepy and eccentric without realising. This leads to a masterful dramatic situation in which we completely empathise with Arthur's pain but also understand precisely why this pain becomes a perpetual loop.When Arthur's final singular comfort, his love for his mother, is brutally stripped from him, the end result is one of the most heart-breaking scenes I've seen in a film.The film's pace is slow but with good reason. I was becoming restless with the misery of the first half of the movie, but the final half (and especially the final act) builds to an enormous climax that justifies every ounce of build up that preceded it.My favourite scene in the whole movie is perhaps the most iconic - Arthur in his full ""Joker"" regalia, dancing down the same steps he has struggled to climb up repeatedly throughout the film.This scene works on so many levels to highlight the most horrifying aspect of the film - Arthur's mental salvation, his total liberation, in the end does not come from positivity. It does not come, as in the case of a ""coming of age"" movie, from fixing his problems and becoming happy.No, Arthur's charisma, happiness and total lack of concern in his new persona comes from suicidal ideation and a complete lack of care for anything. His problems finally break his sanity completely, to the point where happiness and sadness don't mean anything to him anymore. The man dancing merrily down the steps has lost his soul, and he's smiling about it.I won't say anymore about the film for risk of spoiling it for those who have not seen it. But I will end this review by saying that the entire hysterical media response to this movie and how it will ""encourage violence"" is utter nonsense.Joker has the complete opposite message: understand the people around you. Show them compassion, even if they seem unworthy of it on the surface. Don't judge others based on their social status or what you see on TV. And above all, realise that your opinion of others is based off your experience and limited knowledge, and isn't necessarily accurate.Perhaps that's the true reason why mass media outlets dislike this film. Because it encourages developing the virtues the modern reactionary media seems to lack.","

"Joker","BobbyGuts","7 October 2019","Overall Great movie!!! (writing, direction, acting)
I am excited to see if it's strength raises the bar for newer releases.
It's plot sings the blues of the jokers story and does so with nostalgic aesthetics- combining ""Taxi driver"" psycology with a ""King of Comedy"" theme (Coincidently two movies starring De Niro & directed by Scorsese).
The emphasis was heavy on the mental illness and misfortunes of Arthur Fleck but unexplored were the entertaining/ musicality traits of a joker.
The playfulness that was expressed through the character seemed more-so of Joaquin Phoenix and less in the spirit of Joker.
Throughout the movie the Joker is portrayed as self conscious and the resolution/ climaxed rebellion is an out-cry from that- not so much on his real connection to Gotham or a villainous reign.
That said I don't see this Joker bright enough to be an infamous, self sustaining, street-wise villain.","

We've been overdue on having a proper masterpiece film out there and this one delivers. A movie that causes you to think and still leaves you thinking about why those events happened in the film or even real life. Leaves you thinking about why it's important to know both sides of a situation - of course this is a lesson that the Batman lore has always had, hence the villains having interesting backstories. There's so much to take in with this film, did you ever expect that from a comic book movie ? Much less a DC film ?! Batman has always been (to me at least) the most interesting story in the comic book world, because the villains are as interesting (if not more) than the hero. So many film adaptations have been made, but this one finally does an outstanding job exploring the story's most complex character. Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise for his take on this character. He got the mannerisms, looks, and ticks of a mentally unstable person down to a T, it's so natural and not cheesily forced - the guy is phenomenal. Whether people like it or not, we needed this film. No matter if you're part of the overly sensitive brigade that censors everything or an online edgelord who mocked this film for critiquing sOciEty, you need to watch this film - there's a valuable lesson in it for both of you.

Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say.","

And, for one and a half hours, this film felt like it was ""beating a dead horse"" - Arthur is mentally ill, in a desperate time, with no more social services. And he's slipping into madness. Pause, repeat, repeat, for nearly 90 minutes. It's dark and traumatic, but its also boring, at that length. Phoenix does a good job of it, sort of combining Buffalo Bill from ""Silence of Lambs"" with the emaciated body of Trevor Reznik from ""The Machinist"", and to good effect, but no one could have kept that up in an interesting manner for that long.The last half hour is better, and lays a solid foundation for how the Joker gains power, almost despite himself. His look, and his laugh, turn more to the classic version of the character and has more of the feel of the Joker I grew up with. But, I don't know that I'd watch this again, and certainly not as often as I've re-watched ""The Dark Knight"" since it came out. This almost might have been a better movie if it wasn't about the Joker at all, and just about some how some crazy man came to be and came to power. Knock, knock...","

I don't sympathize with the main character at all, throughout the whole movie he would get on my nerves. I was waiting entire time for the plot to start revolving and when it finally did, the movie was over and left me with a feeling that I've waisted two hours of my life on nothing. For a movie with this high rating I expected to see something fresh and inspirational and somehow it seems to me all the scenes and acting I've seen in this movie I saw a thousand times in bunch of other movies, like it was cliche after cliche.

"Joker","gnc6971","18 October 2019","I see a lot more great reviews for this now but when it first came I saw a lot of hate. I don't understand that at all, those people to me only wanted an action movie as they apparently didn't have the intelligence to understand a psychological thriller like this. As I stated, this wasn't trying to be an action movie, it wanted to show the Jokers transformation from harmless crazy guy down the street to full on psychotic criminal kingpin. I don't think this is really a major spoiler, but I loved how we were able to see young Bruce Wayne's story unfold in the background as well! I told my sister when we talked about a sequel that if she wanted to know what happens next, go straight to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, then you'll be able to watch two brilliant performances in a row as the Joker, (You were awesome, too, Bale, but this is about the Joker- lol). and basically see the whole story of his life in those two movies. But, that's not to say I'm not onboard with a Joker sequel! I think this is in the running, if not the front runner, for my best movie if the year, but I'll have to sit down and have a look at all the others I've seen! Awesome flick!","

"Joker","kane_1371-117-231060","6 October 2019","This movie is an intense dive into our dysfunctional societies that has taken a turn for the worse.
To think the director behind such absurd film like Due Date and Hangover (Not that anything is wrong with those films) would even be willing to make this film in itself is amazing.
Joker puts our ugly side under the spotlight and makes you wonder where does a society draw the line.
Those that have watched the Swedish film The Square know that this is a concept that many film makers have worked on for so many years.
Joker is just the darkest side of this story and question.
this line the I am talking about is not the line of justifying the character of Joker but the line that eventually leads to making a person like Joker come to life.
This movie constantly paints that picture, where is the line?
Where do you put a stop to it?
How could you have prevented this from happening?
The movie opens with a clearly already broken man prisoner to the society and the system that is not willing or able to help him.
Joker's situation is already beyond dire and further down the line you learn about all the happenings that lead to this broken man.
The film maker and the actor never paint a heroic picture of Joker, he is not glorified by the movie.
He is presented as the byproduct of a society that is eerily familiar.
Because whether we like it or not we all are responsible for one another.
We all affect each other's lives in ways that we can never imagine and psychological health is to this day a subject that is scoffed at even by the brightest and most free thinking people.
No one likes to see where the monster comes from because we do not want to have the blaming finger turned on us.
We just want the monster among us shunned, chained and caged and hanged.
It is a fact that our failing societal relationships are leading to psychological illnesses and in extreme cases to violent outbursts.
Most of these outbursts are introvert and almost nobody pays any attention to them but the extrovert ones are always scoffed at when doctors talk about the need to study and understand them.
This is the world that creates Joker which is portrayed and criticized here.
Leaving that subject behind lets talk about Joaquin Phoenix.
This man is a wonder.
I have followed his work through out the years watching him as he evolved with every movie he played and today when you watch Joaquin play Joker you see him through out his career.
You see him in Gladiator, you see him in Ladder 49, you see him in Her.
He has grown with every movie to the point where he creates this amazingly authentic performance for the audience to take part in.
From the very first line, the mimicry, the slightest movement he is the character that he is portraying and he is Joker by the end of the movie.
You can hear this pained and sick man, you can see his break point, you can feel his struggles and that makes this performance just exceptional.
I am not going to even compare this performance, it really is an entirely different beast and by far one of the best performances I have seen in the recent years and easily the best Joker performance to this day.
Lets go into the music...what can be said except intense?
Something that I loved was the music choices, they really did convey the world's personality to me as audience.
From the jazzy tones of the New York city life (as we know Gotham is basically New York and Chicago mixed into an unholy union) to the musics chosen to deliver the mood of the scene or character it felt really fitting and good.
Then we come to the original sound track and we are basically dealing with a drama horror or thriller soundtrack with suspenseful moments and intense moments that makes you sit straight in wait for the impending explosion of events.
This is Joker, every camera shot, every movement and every sound is there to make you wait for the right moment that it goes ""BANG"" and puts something new on your lap and this movie has several of those.
This is Joker, a movie that studies what elements in a society can lead to the creation of people like Joker and Batman and in my humble opinion this movie delivered on this at every front possible.
I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie to anyone that is a fan of Cinema and good films in general.","

"Joker","shirjil","31 August 2019","Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.
Clearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed ""Fear City.""This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself ""God's lonely man"" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.
The Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.","

"Joker","aweynand96","7 October 2019","The people have hoisted this movie high onto a pedestal - and those that haven't have grabbed their pitchforks. This film has arrived during a bewildering time in our country and the world at large, a time when shootings feel more prevalent than ever and months-long protests in Hong Kong have gained international recognition. Given the context, and the importance of the pivotal movement occurring in the new Joker movie's Gotham, some have claimed the film promotes not just protest, but violent protest. I think that's blasphemy. Sometimes, a movie is just a movie. Controversy has been a staple of some dynamic proportion of new films since the dawn of moving pictures, and that doesn't always mean the message is supposed to invoke violence from the masses. Keeping this in mind - and thus watching Todd Phillip's ""Joker"" as entertainment and not an invitation to anarchy - I can say honestly that it was an absolute blast.Nobody is surprised that Joaquin Phoenix was up for taking on the role. He's a phenomenal actor with an impressive range; just watch him play Freddie Quell in 2012's ""The Master"" and then Theodore in 2013's ""Her"" and try to deny his scope of talent. What is surprising is just how enrapturing and satisfying his performance as Arthur Fleck turned out to be. Whatever misgivings you may have about the eruption of violence that occurs around his version of the Joker, Phoenix absolutely elevates this movie, and is impossible (almost to a fault, but not quite) to look away from him. He plays a broken man with a damaged past, and is so completely engrossing, so stunningly bleak, that it makes the film worth watching, and then watching again. Without spoiling anything, I can assure you that his arc is a triumph to behold, and I was clinging to every devilish smile, shocking moment, and chilling laugh that flashed across the screen. He's not trying to kick off an uprising for political gain; he just wants to share his bafflement of society's awfulness with the rest of the world.Okay, so the performance was master-class, but was the film a masterpiece? Not in my opinion; the theme of rising discontent with the rich and/or powerful is an old one, and it's beaten with a ham fist at times here. But damn if it isn't difficult to admit that given how gripping and show-stopping the titular character turned out to be. And though he's the best part of the movie by a long-shot, he's not the only great thing that ""Joker"" has going for it. The film is interwoven with a harrowing score written by the same composer that worked on ""Arrival"", ""Sicario"" and ""Chernobyl"", and the music manages to pierce the air at all the right moments, heightening the intensity where it is appropriate and pinning suspense for as long as we can stand it. I have no complaints about the rest of the cast because they are all great (and would you guess this is Robert De Niro's highest grossing opening ever?). The movie is indeed dark, at times nihilistic and very often just bleak, but Phoenix screams ""NUTS to that"" and revels in the blackness as his tragedy-turned-comedy character transforms into a cackling murderer.The critics have complaints: That Joaquin Phoenix was trying too hard, and that the themes were overt and annoyingly crass. I'd like to point out that acting your heart out isn't always trying too hard, and trying too hard doesn't always make you a great actor anyways. While his performance certainly does not feel effortless, I never once rolled my eyes - I was captivated. As for the heavy-handed ""message"", I say please - this is still a comic book movie. I'm not sure what you expected.7.5/10 for the best performance of 2019 in a Cedar Point thrill of a film.","

"Joker","blackmamba99971","17 July 2020","It's not every year that an actor can get to the top with a unique role. Playing the fictional character the Joker has been tried for many decades by various actors but the closest one to the original was Heath Ledger who won an oscar for the role. Now, it's Joaquin who has taken the lead. A disenchanted individual who tries to cope with life as it hands out grime and dirt in its most ruthless form, starts to take it's toll on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin) who was adopted by his disillusioned mother who suffered severe psychiatric problems. Stemmed with endless turmoil in Gotham, Arthur begins to realize what life has to offer. Yet none of it gives Arthur a sense of relief except when he kills starting with three thugs on a subway line. From then on, his mind clears away the hazy images that his medications blocked him with, to advance further and further into his own existential madness.
I found this version of the Joker to be very gratifying, especially as Joaquin nailed the comic clown's persona to a perfect 'T'. Becoming Gotham's crown prince of crime in upsetting the natural order of things as we see it normally. Such as politics, monetary issues, or just living day to day in a world of chaos brimming with upheaval and despair that surrounds us all. Director, Todd Phillips was brilliant in showing us the gritty, dirty streets laced with crime in all corners. Not just the for the elite, but for all levels of humans who want to escape but can't for reasons of either insanity or just plain nostalgia that all people relate to when they move into a new corner of the world.
It is a clear reminder that for the most part, people from all walks of life can only stand so much criticism when they do their jobs, or need to be recognized for their value or contributions to society. When such acts of decadence leaks inward to affect the common man, then the little things begin to build incrementally until it reaches the point of critical mass.
Todd Phillips captured this brilliantly. The music was an incredible match using the early era of the seventies and eighties as a catalyst to the Joker's rise to fame. It helped his madness, it helped mould his persona into the devious creature that helped purge out the elite to their own wasteland while at the same time, had given birth to the Batman. This was an incredible movie, from start to finish. Lots of emotional turmoil, sadness, mind bending plots as to why Arthur plunged into the abyss of chaos. I recommend this film to all fans of the Joker franchise. It doesn't hold a lot of violence, but when it's needed, Phillips delivered perfectly to balance the story's theme.","

"Joker","krocheav","7 August 2020","How easily pleased have some people become? When a 'major' movie is this simplistic and obviously just another copy of many other overrated downers - it leaves someone needing to explain how this nonsense then goes on to rate a ridiculous 11 Oscar nominations? Who can truly take the Oscars seriously any longer? Joker is a typical super-ugly, comic book R Rated serial killer story - which grinds its endless way through non-stop, grotesque situations of the most maudlin kind. We've already seen this character (somewhat over-played by Phoenix) far too many times in the past. Even the dark, sleazy settings don't invite interest, and has left many viewers wanting it all to end quickly but no, it drags on for over two hours, feeling painfully more like three.Then there's the casting of an over-used De Niro, intended to help capitalise on some of those 'gangster- obsessed' Scorsese offerings. Many paid to see this over-hyped lowbrow tosh, expecting to experience a masterpiece - only to wish they could get back their time and money for better use.If uninspired morbidity is your thing, you'll get a bellyful - otherwise, stay well away and watch this junk fade into the obscurity it deserves, hopefully, along with the copycat movie makers. The final images this movie creates of carnage on the streets of America, looks more like the sorry, robotic BLM mayhem that's reducing the USA to a decaying mess. Just what the CCP and others would be quite happy to see - Civil War. Such a pitiful shame and a sick joke.","

"Joker","CineMuseFilms","28 December 2019","If you have been avoiding the movie Joker (2019) because you think it belongs to the superhero genre and the violent world of masked crusaders then you are making a mistake. Just like I did. Set aside preconceptions and see what is one of the most powerfully introspective portraits of mental illness you will ever find on film - and Batman is nowhere to be seen.Set in Gotham City in the recent pre-digital age, the story opens with Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to live a normal life, hold a job, and care for his ageing mother. Abused as a child, he relies on medication for his cocktail of mental disorders, the most prominent of which is a condition where anxiety can trigger bursts of hysterical laughter (Pseudobulbar Affect). City Hall cuts back on support services and Arthur's untreated conditions escalate as he becomes more vulnerable to abuse, loses his job, and his dream of becoming a stand-up comic is cruelly exploited. With nothing to gain or lose, all that is left is vengeance.
This plotline is merely a narrative framework for what is a phenomenal performance by Phoenix. His chiselled features, balletic body language, and elastic facial contortions have extraordinary power to express disconnectedness from the material world. As he endures the torments of an uncaring society, we become immersed in his value system where violence makes perfect sense.The film was always going to generate controversy for its depiction of violence. However, it remains on the 'art' side of gratuitous and is more restrained than so many other violent but non-controversial films. The soundtrack and cinematography are edgy, and the camerawork is often so close to Arthur you can see the pores of his skin sweating fury at those around him. The film is visually engrossing: the sets ooze gothic decay, dystopian chaos, and streets full of vagrants and the dispossessed. The film's two-hour running time feels like one.Phoenix single-handedly drives this film and he deserves critical acclaim. It was risky to bypass the usual magical fantasy of super-heroes and super-villians and take a serious look at a serious issue. Entertainment can be a powerful platform for education. While the script retains the tropes of Marvel Comics, it shows insight into mental illness with lines like ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? What you deserve"".","

Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic however and the film has all the top production values that you'd expect of a big studio picture but it's generic and predicable in my opinion. It takes from so much that it's not it's own film for me. By no means is the film awful, it's just soulless. I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse and against the tide of support for this film either, there are things as I've mentioned to commend and I'd like to add that going the way of gritty R rated film making is what I've wanted for years, from a more dramatic viewpoint, I thought ""Logan"" did what this film failed to do for me as a darker comic book oriented film. I hope people can respect my opinion just as I respect the free speech of everyone who really liked the film. Finally, I will add that those who have bashed the film for violence do not know what they're talking about. There are far more violent films than this and if one person or even a handful of people were incentivised to cause harm to others, the rest of us shouldn't have to pay for the odd few thank you very much. It's an interesting watch for certain and I'd recommend watching for that reason alone.","

"Joker","harryplinkett14","4 March 2020","Characters that suffer abuse can be a good element in a plot. But audience should never suffer abuse. The audience needs to experience catharsis in the end. And this never happens with 'Joker'. The film has a huge problem, which it never manages to solve: it wants to be realistic and tell the tale of an innocent, abused individual who snaps; but it also wants to exist within a fictional universe in which this man is as much of an abuser as he is a victim. And this creates problems for the screenwriters that they never manage to solve. Thus Joker comes across as a sympathetic character first, but turns to a vicious killer towards the end, at which point everyone becomes confused, and stops liking him. There is no redemption of any kind, no satisfying emotional resolution, only a brutal ending which serves the purposes of the wider franchise and doesn't deliver on its own terms. In the end, the character we were made to empathize with becomes nothing but a caricature in a silly superhero universe. And that is an insult to anyone who invested in the character from the beginning. The audience is cheated. Also, one should note the disturbing anarchist/communist vibe in the film - the idea that it's better to burn down the world than allow their particular understanding of 'injustice' to go on. I may pity Joker and hate the cynical Wayne, but I won't put degenerate, mentally ill clown in charge of an angry mob that wants to burn everything down.","

"Joker","chasemykleby","5 October 2019","""Joker"" Review
(9.5/10)I was close to giving this movie a ten out of ten, but then I thought to myself is it wrong for me to think that Joker is brilliant and unsettling all in one? Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself.
""I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,"" whispers Arthur, who's also on seven different types of medication and has been in the system for most of his life. A system that now has no resources or time for him. A desperate whisper that you know won't be heard by anyone. That simply signifies the beginning of both a descent and his path to becoming the Joker. This is ultimately what Joker is: an origin story. One that touches only ever so lightly on what has come before in the DC Universe. This could, particularly in the current climate, be viewed as a lament for outsiders and the ignored. That's too simple and Joker does anything but deliver you easy answers. It's a sad, chaotic, slow-burn study of someone who isn't visible; who doesn't even exist to the world around them. But your empathy, sympathy even, isn't guaranteed, and it begins to dissolve as Arthur somehow moves even further to the edges. This is, we mustn't forget, the story of how a villain was made.
As Arthur/Joker, Joaquin Phoenix is astonishing. Phillips has said he had a picture of the actor above his screen when writing the script and it's a belief that has paid off. Phoenix inhabits Arthur: having lost weight for the role, he looks thin, frail, hungry. Shadows carve out his exposed bones. His physicality is precise, the way he moves, shuffles, runs, sits, smokes, shrinks. His usual intensity is on full display and it's captivating, even overwhelming in moments. While this is Phoenix's film, Frances Conroy is quietly devastating as Arthur's mother Penny, and Zazie Beetz, as neighbour Sophie Dumond, while arguably underused, brings vital humanity to her scenes with Arthur. The most talked-about piece of casting was obviously Robert De Niro as late-night TV host Murray Franklin.
Mention must be made of Joker's cello score by Hildur Guðnadóttir: mournful, dark and fractured, and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher. In his hands, Gotham is alive as a flawed, brutal, broken-hearted character in its own right.
Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.","

"Joker","donnielovesmovies","7 October 2019","Joker (2019)9.5/10🤡🎭💄""Dark, violent and so full of truth, Joker takes a new approach on the backstory trope, creating a very grand accomplishment of a film that will go down as one of the greats of all time.""The societal factors that surround us are what shape the everyday lives of any man or woman that walks the ground of the earth. Joker just so happens to be glorius yet horrifyingly realistic depiticion of the various ""what ifs"" in our dysfunctional world. Granted, this film is a origin story of one of the most beloved antagonists in cinema and comic book history, however, the film also holds a very vital meaning in its delivery. With the help of a Joaquin Phoenix career defining performance, we are able to see the slow dip into insanity of the average man who'd be the least expected to morph into a monstrous villain by the hand of society, caused by neglection. Todd Phillips is a damn genius, and again proves to us that a comedic mind can also hold the most grim ideas. He most certainly proves this by delivering the fun additives, which would be the clever use of violence that is more artsy than controversial (people exaggerate so much it sickens me), a discomforting atmosphere that leaves you feeling the anxiety you never knew you could feel; like watching Taxi Driver times 5, and an ending that you never knew a third act could pull off so masterfully, it becomes more unforgettable than one could imagine. Joker has easily, and most effortlessly, claimed the throne of Movie of the Year.Verdict: Joker is the masterpiece we all knew it would be. Even if the Clown Prince of Crime isn't your cup of tea, I suggest watching this movie anyways because it's not just a movie, it's a reality.","

"Joker","perica-43151","5 October 2019","There is a reason why this masterpiece is being panned by the crony capitalist critics. It challenges their all too comfortable fake construction of reality and it does so in such an effective way, that it almost automatically elicits a bad faith defensive reaction from them, frightened to the bone that their charade might get uncovered. Joker might be delusional, but it is they that sell delusions in order to maintain the status quo.
But, eventually, and they know it, you get what you deserve. That sentence and that sentiment is what so scares them, because this movie cuts too close to the bone, and like all great, game-changing art, it is just a bit too true.
When Joker, who is a true hero here, helps a character, equally mistreated by the powers that be, go free, he points that he was the only one that treated him well. This is a call for kindness that is essence of the movie, but it is barely noticed by those who, like the villain of the movie, Thomas Wayne, think we are all despicable clowns. So they lie and pool wool over our eyes, as they only can, misconstrue and make false scares, so that the point of the movie that is most damaging for them would not get across.All these are marks of a great movie. In Europe, it was instantly recognized - and rewarded, for the subversive potential it has. In North America, it scared the hell out of conformists, and the reaction was, for many, an almost reflexive rejection. Which means it hit, it hit hard, quite uncomfortably so. And if anything the hypocrites hate so much, it is the movie that exposes them, and, even more so, exposes the paper tiger of the blood sucking system they depend on for what it is.","

"Joker","omkar1984","4 October 2019","A film with a laudable performance by Phoenix. The film highlights several unpleasant aspects:
1. The PBA disturbance which I doubt the masses(which includes me) are aware of and the traumatic life such a person may lead
2. The effects of the lack of medication for such a disturbance or the effectiveness of such medicines, in first place
3. The never-ending saga of bullying
4. The general insensitivity of the media and talk show hosts.The background score of the movie is good but is an overkill.The screenplay of the movie, the themes and the in general the origin story/retrofit is not only unconvincing and flawed but also seems to deliver a wrong message.
1. The obsession of linking Joker/Fleck to the Wayne family - Fleck's mother's history, Wayne Enterprise employees beating up Fleck and finally the ideological assassination of the Wayne family by a protester
2. Fleck being adopted and having suffered childhood abuse is such a lame and clichéd plot aspect used by the writers
3. Plausible:
Lack of medication, disturbing discoveries and sort of revenge causes Fleck to go on a killing spree and even enjoying the attention that he receives unexpectedly
Implausible:
Social commentary by Fleck on the show, his sudden liking to riots and chaos. I couldn't believe that they send a detective/psychiatrist to meet Fleck in jail but she's unaware of his disorder and thinks that a PBA-suffering Fleck is laughing at some joke!! Seriously? Are the police and other agencies do dumb to not investigate history of such a criminal?
4. While it's unfair to go into too much of details, I don't understand how a person who likes to dance and become a stand-up comedian would end up having a predilection and some talent in chemical weapons, dynamite, explosives etc. Which are Joker's speciality? Is the viewer supposed to assume that the Fleck cultivates these skills from scratch after he turns into 'Joker'?
5. Last but the most important point - Joker, as we know since ages, is a class-I psychopath who feels no remorse or emotions and enjoys killings and chaos. While such psychopaths get a bit influenced by their surroundings, they are genetically/pathologically having some issues that makes them what they are. In this movie, they somehow try to come up with a cocktail of reasons that give rise to Joker. The worse part is the that riots, vandalism and criminal activities are portrayed as a natural outcome of expressing your discontent.Overall, the movie is a poor origin story of an iconic psychopath like Joker. Watch it as an independent psychological thriller but not as a 'Rise of Joker' film.","

"Joker","ryanphelantv","26 September 2019","Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come. This is less ""The Dark Knight"" and more ""Taxi Driver"" but make no mistake, it feels like the most original take you have ever seen on a well-worn genre. It is an uber-violent character study of a mentally ill man trying to survive in a bleak society that is failing him. It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film. I hope people continue to see it as a cinematic masterpiece and it doesn't get caught up in politics or become part of a narrative of the sometimes flawed society we live in ourselves.","

Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial.

I admit that it's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker, but it's still awesome. The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called ""THE Joker"". The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in ""The Dark Knight"", but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2","

"Joker","zkonedog","14 October 2019","After seeing the credits roll on ""Joker"", it took me a bit to figure out my exact feelings towards it. On one hand, there is nothing inherently bad about the film, and it certainly is a new/fresh way to examine that character's backstory mythos. On the other hand, however, there is also a thought that nagged me which said that something was a bit ""off"" about the whole thing. The conclusion I've come to is that while ""Joker"" is a legitimate take on his origins, it just isn't the #1 (or even #2) take that I prefer.For a basic overview, this film focuses on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring stand-up comedian who works as an entertaining clown to support himself. Arthur clearly also has some some of mental illness, including the propensity for laughter when the emotional situation does not call for it. The combination of all these factors sees Fleck mistreated or put down by society at nearly every step of his Gotham-dwelling existence. After perpetuating a subway murder and then being embarrassed on live television by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the late-night talk show host he idolizes, Fleck transforms himself into the tragically comedic figure Batman fans know well.I actually have more respect than most, I think, towards the validity of this ""take"" on The Joker. It is easily the most gritty and true-to-life that has ever been attempted at this point. Basically, WB and director Todd Phillips are saying ""here is how a real-life Joker figure could spring up"", right down to explaining the makeup and predilection towards uncontrollable laughter. In and of itself, there really isn't anything ""wrong"" with this take.That being said, I still prefer Ledger's mysterious Joker of ""The Dark Knight"" or even Nicholson's mob-leader Joker of ""Batman (1989)"". Acting performances strictly aside for the moment, I just don't know about--and feel a little uncomfortable with--the Joker being a tragic figure. I prefer the comic-book approach of Nicholson falling into the vat of chemicals, or the air of mystery surrounding where exactly Ledger's Joker came from. Having this Phoenix Joker spring from a place of potential sympathy? However legitimate that take may be, I just don't like it as much.There are also a few frustrating choices that hold back the overall story of the film:
-A subplot involving Arthur's neighbor down the hall (played by Zazie Beetz) goes absolutely nowhere and ends up meaning very little.
-The shoehorning of the Wayne family into the movie. Did we really need to see the Waynes murder again?! That's becoming a parody of itself at this point. Plus, scenes that feature Fleck and any member of the Wayne family feel like pandering to the Batman crowd rather. The cherry on top, of course, is the insinuation (true or false) that Fleck may actually be a Wayne family relation. Again, that's taking the ""easy way out"" when it comes to crafting this story.Fortunately, ""Joker"" does enough things right to make it watchable. It isn't boring by any means, the music and overall production value is great, and Phoenix does give a great performance. For the tone of the character that Phillips is trying to create, Phoenix is marvelous, actually.Overall, though, I only moderately enjoyed this take on the Joker mythos. Maybe, had this been the first attempt at doing so, I'd feel differently. But as it stands, it comes down to me liking other interpretations of the character more than this one.","

"Joker","CinemaClown","10 October 2019","Put on a happy face and smile coz with Joker, the greatest comic-book supervillain at last gets his very own origin story, and it is exactly how it must be: Dark, bleak, deranged, manic, wretched & downright nihilistic. Also, with no good to counter the evil this time around, it is a full-on descent into madness & hysteria that viewers are either gonna detest or embrace wholeheartedly.Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, this standalone take on the origins of the iconic arch nemesis attempts to create his psychological profile by painting a grisly portrait of an unstable mind that's hanging by a thread on the edge of insanity until he finally snaps. Discarding the existing blueprint of its genre, this reincarnation of Joker offers a low-budget, grounded treatment but with hugely rewarding dividends.Though Phillips' direction could dig into Joker's unhinged persona to only a certain extent, Joaquin Phoenix's chilling rendition of the eponymous psychopath bridges the gap and overcomes the few nitpicks with thrilling intensity, for he is gripping & breathtaking throughout. Other vital inputs come from the story's nihilistic tone & treatment, its grim atmosphere, sudden brutal violence, and Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score.Scarier than most horror films of today, Joker bestows the notorious madman with an origin story that's as plausible as it is cold & callous, and makes for an insanely riveting character study that works even if one strips the premise off its comic book roots. Driven by Joaquin Phoenix's powerful, unsettling & memorable performance, this cautionary tale of a psychotic who in search for identity mistakenly becomes a symbol is arguably the best film of the year.","

"Joker","begob","3 February 2020","In a city seething with class antagonism, the mental illness of a struggling clown flourishes into messianic and murderous insanity.Woah! That's a bold story, and the lead role does it justice, as the character becomes a sort of hall-of-mirrors reprise of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, with uncanny poses and dance moves. And of course, de Niro is present too, with shades of The King Of Comedy.But you can see the problem right there, with all the emphasis on the actors and not so much on story or theme. It is engaging, and well paced and edited, but a bit linear and simplistic. Maybe comic book heroes are fit only for comic books, and expecting them to take on the injustices of the American Way is to ask too much. At least they had the guts to go for it.On reflection, I think maybe the concept started in too low a gear - if you state that we live in a crazy, mixed-up system, the audience is already with you. What we really want to see is the dawning of the Age of Joker, as the mantra Life Is A Joke infects everything, even the most innocent thing, until we realise Joker is an inevitable outgrowth of the jokers who run this system.The sound is very good, with a constant hubbub of tinny TVs, the guy in the apartment upstairs shouting, ""Shut up!"", and the din of Gotham's chaotic streets. Also, the music keeps reminding you of Sinatra's genius for hitting unexpected notes that are just right. Most interesting part of the cinematography is the giant architecture.Overall: Interesting, not awesome.ps. The best line is a clever gag nicked from Bob Monkhouse: ""When I was growing up I told them I wanted to become a comedian. They laughed at me then ....""","

In an odd way, he reminded me of Sean Penn in that when you watch him, you forget he is an actor, all you see is the character. In reality, the rest of the cast were merely props in this one-man show... even Robert De Niro.There are a lot of Easter Eggs as nods to other films of the late 70s and early 80s, which was cool.As an origin story in the comic book universe, Joker was good, better than most. I do not judge movies based on how closely they follow a book or if they follow the rules of physics, but more if they entertain me and allow me to escape my reality for a few hours. In that sense, Joker left me wanting for more. Yeah, there are political nods that you can read into this, but they weren't forced onto the viewer, more of a backdrop.The randomness of Joker's thinking and thoughts was in a word, distracting. Because the director put me in the lead character's psychosis, I had a hard time sympathizing with any character in the movie, which makes it difficult to connect to the story.Maybe the real genius of the movie was that randomness, seeing the world through the psychotic mind of the Joker. But it didn't make for a hugely entertaining experience for me.","

"Joker","grantss","4 October 2019","Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say ""Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman"", rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though.","

"Joker","MisterJxroen","24 December 2019","When I first saw the 'Joker' in ""The Dark Knight"" I fell in love with the character, because of his somewhat correct motives and the way he thinks. I had never seen a character like him before in any movie, which made it so new and refreshing to watch. When the ""Joker"" movie was announced I was stunned. Especially when I noticed Joaquin Phoenix was going to take on the role of the Joker. An actor that in my opinion is one of the greatest - if not the best - performers of the 20th century. Sr. Phoenix is so good at taking on roles that most people wouldn't want to take on because of how horrifying, haunting or psychologically difficult they are. As someone who absolutely loved Heath Ledger (may he rest in peace) as the Joker, I was extremely curious about Joaquin's performance when I was waiting in the theater for the movie the start.I was not disappointed, not at all. Sr. Phoenix performed beyond my expectations. To me it felt like Joaquin actually transformed 'himself' into the character which gave the personage a very realistic and terrifying touch. The story allowed this character to feel even more real, by placing him in a world that could - if not already - be real and making him face obstacles that people might actually be facing daily. As if there is a deeper message and meaning behind the story. It is very difficult to describe my thoughts on this movie, but that's what so great about it. It allows you to think for yourself.At the end of the movie, every single person in the theater probably thought of a different ending or reason for certain key points in the film. It wasn't just a casual ""good guy bad guy"" story, not at all. I enjoyed it a lot, I will enjoy it many more times and I highly recommend you to give it a shot as well if you haven't yet - because it might just change your whole perspective on cinematography and the story (or one of many) of the Joker.","

"Joker","xvubojypasyhwurhxkedivvr","27 October 2019","I was seriously not interested in that movie after watching some clowns roaming about in the trailer - I'm getting tired of the redundant Purge movies' characters, you know ; and I'm not enjoying the new trend of blurring the lines between good and evil (e.g. Maleficent, 2019). I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when some friends opted for watching it, and I was baffled!The movie was nothing I had expected it to be. It is actually what a Joker backstory should be like. It is believable, intriguing and down to earth. It is really what you can call an adaptation. Todd Phillips manages to make you feel the darkness in Gotham and how it roves through the city in search of the next victim. The whole Batman universe is thus successfully explained. And Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in the role of the Joker.This movie is not really for the usual Batman fan in search of fantasy, fight scenes and high-tech accessories, but for the pragmatic moviegoers who can enjoy watching a masterpiece just like others enjoy French cuisine in a 5-starred restaurant - I'm not kidding! Great job!","

"Joker","ElMaruecan82","14 October 2019","Todd Philips' ""Joker"" has spread so many comments and controversy that I don't know exactly where to stand. The film reminded critics of Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and while Joaquin Phoenix' performance channeled the inner angst and alienation that drove the driver Bickle to an extreme -and bloody- corner, I found so many other sources of inspiration that if anything, ""Joker"" is the best tribute to the New Hollywood period.I found ""Network"" in the film, ""Death Wish"", references to ""The King of Comedy"", Marty's underrated movie about a man who wished to exist through the only talent he felt being endowed with... and naturally, there's something of ""A Clockwork Orange"" in the obscene stylishness the Joker embraces his new persona with. In a way, that the film met with controversy is logical, you can't make a social comment about violence and its dangerous appeal by sugarcoating it, violence like its enemies, use symbols and slogan, in fact, revolt is a mask that violence uses to operate undercover or is it the opposite? ""Joker"" is the slap today's audiences needed and that it used the Joker mask in our superhero era makes it even more relevant and accessible. But truth be said, any controversy the film should stir mustn't distract from the real deal.Indeed, any viewer familiar with one tenth of Phoenix' filmography knows the actor's ability to portray enigmatic and troubled characters with a dark side barely hidden, but even with that in mind it's impossible not to be blown away by his performance and compelled by his suffering. He shouldn't be the dark horse of the awards season but the frontrunner because his performance is so rich, so powerful, so intense and so bizarre and grotesque in a captivating way that it's almost like watching a movie within a movie, as if his distortable face was the operation theatre to his acting force, as if his nervous smile slowly turning into cries made a true symphony of pathos and anger. That actor is a treasure to Hollywood and here he's given the kind of rangy performances that can't do without earning awards. His snubbing would be controversy material if you asked me.Now, to the film. The first act immerses us in the life of Arthur Fleck, a clown and wannabe stand-up comedian. At first, I was afraid that the manic laughter scenes would be too redundant and turn themselves to cheap gimmicks, to remind us that we're dealing with the Joker, but no, Phoenix plays his Arthur as a man who's not a bad person. Raised by an over-protective and sickly mother, brutalized by kids who sees in a clown a living sign saying ""kick me"", humiliated by people who can't understand his medical condition, the point isn't to portray Joker as a martyr but a product of a specific environment and education, or lack thereof. Like anyone, he's got dreams, projects, but he's entrapped in a condition that makes it impossible to communicate or connect with the others except through hallucinations and would-happen moments, he's a misfit with a fragile condition that keeps worsening until it offers a platform for his dark psyche to perform.Does the film excuse him? No. Does it justify his actions? Hell, no. It just clarifies the need to perform that way. There's a point of no return reached in that psychological journey, when one humiliation too many triggers a strong desire to express itself through a sort of showmanship, something relevant in our days where people seek any ways to reach posterity. Set in what seems to be the early 80s, it puts Arthur in the same urban alienation context than Travis Bickle but with a passion shared with Rupert Pumpkin's and a ""mad-as-hell"" prophetic rage with Howard Beale's role. Near the end, there's a shot that follows one of the film's most shocking moment and it's an obvious nod to the anticlimactic finale of Lumet's masterpiece.But I can't insist too much on how good Phoenix his, one could see a few impersonations of Malcolm McDowell's dance when he ""punished"" his fellow droogs or get vibes from the two only performances that earned a posthumous Oscar, Peter Finch and Heath Ledger, still, there's something unique in that tormented role he inhabits with such a soul dedication that it makes Nicholon's Joker worse than the cartoon counterpart. ,""Joker"" isn't dangerous but brave enough to question violence in the way it seems like the only plausible answer, it might titillate a few demagogue instincts but that's an unfair trial in the light of the recent events all over the world and that preceded the film. I walk often at night and see homeless people living in impoverished conditions, drowning their sorrows in alcohol and losing their manners once there's nothing to lose... and perhaps that's leaders' responsibility, praising democratic values while its application contradicts its own ideal. Anything is allowed when nothing is possible, is perhaps the biggest joke of all, and that it goes all downhill when the social budget is cut is perhaps the film's boldest stance against the shift between leaders and people.And that it used Bruce's father Thomas Wayne to connect the final act with a canon we're all familiar with is one of the many narrative delights of that character study and psychological thriller à la ""Woman Under the Influence"" where suspense doesn't come from a bomb but a ticking bomb of a soul. If De Niro's presence ties the plot with its chief inspirations, the film belongs to Joaquin Phoenix who gave a performance for ages, and a character who's relevant in the way he pits democratic ideals against urban reality. And my wish is to see another connection with De Niro with Phoenix winning an Oscar, it would be the second time for a character who already won one after De Niro with ""The Godfather Part II"".As for the glorifying violence trial... we've been there already.","

"Joker","blanbrn","4 October 2019","Many of us over the years have been attached and thrilled with the ""Clown Prince of Crime"" as D.C. comic fans know as the one and only ""Joker"". And we've seen different takes and spins from Romero's camp, to Ledger's dark wild crazy turn, and the man the one and only Jack played the clown with vanity and brought a proper turn to a bad guy while having fun(Nicholson's ""Joker"" was like that of the late 70's early 80's ""Joker"" in D.C. comics) now enter Phoenix who's much different with a creepy origin story.Set in the early 1980's Gotham city is gritty, raw and the social and political climate is in the gutter as just getting by is so tough. And just tip toeing and dancing his way thru the drama is Arthur Fleck(in a hell of a turn from Joaquin at least nominate him for a ""Golden Globe"" or ""Oscar"") a lonely and depressed mommies boy who's a skinny starving clown who just can't fit in he's a society misfit. It's really somewhat of a sad character study.However hope is possible in the form of Fleck wanting to get away from being a clown for children as his real dream is to be a standup comedian as his smile and crazy lasting laugh is always present! As laughter is the cure for his pain! His hope of escape is to appear on a late night talk show hosted by Murray Franklin(Robert De Niro) where Arthur hopes to showcase his talents. Also the only other wild card pleasure he has in his life is dating a single mom named Sophie(Zazie Beetz) from his apartment building. And his sick mother Penny keeps Arthur hanging on with love and hope as that keeps him hanging on.Only secrets and ghost of the past and painful memories only destroy the fragile mind of Arthur even more as a connection to millionaire Thomas Wayne is revealed and even more shattering is how this connection and more events will lead to ""The Dark Knight"". Great and excellent work from director Todd Phillips who despite making a stand alone dark character study still connects things up with others in the D.C. universe.Many might see this picture as a dark tragedy I think it's a take and spin on how one is affected by life and then they take on a different role after years of being abused and mistreated in the world by it's people. Still this film is excellent because it's unique and finally glad a stand alone movie celebrates ""The Joker""(the greatest comic book bad guy ever!) As Joaquin's performance was raw, gritty, and a lashing out of some payback to society. Wow enough said best D.C. comics character study ever made!","

"Joker","Thecritichood234","23 December 2023","In my humble opinion, this is probably the top 10, book movie of all time in the top three DC movies of all time because This is what The DCEU needed. More character driven stories to be honest, more elsewhere or not a movie that's connected with the main universe type movie because this right here to me is a masterpiece. This is definitely a different interpretation of the Joker because if you look back, this was supposed to be Jared Leto's joker having a standalone film, but that did not work because first the carrier did not have any compelling things that he can do on his own plus DC was trying to catch up with the MCU Since the NCU was popular made a lot of money and people wouldn't stop talking about it but on this movie, this felt like a DC movie plus very inspired by Martin Scorseses King of comedy and taxi driver, but featuring the joker the reason that this my top 10 comic book movies of all time and possibly top three or top two DC movies of all time is because it's character driven and make a sympathize on the insanity and the crazy personality of the Joker because this is a good evil movie meaning that this is another protagonist movie which I like movie We are placed in a point of view of how Gotham is tearing apart itself, and how Gotham is tearing apart our own characters, and the core reason why this movie works for me because the stuff that he doing we should not be on his side throughout this whole movie he's killing he's murdering His own ""parent"" He's killing without remorse, but we don't turn on him. We still are on his side because the people around him are making him be this way. The people around him is making him have the right to kill them because Treat him badly and how It represents Gotham on a daily basis, and that right there is something DC needs to learn to understand their characters. And the performance by Phoenix isn't no heath ledger, but it's up there with the best performances in comic book history overall, this movie is what dc is all about, and the dark Knight, and the Batman, where is not trying to be like like other comic movies, or like the MCU, it is its own thing, more darker, more gritty, more deeper characters, and more deeper movies 10/10.","

"Joker","mickgmovies","5 October 2019","A lot has already been said about this film since it's release. It's a movie that will be hated by those who blindly overdose on the instant gratification and throw-away feel-good marvelesque movies, and loved by Dark Knighters who crave for brooding character development.It's not an easy film to watch. But it is captivating in a similarly slow-burn visually sumptuous way of past films it gives homage to: Taxi Driver, Kings of Comedy, Dog Day Afternoon and more. And similar to these movies, at it's heart is a central character whose slow slide down the ladder of society results in a series of pressure-valve-release gratuitous actions (towards the end).Whilst the movie misses a beat in using the stellar supporting cast to best effect, what it does do is act as a prequel to Batman that shows there's always two side's to every story. The Joker isn't born bad. And he doesn't knowingly derail young Bruce Waynes life. But ultimately he does find 'himself' in the events that unfold around his actions, and which snowballs through the media.It's here that a lot of the commentary on social extremism has been pointed, and with some justification. But what it really shows is that we all want to be treated as human beings. To be seen. To be heard. To be cared for. To be respected. To be loved. And to belong.Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker to find these things - that were missing in his life.It's here that it hits close to home, as so many of the events unfolding in our lives today are a result of similar sense of alienation and frustration with society letting people down. From a lack of compassion, care and respect for each other.","

"Joker","sneakyshooter","11 January 2020","Like this movie or not, you have to agree its at least a breath of fresh air. Phoenix does a great job at channeling just the right amount of psycho to portray the Joker.The cinematography and lighting is very well done and really sets the atmosphere. While I agree with some that the morales of the movie can be misconstrued, it seems to be about coming out of your shell to be your true self and not caring what others think.I did feel at times the movie was a bit preachy though. The whole ""we live in a society..."" comes off rather strong towards the end. Society and rich people = bad!! That was a bit too on the nose.I also never really got the notion that this Joker was clever or intelligent in this movie. He just seemed psychotic. Which is really only a small part of what makes the character scary.Now, I get that its from the Jokers point of view, but the Waynes and almost ALL other characters are just shown to be total one dimensional a-holes that we dont really have sympathy for. This could have been handled better I believe.BUT, what makes these bad things listed above so interesting, is the very real possibility that the events in the film were actually all in the Jokers mind. Its established early on that he has delusions often, so the entire revolution and his rise to hero status could have very well been all imagined, which makes a lot of sense.In conclusion though, I appreciated the risks the movie took and performance given by Phoenix. It was a fresh take on an already well established character, which can be difficult to do. And considering all of the god awful movies released now a days, I cant blame people who praise it as a perfect 10. Its deff worth it to give it a watch for yourself.","

Such a small, yet beautiful detail to addFor the people who didn't like Joker because it made them 'too uncomfortable' it means that Todd Phillips has done his job right, this film is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable, sick, on the edge of your seat, etcin conclusion: This film is perfect in every aspect, the cinematography, the lighting, the small details like the trash bags alongside Arthur when he walks on the street, showing how disgusting Gotham is, and making that symbolic to how society treats Arthur; those small, yet beautiful details really make this film beautiful.

"Joker","louwburger-42312","6 January 2020","Prepare to be devastated by Joker. Not so much by the intense madness and blood-spewing violence that is sometimes hard to watch, or the overwhelming central performance by Joaquin Phoenix in the title role, but by the vision and artistry of the film itself. Even if you hate it, it's unlike anything you've ever seen before-like waking up next to a poisonous snake nestled on your blanket, poised and ready to strike. You're horrified but unable to move. Regardless of my mixed feelings, I think it's the best film about the psychological effect of violence as pop art since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.Vigorously directed by Todd Phillips, who also co-wrote the unique if uneven screenplay with Scott Silver, and beautifully shot by Lawrence Sher, Joker traces the history of the popular DC Comics villain and Batman's arch enemy in totally original terms. After award-winning performances by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the role, you may think you know the Joker, but who is he and where did he come from?",NA
"Joker","dragokin","22 November 2021","To paraphrase Joker: We got what we deserved.Imagine a world in which the same artistic effort invested in bringing Joker to screen has been used to produce the movies based on Marvel and DC characters in the past two to three decades. Clearly such a scenario isn't suitable for this Earth, rather for a parallel universe, a topic thoroughly explored by both studios.Jokes apart (no pun intended), Joker arguably surpassed any movie based on a comic book character. Christopher Nolan with his Batman trilogy got halfway there and Superman Begins (2006), Kenneth Branaghs Thor (2011), as well as Hulk (2003) with Eric Bana, all get merely an honorable mention. To be honest, DC always cared more about the content, while Marvel worried about ""the fun factor"" which eventually led us to this movie.When you strip down the hype surrounding Joker we're left with a decent drama. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a fine performance, although it is based on several of his previous roles, with obvious comparisons being The Master (2012) and Two Lovers (2008), although his bare back features here, similar as in Quills (2000).On the side note, Robert De Niro decided to act after years, if not decades, of mailing in his performance for the camera.

"Joker","HairyMart1","5 October 2019","At the heart of this film is an outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix. And it is that performance itself that I think distracts from a number of the films shortcomings. Aiming for a gritty down-at-heel look from the opening moments, with the recreation of the Warner Brothers logo from the 1970s, you very much get the mood of classics such as the French Connection and Taxi Driver. Films with no real good guy and a very dower and world weary feel. Within this setting we find struggling clown Arthur Fleck, a man suffering from numerous mental health issues who has been overlooked by the support services, and which are in turn themselves been cutback by the city, and ever demanding budget savings. As the film moves on Arthur becomes more downtrodden and isolated, his connection with reality more and more tenuous, until ... well that's the point of the film - the origin of The Joker. But getting here is not a startling revelation, just an all to believable of another troubled person falling through the cracks of the support services, in a city that doesn't care. Which is an issue that needs addressing and is handled so much better in Phoenix's previous film ""You were never really here"". Maybe the point of the filmmakers were to make it a very grounded take, but I feel that in turn misses the concept of the Joker. Remove the face-paint, cut away the pointless Wayne references and you have a much better film. With it and you have yet another actor undertaking a great physical performance but not much else.",NA

The best part of the film is that it is not dumbed down to suit the fanboys, it is done in a mature and art-house way to influence and inspire the audience. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar level performance that is one for the ages. Also love the uncertainty of every scene, the constant questioning of what is real and what is not. The eccentricity of the character does not feel forced, it conjures a sort of sympathy from the audience throughout the film. Every scene, every movement and every dialogue felt sinister in a poetic way.Not sure if the DC Universe can follow suit after this, but I think they should leave this as an independent work. Felt the last scene with Thomas Wayne is somewhat unnecessary and broke the mood a little.",NA
