"The Equalizer 3","FeastMode","2 September 2023","The Equalizer 3 is a solid concluding chapter to this entertaining trilogy. Even with an entirely new setting and cast, it does a great job of setting everything up and making you care about his new relationships. The movie overall is entertaining and mostly satisfying.As usual, Denzel is a beast. Charm and charisma are off the charts, this isn't news. Like with part 2, there are few looks he gives that chill me to the bone. It's so impressive the way he portrays being the nicest guy in one scene and the scariest guy in another.The only thing holding this back from being great is the surprising lack of action. Now I wouldn't call either of the previous movies action-packed. But I would estimate this one has a total of about 7 minutes of action. That's just not enough. And it especially hurts during the not-so-climactic climax.I still had a good time with this movie. If you like the series, I think you will be pleased. And to Hollywood: more Denzel please!

"The Equalizer 3","RightOnDaddio","3 September 2023","This is a decent and satisfying end to a trilogy. Remember the good ol' days, back in the day, when movies stopped at 3? No Fast X, Saw X, Indiana Jones cracking a whip at 85.Things feel more complete at three.The way things should be.A beginning, a middle and an end.And not some old man doing ridiculous things way beyond his age or physical capability.Denzel is one of the greats.And he deserves credit for never taking a role too far.He's as much a presence on the screen here as he ever has been.His age and wisdom is his real strength.Oh, there will be punches thrown. Bones broken and many cries of agony.But at least it comes from the villains on screen and not those in the audience.Coastal Italy is gorgeous.Denzel is a living legend.You've seen the other two films in this series.Wrap it up nicely with this installment.Ciao.","

"The Equalizer 3","Sleepin_Dragon","26 September 2023","My expectations for this one were moderate, I enjoyed the first, I wasn't blown away by the second, this third and final movie is actually really good.It's a pretty good storyline, with Robert of course central to events and fighting for justice. He takes on Italian gang bosses, and of course there are multiple fight and action sequences, but in this film, he felt mortal, in the second I felt they made him into some sort of superhero, you felt he was indestructible, I didn't get that here.The action sequences are great, and it is very, very well produced, but the true winner here is The Italian scenery, it looks sublime, and arguably enhances the movie.Washington, outstanding once again, he really does nail it. This film has prompted me to get a hold of the original Edward Woodward series, that's up next.Entertaining.7/10.","

"The Equalizer 3","masonsaul","30 August 2023","The Equalizer 3 rounds out this unexpected trilogy with another satisfying action thriller that continues the journey of a man who understands violence, trying to finally put that behind him, placing him out of his element to show quite literally how far he goes for people. The ending hinders it a little because it feels anticlimactic but it still works.On a quest to finally find and maintain happiness, Denzel Washington is as flawless as ever. This time around he gets to be happy and show McCall actually enjoying life for once and as this is the final instalment there's obviously some introspection and self reflection as well.The villains are really weak, it's not a massive distraction as they remain easy to hate and don't take up too much time but as the marketing implied that this would be McCall meeting his equal is kinda laughable considering how little they feel like a genuine threat to him.The subplot involving Dakota Fanning initially threatens to derail the film but thankfully it ties back into the main narrative effectively and any scene she shares with Washington is great because it's both a Man on Fire reunion and her rapport with Washington is so good.Antione Fuqua's direction impresses yet again, the violence has never been faster or more brutal and the stark colour palette allows this one to stand out in contrast to its predecessors. The music by Marcelo Zarvos is better than it's ever been, so distinct and noticeably industrial.","

"The Equalizer 3","neil-476","3 September 2023","Robert McCall, seriously wounded during operational activity, recuperates in the incredibly picturesque costal Italian town of Altamonte, a place where comes to feel he may find peace of mind. Two things happen while he is mending: he sends some intel he discovered during the op anonymously to his old organisation, and he realises that a group of mafia lowlifes are making things bad for local residents. These two threads intertwine.Denzel Washington's 3rd outing as McCall takes us to more exotic locations, gives another nasty slow build but, fear not, we get a fair amount of action norwithstanding our protagonist being out of commission for much of the action.I really like McCall. There is something very satisfying in seeing an enormously sympathetic and likeable character who is capable of turning on a sixpence, and doing what they do to violent, repellent people, only doing it better. And with a cold, matter-of-fact lack of emotion.There were a lot of moments I lked here, chief among them a shockingly well realised explosion, and an ending setting up McCall, recent victim of a severe woung, outnumbered against a powerful, well armed and organised foe. And a brief callback to the two previous films caught me by surprise.","

"The Equalizer 3","michvanbeek","4 September 2023","In 2014, director Antoine Fuqua released The Equalizer, a film based on the television series of the same name that aired from 1985 to 1989. Where actor Edward Woodward played the role of Robert McCall in the series, none other than Denzel Washington was chosen for this film, who of course already had a whole arsenal of this kind of action films to his name in the past. What is funny is that in this third part of The Equalizer he is reunited with Dakota Fanning. The two already starred together in the 2004 film Man on Fire, but Fanning was only a ten-year-old girl there. In this film, she plays a CIA agent who tracks down McCall after an anonymous phone call to her agency leads her to a very large drug discovery on a wine farm. After a very strong first part, a fairly mediocre second part of The Equalizer followed in 2018. Now, five years later, you hold your breath a bit whether this third part is going to be worth it, of course. Well, that sounds quite negative compared to the second part, but it was just where the first part excelled, the second part had simply become more of a standard action print. Certainly not a bad film, but just less than its predecessor.In this film, the story moves to Italy, Sicily to be precise. McCall ends up badly injured in Sicily, where he is rescued by the local agent Gio Bonucci, who takes him to the local doctor Enzo Arisio. McCall comes to and befriends the locals. The village is only ravaged by the mafia and of course McCall won't let that happen just like that. The film takes a long time to explain everything. It all starts on the wine farm, where McCall is on the trail of serious criminals and also murders them. The action scenes leave little to the imagination and are sometimes just rancidly portrayed. After that, the film slows down considerably and takes a good look at McCall's recovery and how he befriends the local population. When he leaves an anonymous tip to CIA agent Emma Collins, it is of course a simple calculation that she will quickly track McCall. Meanwhile, McCall watches with sorrow how the local population is put under heavy pressure by the mafia. Of course you immediately understand that they shouldn't have messed with McCall.Most of the film seems like a long advertising film for Italy and it may evoke the holiday feeling in many viewers. The images are absolutely beautiful and eye-catching, something that enhances the atmosphere of the film. Still, a point of criticism can be made with the bad guys from the story, because we can't really say that they really express a lot of threat so that McCall faces a real challenge. But also the character of CIA agent Emma Collins has no added value in the film. You will therefore often wonder why she has so much screen time in the film. Not that it's really annoying or anything, but it doesn't really add value. Perhaps because this is the only film of the three that is under two hours, this storyline may have been intended as filler to keep the film from being too short. It now feels a bit like a wander in the story where the writers didn't really know where they wanted to go. The ending is what you can really expect from it and is of course accompanied by a lot of violence, but this so-called final chapter does not become as good as the first part.The Equalizer 3 may not be as good as the very strong first part, but it certainly beats the disappointing second part in every way. Denzel Washington returns for the third and, according to the subtitle, the last time as the ice-cold and tough retired commando who carried out so-called 'black operations' for the government. This time the story moves to the beautiful Sicily in Italy, where Robert McCall gets into trouble with the mafia this time. The role of Dakota Fanning is very superfluous and really adds nothing to the film at all, the mafia members don't really radiate a lot of threat, so as a viewer you know that McCall will not be faced with his toughest job. Still, the action is nice in the film and it also has a pleasant running time that has been kept under two hours. Whether this really will be the final piece in the Equalizer series is of course still the question, but it is clear that this is very pleasant viewing and simply an excellent action film.","

"The Equalizer 3","george.schmidt","3 September 2023","THE EQUALIZER (2023) *** Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Eugenio Mastrandrea, David Denman, Gaia Scodellaro, Remo Girone, Andrea Scarduzio, Andrea Dodero. The final chapter in the trilogy of the adaptation of the '80s tv series with Washington's Robert McCall attempting retirement in a Sicilian sleepy village where he finds the locals under the threat of the drug cartel led by Scarduzio which leads to a personal vendetta with copious bloodshed and retribution. Nice to see the MAN ON FIRE reunion of Washington and Fanning as a fed helping to snub out the gangsters. Washington is in fine form as the stil-waters-run-deep assassin whose dexterity never continues to surprise nor its ingenious gory outcomes. A fitting last dance (for now) directed with brio by Antoine Fuqua who helmed the series with aplomb.","

"The Equalizer 3","filmtravel101","13 September 2023","This is by far the worst script of the trilogy.The story is 80% denzel on holiday in Amalfi coastal village where he sips tea, watches locals and dines out all day. And then at the end kills a few bad guys - but at some point in 3rd act he offers himself up but bad mafia guys decide not to end his life in front of the village people and end this miserable excuse of a movie. You almost wish they shot him to make it a tiny bit realistic and challenging.Oh and during his holiday which makes no sense at all and drags on like a slow Condé Nast tourist trip - it finally explains its lame story started because of some pensioner got hacked so he flew to recup 360k in cash and admits he does not even know the guy - huh?? Which feels more hollow than the shallow story - but let's not digress because the big reveal moment is the thinly written part of Dakota Fanning who asks did you pick me- duh - because she is daughter of his old boss. Really?This could have been revealed in 2nd act and made for a great story plot instead of 2 dimensional thin character that just acts like a teenager on holiday and definitely not CIA material - bad casting as Dakota best part is getting almost blown up. Good riddance but she survives.The entire film feels like a bad Charles Bronson movie from 70s and even the bad guys are pathetic characterization of the Italian Camora aka mafia.No idea how this film got such high ratings but by far the worst of the series and Denzel must have a Villa in Amalfi coast or family wanted a sweet holiday. Go in with super low expectations and you might enjoy the Italian scenery because there is not much equalizing - but loads of social dining. Maybe next film will include a Greek wedding4 stars to the food,fish, and tea - and Amalfi villages.","

"The Equalizer 3","martinrobertson300482","14 September 2023","I liked Equalizer 1 and 2 but this third entry has a ""might as well make another one"" feel about it. There are some brutal kills but some of them feel very phoney with their CGI blood.The plot is very straight forward and kind of predictable. The mafia villians are pretty dumb. While the random scenes featuring a grown up Dakota Fanning feel tacked on and unnecessary.The other 2 movies built up to a big action finale. Which made for some standout action. The first one in a hardware store, and the second during a hurricane. But this one is just in some guys house.Its unfortunately very straight forward and fotgetable this time, but Denzel Washington has a few bad ass moments. If you want to wait past all the scenes of him tackling high stairs.","

"The Equalizer 3","Tweetienator","13 September 2023","There is a strong similarity between The Equalizer and the John Wick series (and the Taken movies too): with every entry the quality and entertainment level goes weaker and weaker. The first Equalizer movie was strong, the second not so strong and the third one is, well, acceptable, but nowhere near the quality of the first one. Anyway, if you love to watch Denzel Washington and just want some explosions and bum bum, you still can put this one on your to watch list. Production is solid, Denzel cool as ever, that's about it. My rate for the first one is 8, the second got a 6, this one gets a 5 but no more.","

"The Equalizer 3","TheDanishMovie-Nerd","4 September 2023","Following the disappointingly lackluster sequel that notably marked the first time Denzel ever agreed to a sequel, ""The Equalizer 3"" remarkably surpasses expectations - though admittedly, I had set the bar fairly low. But any reservations were dispelled early on, as the movie plunged straight into its visceral, stylish action that sees Denzel masterfully blending the vibes of John Wick, Liam Neeson's unyielding avenger in ""Taken"", and his own enigmatic survivor from ""The Book of Eli"".Age seems like just a number when it comes to Denzel. As he inches closer to 70, there's no slowing down. The film cleverly incorporates his age into his character, offering action sequences that lean more on intelligent combat rather than sheer brute strength and stamina akin to Rocky or John Wick. There's an elegance in how he maneuvers, outthinking and outmaneuvering adversaries in ways that leave you awestruck.I absolutely loved witnessing the reunion of Denzel and Dakota Fanning, their electric dynamic echoing reminiscently of ""Man On Fire"". Their chemistry is undeniably magnetic, and adds layers of depth to the already charged narrative.One of the movie's masterstrokes is its unyielding focus on the sheer prowess of Denzel's character. He remains ever the cool, unshakeable force of nature, perpetually ten steps ahead of everyone, leaving both foes and audience in anticipation of his next move.While some might dismiss it as yet another action-filled extravaganza, for me, ""The Equalizer 3"" was the epitome of action cinema artistry. A mixture of raw, over-the-top action, the evergreen charm of Denzel, and a touch of Italian style made it the ultimate cinematic cocktail. It's a whirlwind of entertainment, action, and thrill - and I found myself completely immersed and gratified.In short, ""The Equalizer 3"" delivers in spades. For fans of Denzel and the action genre, it's a treat that shouldn't be missed.","

"The Equalizer 3","vengeance20","1 September 2023","Was forever searching up Equalizer 3 on Google sine the 2nd film & it was always just plain speculation. It was only until early this year though, that we would be getting a 3rd & until I discovered recently, a final entry in the Equalizer Franchise. I was hoping this would be good, but sadly it didn't quite hit the mark.The film sees Robert McCall who finds himself at home in Southern Italy, but, he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia.I found the film to be pretty weak. For starters, there's literally no action & any of that action that we see here, is way too few & far between. The story makes no sense whatsoever & it didn't help that a lot of the dialogue was foreign & subtitled as if the plot was hard enough to grasp as it was.Our main man just plods along after a killer opening for nearly a good hour & I found myself feeling frustrated with the fact that he wasn't doing what he did best. I mean, they could've easily had him go about his day-today life in Sicily & had him kicking arse & taking care of business, but no. We get a weak & flat film that drags along & along for 60% of the film. Disappointing.The action was good & the ending wasn't bad despite being weak in itself. I mean, just letting the main bad guy fumble about like a drunken lout throthing like a rabid rot wiler dog? No badarse fighting duel? Like I said, the gore was there & the action really deliver, but it was too few & far between.The film drags after the opening & if it's bad enough we don't get to see McCall doing what he does best, nothing remotely interetsing happens between the opening & the 3rd act. It's frustrating as given the first 2 films delivering like they did. I mean, did it not occur to the makers here that the film dragged on for a good hour with no action?This film seriously reminds me of Halloween Ends so much, a disappointing end to a promising trilogy. And to add insult to injury, this is the last one in the Franchise. What a way to send off the character for crying out loud...Despite the actors doing a good enough of a job in the 102 minute (1hr & 42min) film, it really lacked for me. The villains weren't even that interesting, not to mention their motivations.Overall, it's a disappointing & weak entry & final to the trilogy. From the lack of action, to the incoherent story to the dragged out feel to the ironically shortest film of the trilogy. This film really didn't cut the mustard & this is despite the gruesome action we got (what little of it) & characters who weren't all the interesting apart from the man himself ironically enough doing little to fa for 60% of the film. What a way to end the franchise. This is definitely the weakest one. Go watch it, but you'll be frustrated after the opening trust me.5/10.","

"The Equalizer 3","Xavier_Stone","17 September 2023","What a joke of a movie. The into was great with a 5 min action scene, and then that's it for about half of the movie. He limps around in an Italian village and heals and develops into a drama/romance.Perhaps Denzel is aging and can't keep up with all the Tom Cruise action movies, or perhaps he's tired and wanted to do other than shooting all the time. Fine. Just don't name this part of the Equalizer series as it's not really in the same ballpark.Perhaps he's using Equal, the sugar substitute in his tea and that's the inside joke.Dakota Fanning as a CIA agent investigating drugs and cartels? Totally miscast and poorly. She still looks 13 even wearing some grown up jeans spouting a few intelligent lines.The story itself is sub par. We wait and wait for any type of action, and then we get to the boss fight.. and he goes home to eat pasta. Laughing out loud at the writer.Then some poor action in the finale after the pasta, when everyone is tired from the carb loading. Incredibly poor. 7 and 8 star reviews are just insane.","

"The Equalizer 3","nicolasroop","3 September 2023","It's not very often you see a second sequel in a film franchise and it actually turns out to be a very good movie. In fact, most of the time, they end up being some of the worst. Thankfully, this new entry by series director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington is a fantastic example of how to do a sequel right.I will say the film is not perfect. There are a few storylines that don't quite add up to anything, like Denzel's character having flashbacks of his murders and how bereft and awful it makes him feel. Something thay could have and maybe should have been explored just a bit more. However, that is ok because the film swiftly picks itself up and in the days where most films like this are over 2 hours long, this one keeps it's pace and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Good choice on the writers and directors part.The acting throughout the film ranged from good to fantastic. It seemed everyone was pretty much on point here as far as what their characters needed and how to display that to the audience. It was also lovely to see Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington back together. I would love to see them work together in other films because they have fantastic on-screen chemistry.Overall, one of the best sequels to a film I've seen in a long time. Although, not an entirely necessary one, but the story and acting is good enough to justify it's existence. Plus, can you really go wrong with Denzel?4 italian mobsters out of 5.","

"The Equalizer 3","bastille-852-731547","31 August 2023","Denzel Washington is undoubtedly one of the best actors of his generation, and he has starred in a wide range of roles including more prestige-oriented films as well as some mid-range action thrillers. This franchise, about a vigilante who will stop at nothing to deliver violent justice on behalf of those who have been wronged. The first two films were moderately entertaining action films largely anchored by Washington's charisma, but this film is a significant step down from the first two in terms of quality. It's even more generic, pointless, and lacking in creativity or soul, which is too bad given just how much I am a fan of Denzel.This film centers around Robert McCall living in southern Italy, having a seemingly idyllic life until that is derailed by Mafia gangsters. The first two films in this series were far from original, but they felt more unique in story than this film, which is completely by-the-numbers. There's never any real tension about the fate of neither McCall nor the vicious gangsters he's trying to stop. The screenplay is also generic and rote; moreso than in the earlier films. There's just so little to take away from the storytelling here besides sporadic, outlandish bursts of R-rated action. McCall's character isn't much further developed, the plot developments aren't unique or clever, and despite being less than two hours, the film feels a bit long. The only unequivocal positive is some beautiful shots of southern Italy.As a result, I do not recommend this film. This doesn't make Denzel Washington any less of an excellent actor, he just simply needs better material than this, as the overwhelming majority of his films are. 4/10.","

"The Equalizer 3","wittmann73","9 September 2023","I am a huge fan of the first part, the second one was decent, but this one was a huge disappointment. Hard to believe the same star and director were involved in this. The main problem is that this third installment is incredibly slow and lacks action, esp. When compared to the first Equalizer movie.That 80% of the film was in Italian with subtitles did not help.There are only three very short action scenes in this, one at the beginning, one in the middle and one at the end. Nothing about them is exciting or special. Most of the time you see Denzel sitting at a table drinking tea or walking around a nice Italian city. The villains are totally generic and forgettable. The sub-plot with a young female CIA agent is unnecessary.What left me thinking was why was everyone in this Italian city so nice towards Denzel´s character, although they did not know him at all? Why did the doctor help him and did not report him? Why did the policeman help him, why did he not search his car or did any background check?The idea of McCall going against the Italian mafia sounded so cool and promising, but the outcome was disappointing. Maybe Fuqua and Denzel just wanted to have a nice holiday in Italy.","

"The Equalizer 3","alfredvankuik","5 September 2023","It's been a while since I watched the first two Equalizers, but I remember them quite fondly as fun movies that found a nice balance between a simple yet effective story and brutal, well-made action scenes. So when I discovered that a third installmant was arriving soon, I was excited.Today, that excitement was shattered upon actually seeing the movie. The Equalizer 3 stars Denzel Washington, of course. And he is once again brilliant. The story here is that Denzel runs into an international drug trafficking ring by accident while trying to steal back his Uber driver's pension fund. The opening is amazing, showing off beautiful cinematography and a creative action sequence in true Equalizer style. Enjoy it while it lasts, because that's the last you'll see of that.After killing off a few mobsters, Denzel passes out by the side of the road and gets picked up by a random guy who just happens to be the son of a doctor who in turn just happens to like caring for random people with bullet wounds. Of course he is also called Enzo and he is an almost offensively stereotypical Italian. For the next hour or so, prepare to watch Denzel Washington drink tea. This movie contains more shots of Denzel drinking tea than it does of him firing a gun. In this little Italian town everyone loves Denzel for no apparent reason, to the point where random kids and grandmas walk up to him and give him gifts without even knowing him. There's a woman who basically throws herself at Washington from the second she sees him. Within a week, the people call him ""one of them"" and will literally die for him. It's just because he's American it seems, because he doesn't do much else. He watches the mafia terrorize the town and the people he apparently loves so much, but he doesn't actually get involved for weeks, not even when his favorite shop is burned to the ground.Meanwhile, there's a hesitant subplot where a CIA agent is investigating the drug trafficking ring. She comes to Italy but doesn't seem too bothered with investigating the actual criminals. She just hangs around harrassing Denzel, who is not even trying to hide that he's guilty of many murders at this point. She acts like she's this accomplished agent, but literally all she does is repeat Denzel's findings to her superiors and take the credit for them. She explodes somewhere halfway through the movie and they basically give her a promotion and a medal of honor for it.The mafia itself starts out quite menacing. They are well cast and very violent, but by the time Denzel finally starts killing them (over an hour into the movie) he immediately kills off all the good mobsters in an underwhelming 30 second shot. That's that then. Now all we have left is Victor, a stereotypical mob boss with not much character to him. He's just evil and he likes money and Ferraris. He is now real angry at Denzel for killing his brother and they have a standoff in the town square. It's quite cool and I was getting ready for an amazing shootout, but instead Victor just leaves to go eat spaghetti with his friends. I'm not kidding. This mob boss, apparently the head of five huge crime families, then goes to take a nap with only a few bodyguards around even though he knows this masterful assassin is hunting him down.The final action scene mostly just killed my last bit of hope for this movie. The kills are dull and are just Denzel picking off guards with a knife one by one in pitch dark rooms. Victor barely puts up a fight and basically dies by getting hit by a Fiat Punto. That was it. The final Equalizer movie is now over and it contained maybe three minutes of actual Equalizing, most of which was incredibly boring. The cinematography is quite beautiful at times, the acting is great across the board, the Italian vibes are amazing and there's a few good and/or funny lines. But overall this movie was just an incredible letdown. I don't mind a slow buildup, but this doesn't build up to anything. The first half could've been great if the second half had a proper payoff, but all Denzel does is drink more tea and kill maybe five people to bring down the entire Italian mafia. The romantic subplot that is set up gets no real conclusion, the ending suddenly introduces a weird plot point that was never mentioned before and then it ends abruptly.Not every action movie has to be John Wick with non-stop firepower, but I do expect there to be some actual action. The Equalizer 3 never really delivers. It's a very pretty display of the Amalfi coast and Denzel's acting, but that's about it. It's a shame.","

He literally sleepwalks, makes faces that seem to mock autistics and stabs /slashes / shoots armies in fewer than the time it took you to read this sentence.The third poorly made action film that I have seen almost back to back, after Jawaan and Gadar 2.

"The Equalizer 3","AfricanBro","1 September 2023","The equalizer always has a ""you should've..."" scene; 'you should've taken the money, you should've let me in' and they're all great. This installment doesn't hold back on action, while the first two films had the most memorable fights, this one still stands on its own. Plot progresses a little slower but still engaging. It's predictable, but that simplicity works in its favor, with no unnecessary additions which for me was the writers exude confidence in their narrative.This is exactly what you'd expect from an Equalizer film. The protagonist is more humane and compassionate, yet the action maintains its brutality. It's a journey of revenge and finding peace, a fitting end to the trilogy. The pacing is good, having serene moments alongside thrilling fights without changing the vibe of the film. The sudden religious rally confused me though; perhaps I just missed something earlier.It's Denzel Washington being a badass, always a treat to watch for me. Didn't give it a perfect rating. While it didn't blow me away, I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it. A trilogy binge-watch would make for a fun day, and I wish they'd re-release it for a triple feature like they did with Black Panther in cinemas.","

Thank you Denzel Washington as always you were perfect in every way possible. It's the perfect most extraordinary mix of good vs evil of any movie and trilogy I've ever seen. The violence is hardcore and bloody but the villains in this case the Camorra or Italian mafia are perfect bad guys for Robert McCall, the Equalizer. The location and cinematography are absolutely fantastic. The story is incredibly realistic. The supporting actors are great but at the end of the day it's all about Denzel and Antoine Bravo gentlemen for a sensational trilogy and for bringing bringing me personally such satisfaction.","

"The Equalizer 3","GusherPop","2 September 2023","""The Equalizer 3"" is the best in Denzel Washington's film series, embracing an old western formula, specifically ""Shane."" The ""final chapter"" offers more dramatic heft and equalizing elements. The third installment by Washington, director Antoine Fuqua, and screenwriter Richard Wenk possesses sentimentality, reuniting the star with Dakota Fanning almost 20 years after his death in ""Man on Fire."" The film follows retired assassin Robert McCall, who helps those in need in Italy, where the Mafia provides ample human cannon fodder to eliminate. ""Equalizer 3"" begins with an R-rated opening sequence. McCall, a wounded gunfighter, is taken to a seaside village where the locals welcome him. He considers hanging up his guns and settling down, but the Mafia plans to take over the town, leaving him with a choice: to intervene or not. The film explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions in a dangerous world. The film is a thrilling and thought-provoking exploration of the complexities of human relationships. ""The Equalizer 3"" is a film that explores the fallout from a crime scene and a tip given to a young CIA agent by Robert McCall. The film cleverly weaves together various strands, providing emotional resonance despite the generic threat and big crime boss. The film, which has been released nine years after its first release, has a sequel and a CBS version starring Queen Latifah. Although not entirely convincing as a ""final"" film, it feels like it reaches a point where the story ends on a positive note for Robert McCall and all things equal. The film's emotional resonance is enhanced by the use of quiet strength and the presence of Andrea Scarduzio. The Equalizer 3 is the final destination on a nearly decade-long journey for the filmmaker and his leading man, Matt Washington. McCall, a government assassin, faces injustice and is unable to ignore it. After being rescued by a Good Samaritan, he finds a community under the oppressive and violent fist of local crime bosses, the Sicilian mafia. All hell breaks loose as McCall protects his new friends and their livelihoods. Washington appears more at ease in McCall's skin than ever, despite the internal battle he's going through. His ability to manifest this in both moments of calm (such as his ritualistic setting in a cafe) and moments of violence (such as picking off bad guys in a dark alley) is incredible. The character feels more of a personal stake in his actions, which is interesting as he has always dispensed justice with contained and almost indifferent rage. While not Washington's best work, it's a great performance hanging on the frame of another tight script by Richard Wenk, and it's undoubtedly his best turn in the franchise. The Equalizer 3 is a visceral sequel to Antoine Fuqua's franchise, featuring McCall's simple skillset and Washington's icy delivery. The film showcases Washington's ability to switch from sympathetic to killer, making him a step ahead of his enemies. However, the film's yawn-worthy, bordering-on-troubling context for its baddies prevents it from reaching the rewatchable heights of its predecessors, making it a less enjoyable experience.","

"The Equalizer 3","gimili3979","4 September 2023","The movie, Equalizer 3, starts out well. There is a rather good slow action scene to start the movie. But it is all downhill from there.Without ever really establishing a plot or a reason for why the Equalizer is where he is today, the movie does not flow like the other films. There is a mafia connection, but nothing else to really tell us why the Equalizer is doing what he is doing or why he is even still there.Like so many sequels, there is usually either more sex, blood, or violence. For Equalizer 3, it is definitely violence. There are some scenes where you almost have to look away because of how violent they are.It is just an awful story line about mafia, drugs, and possible terrorist ties that did not make sense. Like the film itself, everyone seems to know that Mr. McCall, the Equalizer, is a special person whereas the previous films tended to hide his unique abilities. There is no anonymity to the person or the story anymore.The previous plots were personal in nature while this one is completely impersonal. We get a hint at the end of the movie that there might have been a personal connection, but the story line is so convoluted that I could not figure out what the personal connection was or how it fit.The movie has enough action to get through it. But do not expect the level of story and plot line like you found in the first film or even the second. It simply is not there. Like a lot of sequels, this movie gets away from what made it such a good first movie to begin with.","

"The Equalizer 3","kevxzara","4 October 2023","Equalizer 3 well....This movie is a complete bore fest of a film. It is nothing like the other 2 at all.Most of the movie consists of watching denzel on the phone, drinking tea or walking around.Gone are the times you remember from the first movie with him checking his watch for how long it takes him to kill the bad guys. The reason for this is because you don't really see him kill any bad guys (a handful).Denzel character never felt in danger so i dont know why the trailer made it out like he met his equal as i dont recall him getting injured whilst In his new found happy place.So many people at the start of the movie have guns (adults) but yet doesn't get shot until a small child takes aims and fires and nearly kills denzel.All in all set in a nice back drop but honestly if you don't speak Italian or can't read the subtitles then you won't have a clue what's going on as majority of movie is in Italian.Conclusion = boring movie, lazy script, boring bad guys, nothing really ever happens unless you enjoy tea.Was it a good send off? NO NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.","

"The Equalizer 3","douglasmcbroom","6 January 2024","This is the best of the three Equalizer film's. The setting is spectacular! In fact, the tourism board of Atrani, Italy, on the Amalfi Coast, should send Director Antoine Fuqua a huge dish of Gnocchi alla Sorrentina!This is also the most violent and bloody of the three films. There are homage's paid to 'The Godfather,' 'Godfather: Part II' and 'Scarface' (in one scene). It also has the best storyline of the 3 films. That credit goes to writer Richard Wenk. Denzel is almost too old for this role, but he might have one more in him. Of course, as always, he's too cool for school!Frankly, this was the most entertaining film of 2023 I have seen, and that includes: 'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer,' 'Maestro,' and 'Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning,' although I haven't seen 'Killers of the Flower Moon,' yet. Let's face it, it was not a very good year for feature films!","

"The Equalizer 3","rgkarim","2 September 2023","LIKES:The Music:
-Simple, but powerful, a track that holds the spirit of the Equalizer with its mighty instruments blaring and loud drums.-It holds so much in the tones and when used together with the powerful scenes and acting unleashed a power shot that makes the theater shake.-The majestic attitude of the pieces are awesome, and the versatility to it is subtle, but works very well for what they accomplished in the movie. Fantastic in just how much it adds.The Cinematography:
-One of the high points, the movie is solid in how much it captures with the shots they chose.-The filters are perfect to convey the mood, dark and foreboding at times, bright and hopeful in others, and a middle ground that conveys the level of the threat.-It captures so much of the culture of the setting, the feelings of the villains in their savagery, and the moments of dark dread and discovery to really hit hard.-And then you bring the moments of justice, the Equalizer trying to equal and adding that emotion that you love in these movies as the blow is dealt.-Every shadow, very alley, and every finishing moment drips emotion and I love that about this franchise in how it delivers that raw edge.The Sound Editing:
-Another small trick, another effective treat to help with hitting the high notes and putting another layer of the Equalizer.-The sound engineering is top notch, those awesome bytes brought in at the right moments to emphasize the movie.-Wet sounds of knives, blaring gun noises, and several other things add that realistic horror noise that fans love to hear. And other effects of crashing and destruction ring out to add to the carnage that smashes the ears and brings you into fun.The Acting:
-Another wonderful addition to the mix, Equalizer's setting welcomes the acting traits of the character and the talents they bring.-Mastandrea holds charm, that moral drive and character to pull the whole movie together in many ways. He's compelling, he's fun, he's sincere and sweet, and works super well with his cast to convey the family feeling.-Fanning is totally great in this role. She's not the most interesting or really intense CIA agent, but for the purpose of the character she works. Her dry delivery works with Denzel's demeanor, making a sort of body cop design of the characters thrive and have that charm I like to lighten up the movie without destroying the tones too much.-And Washington is of course the top tier actor who does so little and yet so much with his performances.-His lines might be monotone and seldom waver from the calm neutral, but the way he adds the inflections, the little pauses, and those hints of surprise help give them light.-While physical acting and mannerisms are a level on themselves giving the Equalizer that other half of the coin that is scary, intense, but good in many ways.-And the chemistry with so many people, touching up moments without straying too far from the character achieves in this series. What a great acting performance.The Story/Emotions
-Equalizer always has that underlying moral aspect that identifies but sells it in just the right touch of things to add that satisfaction without going into the cheese zone.-And this movie may do it the best in terms of the storytelling. Equalizer is not really the best in terms unique plot lines or surprises, but what it suffers in cliché succeeds in execution.-This town he dwells in has a lot of charm and heavy character centric morals that are stalwart and the anchor to which we have everything latched on to.-Not enough? Well how about the fact that you get this stellar tie in to the other films and in a way that takes the relationships and fosters them to motivational heights?-Still not enough, well how about the effects of what happens during this movie and elevates Robert to that same level of heroism we love?-That's the feelings that I got watching, and the biggest punch of the movie and what I felt gave reason to go through the dark chaos again and the violence. That's the level of storytelling and use that a writer like me likes and what I hope you will enjoy as well.DISLIKES:Predictable:
-The plot sort of follows the same song and dance routine, and given the origins it's not expected.-You know who is going to suffer, you know how he is going to strike, and from the trailers can piece together the plot in minutes, including most of the big twist.-Throw in the foreshadowing and you really are only left with how gory will the kill be and those small details you forgot about in the beginning.Violence is the Highest:
-It's a vicious movie, and like the originals is a rated R movie for a reason.-This one though holds a savagery that exceeds the previous and so be careful because you are going to get things that might be disturbing enough to make you sick.-The sounds with the vicious actions are not holding back, with gruesome gore and death awaiting those at every scene. And sometimes it gets a tad excessive to go the routes, even though they add a bit of diversity.The Suspense/Mystery/Action are lacking
-It depends on what gives you the thrills and chills, but for me, this movie did not quite accomplish the task of the most thrilling movie.-Sure , it's got the justice action that delivers that moral satisfaction, but the journey to get there is a little bland.-Bad guys are cruel, with awful tempers, and degrading features, but they aren't the worst bunch in the land, nor really that imposing of rivals.-Even when the stakes get heated, this supposed antagonist group is quite mediocre in regards to the fight put up.-The mystery and the motivation behind it are realistic with the tones, but without that spark is rather bland nor mind blowing when the answers come out.-And as for the fights, again Equalizer 1 and 2 do more than this one, still showing Denzel being awesome, but just one sided and kind of lackluster in terms of the most stylish or unique finishes.The VERDICT:
Equalizer 3 succeeds on many levels for a third installment tying things up with the finish and polish that you hope this series will have. The movie has great sound editing and visual style that does a lot of the lifting and adds that edge this series is known to have. A strong acting crew further helps paint this little Italian family together, blending that attitude with good characters that become the central story component of this series. And with it, the story and morals that this series has are good, primarily the heavy moral components and the way it ties to the cold hard steel man that visits it. It holds so many great moments that really are that justice dealing goodness, with a set of finishes that though violent, hold so much bite to them in many ways. And to seal and tie everything together the way they did it, was classy and in check with the series. However, the movie is extremely dark and gory, easily earning the rated R mark and sometimes to a degree that is going to make people potentially not comfortable secondary to the level of extreme violence that was on profile. Sadly, the story, mystery, and the action did not quite make the violence and darkness not worth the investment at times, at least in terms of an action thriller sense. The endings of the others held that merit and wow factor, but this one, though again cool, just doesn't have that same spectacle or intensity the others did. Thus, it loses points in that regards, at least for this reviewer. Factoring all these together, my scores are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"The Equalizer 3","thekingmanx","2 September 2023","NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE. There are no characters, there is no story, there is no action, there are no stakes, there is no moral or message or point. THERE IS NO POINT TO THIS MOVIE.Every character are stiff one dimensional pieces of cardboard. About 60% of this movie is just Denzel sitting around in a town in Italy doing jack becoming seen as ""one of them"". The villains are just some stereotypical mafia guys who are so laughably evil in cruel it's not even fun to hate them.The action in this movie is sooooooooo brief too. Denzel is pretty much never in danger and always just quickly assassinates the villians.And easily the worst part of this movie is the climax, because just when things are seeming to start ramping up, the movie is just over. Basically the big mafia boss comes to the town and threatens everyone because Denzel killed his brother in an earlier scene. So at this point you think there might finally be some big action payoff at the end. Nope. Instead what happens is Denzel just magically teleports to the bad guy's house (which he never knew the location of but whatever) and assasinates every guard one by one and then the boss without any sort of struggle. And that's it. He basically just kills everyone with no struggle. In a good movie, this kind of big bad mafia villian would be made to seem untouchable, and it would be an actual struggle for are hero to get to them and kill them. But in the Equalizer 3 are hero just kills a dozen men with no problem. There is no stakes no struggle no sense of urgency. You have no reason to be invested because at no point do you feel like there is any sort of danger.","

"The Equalizer 3","Johnny_West","24 January 2024","Denzel is going to be 70 years old in 2024. Hard to believe. He is the one person that can do a Clint Eastwood better than Liam Neeson. I enjoyed this movie mostly because of Denzel.The story was really goofy. Denzel blows away 20 Mafia goons and a godfather, and then some little kid shoots him? He is miraculously rescued, which would be very doubtful since that little kid ran away, most likely to whomever was left of his family, and unconscious Denzel would have been killed off.Also unlikely is that the Police officer goes back to where all the Mafia guys were killed to pick up Denzel's car? Like nobody would have asked him why he was picking up the car of the guy that killed an entire Mafia family?If you pay attention, there were a fair amount of goofs, but this is an old school, 1960s type of movie, where you just sit back and enjoy watching Denzel make friends in Italy, and then kill all the bad guys. I enjoyed it. It was fun.So what if they filmed in one town but named it after another town that is not near the coast? So what if three guys are pointing guns at Denzel from different angles and he is sitting down, and yet manages to kill them all?One thing that I would have enjoyed is if the Doctor had more discussions with Denzel. There could have been a backstory about him and World War II and friendships with American soldiers that his family always remembered (for example).","

Does the good make up for the bad? There is a weight to killing. It weighs on your soul. Friends that do it for the military say it changes a person. The story is laid out in the commercials.

The scenes in Italy were lovely. I doubt we will see another one of these movies. This was an old school action thriller. The formula is pretty tried and true.

Denzel's performance, has McCall, feeling his age and mortality catching up with him. Dakota Fanning is also great has an agent, and her scenes with Washington are a highlight, they both where in Man on Fire (2004), you see the awesome chemistry with them.

"The Equalizer 3","luca-settembre","11 January 2024","The Equalizer 3 is the last chapter of the Equalizer franchise, and is directed by Antoine Foqua, and stars, of course, Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, and Dakota Fanning as a CIA officer.As an action movie fan, I really enjoyed the Equalizer movies, still being aware that we are not talking about masterpieces. They are fun and enjoyable vigilante movies where Denzel Washington is freaking cool and badass as he takes down, alone, large and structured criminal organizations. Without the value he brings into these movies, I don't know if they would be even worth watching. The Equalizer 3 fits perfectly into this path, with some slight changes.The first thing to say is that this movie is very very gory and brutal, much more compared to the first two movies. Clearly it was decided to go one level up, so one needs to be prepared. The movie looks very dark, the Italian Mafia gives sort of modernized Godfather vibes, and most importantly, is beautifully shot. All of that can be appreciated since the very beginning of the movie, where fantastic camera work is done as the viewer follows a man entering a building full of dead people, brutally murdered. This very intense initial scene really sets the tone of the movie, to which the music score also fits really well.The movie is located in a tiny Italian village, whose people are constantly threatened by the mafia, where ""business"" brought McCall (Denzel), too. This is the third big action movie to be shot in Italy (after Indy 5 and Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning) to come out in theaters in 2023, at least that I know of. Whether or not this decision is based on financial benefits of some sort, it provided The Equalizer 3 with beautiful and picturesque scenery.As an Italian and fan of Denzel Washington, it was really entertaining to watch Denzel Washington sitting at the cafe, talking broken Italian, making friends, getting familiar with the people and the quiet atmosphere of the town. I found the representation of the town and of the people authentic, very well done, and not too stereotypical. The Italian language is real Italian spoken by Italian actors, the accents are real, the film is shot in different Italian towns on the Amalfi coast, and so on. One can see the great attention to detail and care that was put into the making of this movie, which I mentioned above about the directing. I did have a ""what?!"" moment, though, that I could not wrap my head around: Aminah (Gaia Scodellaro) takes McCall on a tour of the village, by telling him that she'll help him discover the authentic food specialties of the town. As they go on a stroll and talk, they pass by some food stands, and Aminah shows McCall different authentic Italian dishes. Then, however, she invites him to grab a Kebab (great, but not Italian at all!), which he does! Seriously, what happened there? There was all that nice fish and stuff, too-why a Kebab??I have read a lot of criticism about the action in this movie, especially about it being too little. The problem that I see with the action is with the fact that McCall is never really challenged by any of his enemies rather than with the length of the action scenes. In other words, none of the villains or his men are even close to Robert McCall's level, so it seems quite easy for him to take them down in creatively brutal ways. This applies, unfortunately, also to the ending of the movie, which is, anyway, very very powerful. Also, the non-action parts build the tension between McCall and the villain, and they are not boring at all.Another weak point of the movie, from my point of view, has to do with some of the supporting characters and their relationship to the hero (McCall). Dakota Fanning's character (CIA) could have been a very good helper in the fight against the mafia, but instead she ends up not doing so much at all... Along with that, one aspect of McCall being in this town is the attachments that the townspeople form with him, but we actually don't have much evidence of this beyond him eating in a cafe once in a while. We do see McCall having an emotional response when they are threatened, we do see him getting comfortable in the town, but while a deeper layer to that is mentioned, the viewer doesn't directly witness this: for example, when McCall says that the people of the town brought him peace, or that he understood that this is the place where he belongs. All these sentiments sound a bit out of place and don't match the level of interactions that we as viewers have witnessed. We expect some deeper character development to happen in the ""kebab""/walks scene, but the dialogue between McCall and Aminah doesn't actually build to anything relevant.Overall, a very good and extremely brutal vigilante movie, with some weaknesses, very well shot, with a fantastic Denzel Washington doing very badass things. Worthwhile final chapter, 7 stars!","

By the way, all three movies are based on the 1985 tv series starring Edward Woodward, not the current Queen Latifah one. The first movie was in 2014 and the second was in 2018, all starring Denzel as Robert McCall. This one starts with Denzel at a farmhouse in southern Italy. He is retrieving a set of keys from some very bad guys. FYI: You learn later what the keys are for. Just as Denzel is thinking that he can settle down in a small Italian town, he learns that his actions have set off a series of events with some other very bad guys, called the Mafia. Andrea is their local representative and he is not a happy camper. Remo plays the local doctor that helps Denzel when he gets into some trouble and Dakota is the C. I. A.

This finale exudes a riveting blend of vengeance and virtue, set against the picturesque yet perilous backdrop of Southern Italy, a departure from the urban sprawl we're accustomed to from its predecessors.The narrative unfolds with a sinister Sicilian mobster's world coming undone, an ode to McCall's relentless quest for justice. Washington's embodiment of a righteous avenger resonates with a sense of authenticity that is as engaging as it is awe-inspiring. His transition from a humble dweller to a harbinger of retribution is seamless, affirming his prowess in action-heavy roles, despite the generational gap with contemporary action stars.The film doesn't shy away from delivering a gleefully violent spectacle, with each punch thrown and bullet fired reverberating the core essence of McCall's crusade against the unyielding Sicilian Mafia. The atmospheric tension is palpable, bearing the signature touch of Fuqua's directorial finesse. Amidst the relentless action, what shines through is McCall's affinity for the innocuous folk of his newfound haven, accentuating the dichotomy of his violent endeavors and his quest for tranquility.Equalizer 3 also subtly explores McCall's coping with the ghosts of his past, while forging ahead on a merciless path of retribution. Though the subplot involving Emma, a young CIA analyst, leaves something to be desired, it doesn't detract from the film's core narrative.The narrative rhythm is maintained with meticulous care, ensuring a robust pace that keeps the adrenaline pumping, yet providing those moments of reflection, showcasing a meditative side amidst a storm of violence.In closing, Equalizer 3 isn't just a movie, it's an experience that leaves you at the edge of your seat, yet introspective about the dichotomy of good and evil, and the lengths one goes to uphold justice. The film is a fitting closure to a saga that has enthralled audiences with a raw depiction of vigilante justice, embodied by an actor who continues to defy age and expectations in delivering compelling performances.","

"The Equalizer 3","zeeshanabid","4 October 2023","Equalizer 1 is one of my most favorite movies of all times. So the bar was already very high for the second part - which was kind of disappointment, but was still not extremely bad. This part, however, is atrocious. I really don't understand all these 10/10 ratings here. Even 7 is overrating for this piece of trash. There is no story and no action, and really, it's an extremely boring movie. If you're really into watching Denzel drinking his tea/coffee, watch the movie, as this is what he's doing in about 50% of the movie. And in rest of most of the movie he's just walking here and there for showing us some scenary. If we skim the movie's real material it will be a total of les than 15 minutes, 5 minutes of which was action. The script was for a short movie I think but they made it into a long movie.","

"The Equalizer 3","coastdaze","7 September 2023","I had no real expectations, good or not, regarding this 3rd installment of the Equalizer series. I like Denzel Washington movies so I was simply happy to see him again on the big screen. E1 & 2 were really enjoyable to watch. E3 left me thinking I'd like to see #4, but then at the end of the movie, I thought it'd be fine to not see another one. E3, imo, was so good I could leave it here. As one reviewer posted, ""Denzel is so damn cool""...yep, there's no doubt about that. While E3 is different from the other 2, it is well-written, kept me guessing and as usual Denzel doesn't ""act"", he ""is"". What's next for Mr. Washington? Dunno, but I hope he doesn't wait years to bring it to the big screen again.","

"The Equalizer 3","ItsRobinTV","31 August 2023","Don't get me wrong the movie was great! Even though Denzel Washington isn't the youngest any more his action scenes are brutal and just awesome to watch.The problem is that the movie has very few action scenes with Denzel and literally 20 minutes after his first real Purge against the bad guys we get to the final showdown, which doesn't feel like one, and then we are left feeling like we are still in the 2nd Act because a lot is still very unclear especially concerning the mafia.To see such a week ending/3rd Act after the amazing ending/3rd Act of the 2nd one is pretty disappointing, however balances the best opening from this trilogy which results in a good but nothing more movie.","

"The Equalizer 3","Holt344","26 September 2023","This film has Denzel Washington reuniting with Dakota Fanning after having worked together nearly 20 years ago in Man on Fire, they had chemistry back then and it's nice to see them as scene partners again. The Equalizer 3 is the final part of the trilogy and is once again directed by Antoine Fuqua who produced it alongside a handful of others, including Denzel Washington.Robert McCall finds himself at home in Southern Italy but he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia.""Are you good or bad?"" a question McCall can't answer which is a good thing. The thing is, he's as grey as you can be. Feeling no empathy for the people in organized crime he brutally kills, whilst feeling empathy for others who are kind. Throughout these three movies we have seen him do some truly horrific things to other human beings, yet we're still voting for him, and you clearly see he has lost all hope in the beginning when he gets shot by that kid and decides to put the pistol against his temple and pull the trigger, thinking he had bullets left. That's a strong scene and what comes after that? Him turning his life around with three characters which inspires him and improves him as a person; Remo Girone as Enzo Arisio, Gio Bonucci and Gaia Scodellaro as Aminah. The first two were the stand outs for me, great performances! Another performance worth talking about is of course Dakota Fanning as Emma Collins, the reveal at the end with her actually being the daughter of Robert's late handler Susan Plummer which was a nice way of closing the chapter of McCall's life along with his new life in Altamonte.The Equalizer 3, what are my thoughts on it? The conclusion of a trilogy which I've loved since the first film, yet never met the same quality as the first Equalizer film. At its best, it comes close to that same quality. The action is where my expectations are high and if you watch it, you'll probably find yourself in my shoes, satisfied. With Denzel Washington headlining the film and Antoine Fuqua in the director chair, this duo is incredible and as great as ever in this film. Fuqua knows how to direct action, also thriller with realism. I just love the partnership they have, also the one he shares with Robert Richardson, the cinematographer, which is their second cooperation. Editor, Conrad Buff, is another person who has collaborated on multiple projects. The pacing is great and overall, the editing is spectacular. Honestly, I thought it was a satisfying conclusion and a terrific action thriller. Denzel Washington is as great as ever in the role, giving something new to the role, also the character aging is noticed and I think they handled that nicely. The writing was great, I really liked it. I thought it could have been longer because of how the ending felt a little bit rushed. The mise-en-scene was terrific, each scene was beautifully shot and directed. The tension and suspension was there from beginning to end which is impressive because of how the pacing is, it's quite slow which is the reason why I have liked these films so much. You get to know the characters, see how well written they are, especially Robert McCall. The story was really good, possibly the most emotional one yet. I really liked it being set in Italy, made sense with the Camorra. This was a satisfying conclusion to The Equalizer Trilogy, a great action thriller.","

"The Equalizer 3","Top_Dawg_Critic","2 September 2023","All this third and final installment was, the same old story but in a different setting, with much less action, and a pointless walking cane that saw zero action. Washington carries the film and is impressive as always, but the writing was way more formulaic, cheesy, with lots of plot holes and ridiculous sub plots riddled with cliches. To make matters worse, Fuqua's choice to have the film set in beautiful Italy failed when most of the film needed English subtitles that took away from appreciating the Italian settings and landscapes, and the subtitles weren't on the screen long enough (not everyone is a speed reader) to make out what dialogue was being spoken in Italian. Technically, this was an Italian film with maybe 10% spoken English, and spending so much time reading subtitles took away from the entertainment value. Nevertheless, Denzel did what Denzel does and did it very well, and is the only reason to see this film.","

"The Equalizer 3","Leofwine_draca","8 January 2024","This sequel is the third and least of the series and marks a big drop in quality from the level of the first two. Those ones were action-packed rivals to JOHN WICK, while this is much lower budgeted and feels somewhat half-hearted given what's come before. Denzel Washington is feeling his age for the first time, routinely doubled in the film's few action sequences, and barely showing up at all for the disappointing climax. The first half is all slow build and quite engaging with it, the gangster threat nicely menacing. But the second promises so much and disappoints with a lazy and generic showdown. Denzel can only do so much, after all.","

"The Equalizer 3","Vivekmaru45","4 October 2023","I saw the first in 2014 and nine years later, hopefully, the conclusion to this trilogy. The main emphasis of these movies are crime and punishment. The Equalizer is like a person who punishes evil people who are beyond the reach of the law. There are so many movies like these that I will not even begin to recommend which ones for you to see. Denzel Washington is a great favorite actor of mine. I've seen countless films of his, some very good like Fallen(1998) and Deja Vu(2006). He has acted in diverse films spanning many genres. He is an actor that can make you smile or cry depending on the role he is portraying.This movie is basically just an all out war between Denzel's character Robert McCall and the Mafia. So you would typically expect over-the-top violence and action. And this is where director Antione Fuqua excels. Training Day(2001) and Tears Of The Sun(2003) are two excellent movies of his.Verdict: if you want to complete watching the trilogy then go ahead. However for me this is nothing but repetitious action and acting. If you've seen all the 80's action classics like First Blood(1982), Commando(1985), Raw Deal(1986), The Delta Force(1986), Die Hard(1988), Red Heat(1988) then give this one a skip.","

The music was also decent but otherwise this film was a bore. The action is limited to about 3 sequences. The opening action sequence which is shown in the trailers is the best one out of all of them.The villains are the most cliché villains ever that don't ever truly feel like a threat. All of the characters were very weak and unmemorable.The story was just uninteresting which made things worse since there was hardly any action.This is a very disappointing ending to this trilogy.

"The Equalizer 3","onpointmag","5 September 2023","I love me some Denzel Washington, God knows I do, but this is my least favorite movie with him starring in. Not because of him, but because they did waaaay too much! For starters did the camera person really need to spend the 1st five minutes of the movie walking past dead bodies. We got the point! Denzel (aka Robert McCall) killed them all. (Sorry Fuqua, you are an exceptionally talented director & the body of work you put on the big scree is awesome, believable work) But (in terms of writing) an overload of dead bodies alone, does not make a great story. A great turn of events does. Anyway... No one will probably admit it but the story line was long & unengaging. In the first two movies Denzel was a person with heart, spirit, and influence. In EQ3 he's no more than a menace, a vigilante. His killing started before we even knew why. It also seem like they weren't quite sure if they wanted to write this movie as an action flick, an emotional drama, or a travel blog and just show all the beautiful buildings, food & culture of Italy. I loved the first two installments, but this is blase at best. No wonder during an interview when the host told Denzel she was surprised to see him make a 3rd sequel, Denzel said, he thought Robert McCall had run his course too, but ""apparently they felt McCall still had work to do"". It's almost like he felt his presence in the movie was an after thought too... cause that's exactly how I felt watching it. Sure, he was in every scene, but his presence wasn't valuable enough, if you ask me. Still, I love Denzel. He hasn't loss a thing. The man commands the screen & is still one of the best actors to ever exist.","

"The Equalizer 3","kuner-59029","4 October 2023","The Equalizer 3 is a strange film, so strange that I wonder how it was greenlit in the first place.The entire film takes place in Italy, and about 85% of the dialogue is in Italian. One has to admire them for doing this. It's always ridiculous in films when Russian or Italian gangsters suddenly speak English with each other. They went for realism in the language department.However, the rest of the film feels like a slow, horrible, surreal fever dream. Right off the bat the color grading jumps out at you. The colors are so desaturated, they may as well have filmed in black and white. The film opens with a landscape shot of Sicilily, and it looks like some brown-yellow-greyish mess, similar to the movie 300, but without that film's comic book stylings and bursting earthen red tones.Anyone who has ever been to Italy can attest to it being a very colorful country with usually great weather and the sunlight bringing out popping colors. Here it looks like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. This stands in stark contrast to the harmonious life the film is trying to portray.The depictions of Italians is a caricature and could be considered racist.For one, the Film depicts Italy as a crime ridden hellhole run by sadistic gangs that terrorize the people and the police, cut off people's hands, torture them, even bomb the police. It's a joke. Italy is one of the safest countries in the world. Even Germany's murder rate is twice as high. The US's murder rate is 12 times as high!I've worked in Italy multiple times and had run ins and dealings with the Mafia. They're scum. But not like in the movie.They portray Italians as tranquil peasants, sitting at cafes and wearing 1950s clothing, sitting there like sheep passing the time, waiting for mafia thugs to come and terrorize them. A scene at a school depicts the children wearing school uniforms. This hasn't been the case in Italy since Mussolini.The mafia are portrayed as thugs on motorcycles with face tattoos, who in broad daylight loot a hotel, terrorize people (a cop even) in restaurants, and feel more like stereotypical Hollywood Russian mob hitmen.In reality, the Mafia works almost entirely behind the scenes via corruption. They're invisible. They're not street thugs with face tattoos. They work in city administration, customs, transportation, construction. They mainly syphon public funds away by having controlling interests everywhere and putting people in power on their payroll (or sometimes intimidating them).In my personal case, our business had to pay bribes to the actual police. Multiple times. They threaten you with some bulls**t code violation and openly tell you they will shut you down for a few weeks and drag things out, so it's cheaper to just pay them.The Mafia would never lay hands on a policeman or cut the hand off of a chief of police like in the movie. The idea that a crime family can intimidate police is laughable. The police in Italy are as militarized as everywhere else in the world. Just a bit more corrupt. Thugs in uniform. No one in their right mind would mess with them. There's no profit in that.The mafia has its hands in everything, but they don't go around randomly butchering people, raping their children and other things alluded to in this film.So all that said, the Italy depicted here is a fantasy Italy, much like the fantasy Sparta and Persia in the aforementioned 300.I'm not faulting the film for having a fantasy setting, but if you have a fantasy setting, this should be reflected in the tone. V for Vendetta, 300, Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, Braveheart, there are tons of examples of films that distort reality to fit the tone of the story.But the tone of Equalizer 3 is... a mess. What tone were they even going for?A political spy thriller involving the Mafia, ISIS and corruption? Too unrealistic and silly.An hommage to a gritty 70s Italo crime thiller? Too sombre for that.A sombre drama? The story's too simple and the characters too thin for that.A Liam Neeson style silly violent power fantasy? Too slow and not enough action.The film lacks a coherent tonal language. The only thing that is consistent is the violence. This film is not just gory, but sadistic. While movie violence doesn't shock me anymore, in this case it still appalled me. The film revels in people being slaughtered. It's shot in a semi realistic way, but absolutely glorified. Eyes are stabbed, limbs broken until the bones exit the wounds, people are crushed by cars, hacked in the face with meat cleavers... you get the idea. One scene even depicts a killing spree in first person view like a video game. This film has no moral compass, because it presents the violence a human misery in these desaturated, naturalistic colors, while at the same time glorifying it as if it were an awesome video game killstreak.Despite all the gore, the violence is still played safe. Only men and mostly only the bad guys get it. The scene where the mafia beats up the cop in his apartment in front of his wife and daughter would have been far more effective, if they had forced him to watch them beat the wife or even daughter. But they don't get so much as a scratch. The movie tries to be hard, but chickens out where the violence would actually be shocking instead of just abrasive.As a filmmaker you have a choice when it comes to violence. You can make it cartoony and fun (i.e. Robocop), or you can go the Saving Private Ryan / Schindler's List route, keep it realistic and shocking, and focus on the suffering to tell a story. This combines the two in the worst way: Focus on the suffering and misery and present it as cool. It's akin to putting Heavy Metal over the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan.Like many modern low budget films, the pacing is extremely slow. Long shots of people walking through halls, entering rooms or exiting cars pad the run time. With tighter editing, it could have been 25 minutes shorter.These are some major flaws. It doesn't help that the story is stupid, paper thin and unrealistic.However, the movie does have some undeniable qualities in terms of craftsmanship. Denzel Washington steals every scene he is in. He is supremely talented, and breathes life into his character with many little quips, little smiles, nods, the way he moves his eyes, tilts his head. There's a lot of subtlety going on.The scene with him and the CIA agent at a café is a highlight in terms of both writing and acting. The dialogue is sharp and full of wit, and Denzel manages to be curteous, unassuming and dangerous at the very same time.Some of the scenes with him and the locals like the doctor or the policeman are extremely well acted as well. If you're a fan of his, you will get your money's worth. He used to be in a lot of big films, and it's a shame to see him relegated to smaller productions recently. He still feels like he could helm intelligent blockbusters like he did 30 years ago.Instead we get this.","

"The Equalizer 3","jtsteve-85230","11 September 2023","This was definitely the worst out of the trilogy. It lacks the action that you definitely associate with The Equalizer, even if the opening seemed to be especially brutal. In fact, much of the movie doesn't really strike me as a film that Antoine Fuqua had much involvement in. McCall doesn't seem to scan the environment for weapons or even do much of what the title implies he does. Ninety percent of the film is him spending time in a small town just hanging out with the locals, with Mafia thrown in for a couple of scenes as an afterthought.That, and half of the film seems to focus on Dakota Fanning's character, who isn't really interesting enough to hold your attention for a terrorism subplot that serves as an afterthought.That, and the movie just ends on an anti-climax that wasn't exactly riveting. The fact most reviews on here are giving this movie 8 or 9 stars is wildly suspicious. That being said, Denzel gives his all, as always, and still ends the movie as an interesting character, as always.","

"The Equalizer 3","TxMike","15 March 2024","Seems every four or five years Denzel Washington makes an 'Equalizer' movie, starring as Robert McCall. I just re-read my review of the first one, McCall as a character doesn't change much, just the situations he finds himself in, and the techniques he uses to eliminate the bad guys.In real life Washington has been vacationing to Italy for over 30 years so that setting was a natural for this movie. McCall considers himself 'retired' and he finds the community of Altamonte and its towns folk to his liking. He is thinking this may just be the place to settle down.Breaking the peace are an Italian mafia family, dealing in drugs, and ruthlessly brutal to any that cross them. McCall witnesses some of them brutally mistreating some of the innocent merchants, this bothers him terribly, he formulates a plan to set things right. Part of his plan involves getting Dakota Fanning as CIA agent Emma Collins on the path of the crime family.This movie is not high art, it uses pretty standard 'good guy vs bad guy' tropes. One reviewer even says it is 'The Magnificent Seven Minus Six', and that is a pretty good comparison. But it is entertaining, and that is the only point of a movie like this. I think most of us find it easy to cheer an 'equalizer' putting the really bad guys in their place.At home on DVD from my public library.","

"The Equalizer 3","view_and_review","26 February 2024","We already know that with action movie sequels they have to have more action. Usually that's more explosions, more gun play, more fighting, and a higher body count. E3 did go for more, but it was more brutality. And it was good.Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is now in Italy. His soft heart and sleuthing brought him there where he would single-handedly take down a criminal family. But, unlike the Godfather, he left alone a child who shot him in the back. He would then spend the next few weeks in a small town in Sicily rehabbing and subsequently finding another group of horrible people needing an attitude adjustment.While he was in Italy so was a CIA operative named Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning). For those that don't know, Denzel and Dakota were paired together 20 years ago in arguably Denzel's best vigilante movie: ""Man on Fire."" In E3 Denzel didn't have to save Emma directly, but he did help her in more ways than one.I liked the change of scenery for E3. They went away from Boston to the very picturesque and idyllic scenery of southern Italy. If ""The Equalizer 3"" did anything it made me want to visit Italy. The aerial shots of the vineyards and seaside village were better than any footage I've seen in any movie featuring Italy. The area was so beautiful and serene it seemed sinful that blood was spilled on its streets.If E2 took a step back from the first Equalizer, then E3 regained the footing. It was again more personal and focused. There was an increase in gore as if Robert had lost his patience dealing with bad guys. Naturally, he needed to be efficient, but he also needed to be more deadly if for any reason than his age. He can't have much fight left in him, so he needs to take care of his enemies quickly.It would seem apropos that The Equalizer would finish up in 2023 when it seems that John Wick has also finished up. Both began in 2014 (seems a lifetime ago), and even though John Wick has one more sequel than The Equalizer, they find themselves finishing up at the same time. Take care of yourself Robert MCCall.","

"The Equalizer 3","Uriah43","4 January 2024","This film begins in Sicily with a former CIA assassin named ""Robert McCall"" (Denzel Washington) killing a number of men involved with drug trafficking and laundering money for a Middle Eastern terrorist organization. Having completed his mission, he then takes some money that was stored in the house and calmly walks out. However, upon doing so, a young boy suddenly emerges with a rifle and shoots him in the back. Although seriously wounded, he manages to escape in his car before eventually losing consciousness on a ferry headed back to the Amalfi Coast. Upon awakening, he finds himself being treated for his wounds by a small-town doctor named ""Enzo Arisio"" (Remo Girone) who graciously allows him to stay in his house until he can sufficiently recover. Grateful for this opportunity, Robert uses this time to stroll around the village and meet the people who live there--eventually being accepted as one of their own. He finally feels at home. Unfortunately, he then discovers that his new friends are being terrorized by a notorious crime family--and he knows what he has to do. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this film was a definite improvement over its immediate predecessor due in large part to the human element and the manner in which the characters interacted with one another. Likewise, the beautiful Italian scenery also enhanced the overall effect as well. Be that as it may, although this film isn't quite as good as the original film in the series, it was entertaining in its own right, and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.","

But what separates The Equalizer from other stories in fhe same genre is the weight of the storyboard- and of course Denzel himself.As always a soft touch at the end lays the movie at rest in a way that makes you feel good after all the inevitable violence necessary to bring justice.This is the same epics that defined the strong silent type like Eastwood - the character that brings all means necessary to the table to sort things out for me and you.

"The Equalizer 3","pmtelefon","16 September 2023","I was really enjoying ""The Equalizer 3"" until the last half hour or so. The movie takes it time developing the story but after a while it doesn't know where to go with it. It's a fun ride most of the way but it wraps things up in a rather unsatisfying way. It's a great looking movie with terrific location photography and Denzel Washington does a nice job but the script lets him down. I've seen all three Equalizer movies, including this one, in the theater (today I was at AMC Raceway 10, Westbury, NY). I enjoyed the first two but I haven't seen them since and I don't remember anything about them. Today I enjoyed most of ""The Equalizer 3"" but I have the feeling that when I go to work on Monday, I won't remember much of this one either.","

"The Equalizer 3","cjonesas","24 January 2024","Anywhere and in any movie you see Italy, Sicily and Naples being romance or action thriller, that's enough to be excited, soar and give above 7!A much better 'The Equalizer' than the second 2018 version with a Robert McCall who gets more superhuman by year and in each and every Equalizer movie.The screenplay and atmosphere are chic, the flow & vibe full of stinging thrills, the acting of the main and supporting cast, goodies and baddies so on point and the action sequences bone-crushingly breathtaking.My only two complaints are the bland role for a talented Dakota Fanning who used to play in a stellar way as a child and seems to have lost her touch as an adult and the second being the little weak and cliched nevertheless heartwarming ending.You ask me, you ask 'The Equalizer' fans, the franchise is not to end as a trilogy.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 7Development: 8Realism: 7Entertainment: 8Acting: 8Filming/photography/cinematography: 8.5VFX: 8.5Music/score/sound: 8.5Depth: 7.5Logic: 6Flow: 7.5Action/crime/thriller: 7Ending: 6.","

"The Equalizer 3","jasontkell","2 September 2023","Get ready to read captions for the majority of this film. The best part of this movie is watching Denzel dine at restaurants and the views of Sicily. This is not an action/thriller movie, but rather a Drama/Crime. Dakota's part in the movie made the plot even worse with her being an analysts to a CIA agent to crack the Italian mob.The first hour of this movie is just watching Denzel
Get accustomed with the towns people. It should only take 10 minutes to visualize a community. You have to wait until the last 10 minutes of the movie to see the person behind the operation. Overall slow burner and poor script.","

"The Equalizer 3","Prismark10","3 September 2023","The Equalizer 3 is essentially the The Seven Samurai minus six of them.Director Antoine Fuqua goes for something slow burn ramped up with shocking bursts of violence.After taking out a cyberterrorist and crime lord in Sicily. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) discovers that they were also importing synthesised amphetamines from Jihadis in Syria. McCall later gets shot in the back by a little kid.He is saved by a passing policeman who takes him to a kindly doctor. As McCall recovers in a small Amalfi coastal town. He finds out that a Mafia gangster is planning to turn the town into a swanky casino resort. Just as he begins to view that town as his home.Fuqua at times make the movie like a beautifully shot travelogue. You would think it was a paid product placement for the Italian Tourism Board.After the opening scenes, it takes a while for McCall to crack some bones. Well he is recuperating himself. Once he does get better, McCall opts for some cold hard violence on the bad guys.I was surprised that McCall was shocked that the Mafia run the show in southern Italy.","

"The Equalizer 3","ethanbresnett","30 August 2023","Denzel Washington teams up with Antoine Fuqua once again, returning to the role of Robert McCall in a solid albeit relatively formulaic threequel.The story finds McCall in Italy, where he attempts to find a semblance of peace after settling in a welcoming community. However it isn't long before the mafia starts to threaten this peace, leading McCall to flex his vigilante muscles once again.If that doesn't necessarily sound like an overly original story it's because it isn't. It follows the same story beats of most 'one man army' type films like John Wick, Taken etc. That's not to say the story is bad. It is perfectly serviceable and delivers what you'd expect, but it doesn't go beyond that.Thankfully the performance of Denzel Washington stops the film feeling overly generic, as he once again conjures up an intriguing protagonist in Robert McCall. His ability to effortlessly switch from charm and charisma to steely and calculated is brilliant to watch. He is just very believable in the role which really grounds the film.As well as this, Dakota Fanning gives a good performance and is perhaps underutilised. Her story thread does feel a little underdeveloped in truth, and maybe should have been fleshed out or dropped entirely.Speaking of being fleshed out, the villains of the piece are as generic as they come. A little more work here would have been appreciated just to add a but more interest.The action that is served up in the film is good but perhaps a tad sparse. A couple of extra sequences or an extension to the existing ones would have been welcome, and would have also helped the pacing slightly, which does feel a little off.Overall The Equalizer 3 is a pretty good ride. Antoine Fuqua doesn't push the boat out too much but he pulls together an enjoyable and engaging film that will be sure to entertain.","

"The Equalizer 3","Youfassa","12 September 2023","I never obsessed over The Equalizer films, I always thought they were decent action movies but I really liked the first one, it was great. I always preferred the john wick franchise over it.This one was not necessarily bad, it was alright but it feels off for some reason and it felt kinda boring, a lot of elements were missing from the previous ones such as the iconic scanning and going into Robert's head and the time counting.This one also felt long as it didn't feel like a three act film but a film with just one long act that takes the span of 2 hours.The story was kinda decent and the fight scenes were still great but I wanted to see more, the only thing that held this film apart was the scenes with Denzel, I legit didn't care about the side characters and other stuff.I still recommend watching it though.","

"The Equalizer 3","Neptune165","2 December 2023","I love Denzel. Best Actor of all time in my opinion. I also like the other equalizer films quite a bit. The first one was a way to show us who the character is and just how skilled he is. The point of the first one was his struggle to re-enter back into the life he had sworn to leave. The second film, our protagonist had a lot to fight for. There was significant adversity in the antagonists he was up against. This third film really didn't have a whole lot of tension. What was supposed to be the problem in this film that our protagonist has to overcome? (Spoilers) He got shot by the kid at the beginning of the film, which was leading me to believe that they were going to go for a ""Even if you take the lives of people who do terrible things, you'll still end up being the villain in someone's story"" type of angle, which is a good one. However, we never hear from the kid again, and he just absolutely stomps a mafia ring without much trouble at all. There was no opposing force that created any type of resistance for our protagonist. Of course the fight scenes are always fantastic, but yeah that's my two cents on this one. Wish there was more to the story than just ""ok he lives happily ever after in Italy now yay"". Also all of this aside, it was beautifully directed, and the actors did a fantastic job with the story they had been given.","

"The Equalizer 3","isantistao","5 November 2023","If you are expecting this to be better than the other two, don't set yourself up for dissapointment. I know, I know, it certainly should be the best of the 3...after all, it takes place in Italy with the real Italian Mafia...but yet somehow there is much less action than the other 2! There are hardly any fight scenes. There's really only 2 scenes that could be called fight scenes, and the fighting is short and involves little choreography. Basically the type of action that you wish to see when you watch a movie like this is almost entirely absent, the opposite of what it should be. Which is frustrating. And that's not the only frustrating part of the movie. Another frustrating part is its predictability and how everything seems to happen just right for the main character. Speaking of which, another frustrating part is how unrealistic it is when this is happening. Which leads me to another frustrating part, which is the unrealistic portrayal of how a man like him would experience Italy, a place known for being rude to outsiders, and especially racist towards black people...yet somehow he experiences no racism, or even rudeness at all, and gets instantaneously welcomed into a community of people who somehow speak perfect english. It's super weak, lame, and frustrating. Not necessarily a bad film. It's scenic and has good cinematography, so it looks nice. It just has really weak writing and non-existent choreography except for those 2 fleeting scenes that can hardly be called fight scenes at all. The story is just so lacking. It seems this trilogy started strong and only got weaker with each installment, which again, is the opposite of how it should be. And the ending of this final film was very anti-climactic too. The main character basically just took down an entire mafia family like knocking down domino's, without sustaining any injuries, or even taking a punch, because there was no fighting what so ever as he was doing it. And then the movie just ended before there could be any retaliation, or seeing what happened to him after he did it. It's just so lame. I'm so disappointed. I'm giving this a 5 because I'm being generous since it wasn't that bad, but it certainly wasn't a good action movie.","

"The Equalizer 3","andreiwanowsky","10 September 2023","The film was terrible. To record my criticism, I wrote down my problems in bullet points.No character development at allWhat do some people find emotional about this film? A man drinking tea in a village and celebrating at the end? It was all fake and superficialFar too many silent scenesIs the protagonist a sadist? He lets the boss die for ages and preys on the corpsesAt the beginning the evil one runs around and sees his dead men, at the end the evil one runs through the area and sees his dead menThe bad guys want to build a casino and make some good people ouch.😢 You don't hate them at all. Has the leader shown any strength other than bossing around?What did the woman in the story do other than let the case be explained to her?What was the bomb about? Kill the woman? The bad guys probably aren't very good at their jobs.Does anyone even want to kill him? All adults with guns don't shoot, but a child pulls the trigger.the person who has been shot is simply helped and no one asks questions?Why is there a scene where they're just driving from the grocery store to the hotel for a minute and dark music is playing.Is riding a motorcycle so scary?He takes off watch, kills, puts on watch, kills. I don't think the clock ever appears except at the beginning.The film consists of introducing villains, killing them, confronting the boss who runs away because the old doctor has a gun and killing the boss. And then everyone is good and happy. Even the scene where the pensioners get their money seems staged.The film looks like an action short film has been stretched to almost 2 hours. Oh well. After all, other people really like the film 😂 As we all know, tastes differ. Hahaha.","

It starts with a bunch of bodies lying around so I was thinking ok maybe they show the action in a flashback afterwards. But well the writers have decided the equalizer is now a ""story"" driven movie and doesn't need action sequences. So of course he gets shot in the back and wakes up in a wonderfull village at the shore in sicilly and a doctor and policemen just fix him without asking questions... ok... He's trying to drink tea and is mocked for it but as he recovers he is getting best friend with the locals. We are 1 hour and 15 minutes in the movie and what happened? Kinda nothin... except some mafia goons harrassing the locals. In the end they try to force in some action but it just doesnt feel rigth. Denzel kills everyone without any kind of trouble he is just in god mode and erradicades everything in sigth. But somehow out of your sigth most of the time. As I said in the beginning I didn't expect much but cmon watching a white wall probably would be more entertaining than this...","

It made you care about randoms and that was good.It went really fast which is an excellent sign, the female agent was great, I'm all for women in roles but just get the casting right!

The more violent the better the film. They didn't understand that it's the story is what makes the film, understanding the how when and why of the characters and their world.So this offering is really really violent but without justification.

"The Equalizer 3","Screen_O_Genic","13 September 2023","Robert McCall is a former marine and spy who finds himself in Sicily on a mission. Events unfold and he ends up confronting and taking on the Italian Mafia. My first foray into the Equalizer universe, this is one Action flick with your usual fistfights, gunshots, mutilations and explosions. One thing that stands out here is the talk. The slow burn chatterbox style of build-up in a film like this which usually never works is on full display and it sure weighs, slows and drags. The story is a fantasy in the vein of ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" where a bald, overweight oddball accomplishes what the entire Italian police force fails to do and brings the Italian Mafia to its knees and lives to tell the tale. The backdrop of Sicily in its old time vintage grime adds sordid splendor to the sketchy plot and erratic pace. Denzel Washington looked like he was doing a job in this flick and you'll feel like you're going through one seeing this to the end. Watchable and nothing to write home about this is a sleeper of the year.","

I remember getting some thrills, fun and excitement from the first two Equalisers but didn't take any from this. By the time Denzel takes out the final villain, I felt woe for humanity of this is what's deemed entertainment these days.

"The Equalizer 3","SnoopyStyle","4 October 2023","In Sicily, crime boss Lorenzo Vitale and his son are returning home to find lots of dead bodies. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is being held prisoner but not for long. After more killings, he is wounded but escapes. He finds safety in a city threatened by other criminals. He calls the CIA and gets operative Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning).Denzel Washington is doing super-fighting and director Antoine Fuqua is bringing his cinematic style. The partnership continues to be solid although the movie franchise keeps drifting away from the original TV premise. This could be any number of avenging vigilante ex-spy superhero. Let's be honest. Denzel is almost seventy. It's less and less reasonable for him to still be super fighting. He needs to fight with experience and brains more than brawn. My favorite scene is the restaurant where he does exactly that. I'm fine with the general idea of a black John Wick or Jason Bourne. Denzel is probably aging out of that role. Everything else is fine. I didn't actually recognize Dakota Fanning although I kept thinking that she looks familiar. Denzel's age does keep bugging me throughout the movie.","

"The Equalizer 3","yasinhussain-14721","30 August 2023","If you're an absolute action fanatic, and you're hoping to see plenty of it in this, lower those expectations now. While there are some fantastic action scenes at the beginning and end, the middle is where things really slow down. Literally like half of this movie is just showing McCall's ordinary day-to-day life in Sicily, which was to me, a very surprising decision by Antoine Fuqua, since anybody with a brain would know that an overwhelming majority of the moviegoers for this are gonna be die-hard action fans, yet this film possibly has the least of that out of the whole trilogy. But what annoys me the most is the fact that our protagonist, our *main* character, barely even has a role in the plot that unfolds. He starts and finishes the story, but other than that, he's almost entirely unnecessary! It's actually Dakota Fanning's character that keeps the story ticking along, and then every now and then Denzel Washington's character drops in a bit of key information to make it *seem* like he's majorly involved. And linking to this, where on Earth does he even get this information from? This was actually a recurring theme throughout the series (so not just in this sequel), but still, certain things just don't have any clear explanation, like for example, how did he figure out the bad guys' location? It doesn't at all make sense. All they had to do was show us how he managed to find out these elusive details and the movie would have flowed along nicely. But as a result of not doing this, it feels like the film untimely jumps straight into the action.But anyway, I'm talking way too negatively about a picture that I actually had a lot of fun with. Even though it does just mainly depict an old man going about his day in a friendly, sociable area of Italy, I strangely didn't get bored in the slightest, even though I could easily describe it as boring (if you can somehow understand what I mean). And the action sequences were epic, just as they were in the prequels to this. Not one bit dragged for me.In conclusion, whilst I'm ever so slightly disappointed that they didn't end on a big one, I am still very satisfied with my cinema trip, as it was a great feature to kick back to and take in.","

Having been to small towns and villages I have experienced how locals can adopt you after a few days and how you will do anything for them. May not be the typical American Equalizer but great cultural integration. If you love travelling and integrating with different people then this will appeal to you.I know fans of the earlier two films will want to see more planning and action but the point of the film is that he has finally found where he belongs. Yes there is a leap of faith at the beginning from several characters to trust him but it still works. Dakota Fanning was also a good addition.","

But this time, he has decided to retire and settle in Southern Italy, enjoy a peaceful life, and make some local friends. Of course, as you would expect in an Equalizer movie, it doesn't stay quiet for long, and McCall discovers that his new friends are under the control of local crime bosses - and he wants to protect them.The Equalizer 3 gets off to a slow start, but by the second half of the movie, things pick up. Of course, the plot is predictable, and there is nothing original about it. The action scenes are well choreographed and intense, contrasting with the beautiful Southern Italy backdrop to what is going on.As usual, the tone of the movie is gritty, with rare moments of humour. Denzel Washington puts in a solid performance as Robert McCall. The rest of the cast is forgettable. The story superficially skates across themes of redemption, justice, and family. There's nothing new. I enjoyed the soundtrack, but it's standard stuff for an action movie. The dialogue is ok but doesn't have any memorable lines.I was entertained by Equalizer 3, but there's nothing much to be emotionally invested in, and it is a by-the-numbers action movie with lots of explicit violence. The theme of community and family probably resonated with me the most.If you are looking for an action movie to pass the time, particularly if you have seen the other two Equalizer movies, I'd check this out. But don't expect a groundbreaking film with original ideas. Take plenty of popcorn!","

"The Equalizer 3","thesar-2","7 September 2023","This Sorta-Senior-Bourne does not Equate the greatness of the first two and yet, still gets a solid recommendation. Only, catch it on streaming.While I really did have a good time here and cherished the baddies getting 10x more than they deserved, this is definitely a SKIP-theatres kind of movie. On the surface, it looks like it would have grand cinematography, but it really doesn't. They truly made an interesting and picturesque Italian village look dull and boring.""Retired"" Superspy Roberto McCall finally feels some of the pain he dishes out when he gets wounded during one of his many vigilante adventures. In about half the movie's time, he heals in a foreign land, gets warmly welcomed and has enough encounters with the local thugs, his mouth waters once more for vengeance.One thing that ultimately let me down was the lack of episodic ""heroism"" scenes. This was based on the weekly television action-drama of the 80s about an ex-CIA agent stealthy helping the needy and punishing the criminals. One thing they did great in both parts 1 and 2 was making you feel like you've seen a half-season worth of episodes/climaxes within the runtime. This was sadly absent in the supposed ""final chapter.""Instead, this boiled down to just two linked Italian Jobs. And for the majority of the movie, he's the ""getting too old for this stuff"" recovering patient. Most of this action movie is just as slow as the first chapter and while I did like the world-building/character-developing, I would have loved to see him more able than disabled. Plus, the story had all the beats you needed, they just weren't all felt.And yet...I did have fun. The small sparks of the old Robert McCall were really nice. I mean, Denzel Washington. The name says it. Even in his worst movies, he shines. And he still charmed me to death.I do love how consistent this franchise is. Yes, this was the weakest entry, but still dang enjoyable. Plus, I love how HARD-R this is. In the few kill-moments, Robert doesn't mess around. SOOO glad this wasn't PG13.Overall, if you liked the first two, there isn't a reason to not make this a trilogy night. And if you're worried about this going on too long, keep in mind: mercifully, each installment gets shorter and shorter.Listen up Hollywood, PLEASE make shorter movies. I really can't bare to go into another 3-hour movie, especially ones you already told us was just the first part of two. Egah, too long!***Final Thoughts: Not that long of a franchise, even though it's been going on for about a decade now, but here's my ranking:1. The Equalizer (2014) 4/5 Stars - Barely edges out #2, almost a tie.2. The Equalizer 2 (2018) 4/5 Stars.3. The Equalizer (2023) 3½/5 Stars.","

This movie also shows us the beauty of Italy and the Italian culture.Denzel Washingtons acting is superb. The way he acts by his face expressions,With his body language,by his looks and With his words is awesome to watch. Antoine Fuqua is a very talented director and in my opinion he has created a masterpiece.Fuqua directed both the Equalizer and the Equalizer 2 in an excellent way. All the Equalizer movies has different stories and maybee this is the most beutiful story of the three movies.The Equalizer 3 Its a great story who is getting personal for the wiewer and the message is:we can all contribute to do this world a better place.The filming is so good that it feels like you are two steps behind Mc Call and can follow every step he takes during the whole movie.Great acting also from Dakota Fanning and Remo Girone and from many others of the actors in this movie.Robert McCall is personifying a person who is doing this world a better place to be in and what we can learn from this movie is that we all can contribute to do this world a better place to be in.In this movie we get to know Robert McCalls human side more. We can feel how he like all human beeings are facing situations every day where he can choose to help others and then reap the joy to see others rejoice.Excellent movie who deserves to be watched many times!I hope that Robert McCall Will be back in Equalizer 4
This franchise is even better than the James Bond franchise and the world gets a better place for every The Equalizer movie that is released.Martin Berger (Prague Czech Republic)","

"The Equalizer 3","olcare","10 October 2023","Denzel Washington makes it feel like he was born for this role, even elevating a simple movie.The film is primarily straightforward, easy to understand, and doesn't promise an exceptional script, but it does tie the series together well and doesn't diminish the entertainment.Of course, there are clichés, whether it's the peaceful town or the mafia, they're all clichés, but what stuck in my mind in the end wasn't the clichés.One of the simplest reasons I'd give this movie a 7 is the makeup. The makeup for the deceased and the CGI in the explosion scene was unexpectedly good; I genuinely applaud the entire team for this aspect.What I really wished for was a more complex storyline, a story that would grip us more, but I didn't feel too bad about how it ended. Thank you, Denzel, for being here.","

"The Equalizer 3","marcet","12 December 2023","A film made for an American audience that knows nothing about Italy.A far-fetched plot set in a fake country that is supposed to represent Italy and caricatures of characters that have nothing realistic. Almost 2 hours of platitudes and clichés that ruined the memory of a good movie that was Equalizer 1. Too bad. And a pity for a great actor like Denzel Washington, forced to play the worn and sad roles of a once vigorous character. The scene of the bad guy who had let the police chief enter his villa and cut off his hand and then was afraid to be photographed in the square and therefore did not shoot the protagonist was ridiculous.","

"The Equalizer 3","trharwood","10 September 2023","First time I've walked out of a cinema. The violence should have been given a higher rating, 18+ at least.I've watched (and enjoyed) plenty of violent action movies (e.g. John Wick) but this was gratuitous and unnecessary.Loved the first 2 Equalizer movies, but they've obviously run out of ideas and tried to make up for it with attempted shock value.First scene is just long lingering shots of dead bodies killed in creative ways. It didn't even build tension and it ended predictably. Maybe the director was dating one of the makeup artists and wanted to show off their work?!Waste of time and money.","

"The Equalizer 3","ykjdh","1 September 2023","Years after the events of the past two movies Robert McCall is living the life in Italy. This is where retired government assassin people go when they get old. At first, I was not a fan of one my favorite tv shows reimagined to an American character. I watched the prior two films before seeing this at an advanced screening. Only Denzel can turn what is essential a B movie action flick into a first rate thriller.This third movie brings humanity to the deadly enforcer and it gives the film a heart. Had there not been any films before this one, it could stand alone as it's own film. There's a very much deadly enforcer in this one who didn't get the memo about McCall so he simply doesn't care because he's just as badass.Action movie lovers will get their money's worth here as well as Denzel Washington fans of his ""thinking"" action hero.","

"The Equalizer 3","rehmankhilji","14 October 2023","The first installment was simply beautiful, and the second lived up to the same standard. However, this latest one-come on, it felt like they were pushing it onto the audience.Denzel, well, he does make it look super cool and extra entertaining, but this one doesn't quite reach the level set by the first two editions.This is the reason for a bit of disappointment; you start watching with very high expectations, solely because of the brilliance of the first two parts. However, as you progress, you find that it doesn't quite measure up to the same standard. While the concept of taking the fight abroad was good, the plot, its presentation, and the failure to maintain the character tidiness while executing the action are among the reasons for my disappointment.Nevertheless, if you've seen the first two, it's worth watching the third, especially for Denzel.","

"The Equalizer 3","karthierocks","3 September 2023","I was really excited to see Denzel back in action and went to watch in theatres the first day itself but honestly it was bad. It had the nuance and potential to be a great concluding chapter in the Equalizer series but it didn't do the character any justice. Somewhere along the way, the director, Antoine Fuqua lost the charm of how he made the first Equalizer great: with riveting and inventive action that keeps you glued to the screen. This movie doesn't have that. The opening act was cool but after that, the movie goes stale and bland for a long time until the end of the second half but even the climax of the movie wasn't properly done. You can easily predict what would happen in the movie pretty easily and if you have watched the trailer, there's actually nothing more to be seen cause they have included all the good portions of the movie in the trailer. Thankfully I didn't watch the trailer and so atleast, that was an advantage for me but even then, the movie is simply put: boring. I've even liked the second movie but this one is really bad! It felt like the movie didn't have a proper script and they just wanted to release a movie just to say that they've completed a trilogy!","

It may not be quite as violent as the first two in the series. It may not equal the first, but it surpasses the second.I don't think the Dakota Fanning character is fleshed out enough, and the Federal Government NEVER moves this fast. It's she's so underutilized.The remaining support characters were all played so very well. The villagers represented a real idyllic community in Sicily.There's not a lot fault with the movie. There's probably too many subtitles.Denzel Washington is as always tremendous.","

I was worried from some of the other reviews that it would not be as good as the other ones.But I loved it
You can watch it as a one off or as a series which the other two
Denzel is an amazing actor and Dakota fanning did a great job. I love the character of Robert he is cool
As with the other two it has a great background story and people you genuinely care about. The violence although gorey feel appropriate and not too far fetched like some films
I was completely involved in the film and even rewound some scenes to make sure I'd seen things right.","

"The Equalizer 3","eddie_baggins","31 August 2023","Does the third entry in the Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington Equalizer series do anything you wouldn't expect or give you anything you wouldn't wish to receive? Absolutely not, but that's entirely the point in a surprisingly solid third outing for Washington's Robert McCall as he finds himself on a not so relaxing holiday to Italy.A much more entertaining and well-rounded outing than the trite second chapter that seemed to suggest McCall should stay retired for good, Equalizer 3 is the biggest step yet into exploitation territory, marked by a grisly opening act and a procession of gory yet also cartoonish violence that sees both Fuqua and Washington revel in the excesses of their over the top story that hides nothing about its true identity and wears it like a brand new hat from a clothing store.There's no doubt a film of this ilk is below someone as talented as Washington but it's also a guilty pleasure joy to see such a talented performer embrace such a simplistic yet uncomplicated outing that does what it says it will on the box and does it well and while Washington may here be teaming up with his Man on Fire partner Dakota Fanning as upstart government agent Emma Collins, this is very much the Washington show and a show he commands with a simply facial expression or a gun through the eye.Moving the McCall action from the United States to Italy is also a strong move for Fuqua's film with the seaside set locale in Southern Italy allowing for a lot of solid moments of eye candy around the cheese-riddled dialogue, the questionable friendship/romance arcs and side plots about kindly fisherman and while there may be less action than some might expect from a film brandished with the Equalizer name, when McCall gets going he makes it worth your time, gleefully dispatching Bond like baddies as if his a blood relative of John Wick, ensuring fans will be satiated with the carnage they are given.Unlikely to win any new fans, this old school action/thriller that feels like a product of a bygone era is a competent and effective genre offering that is unashamed of what it is and at all times aware of what it isn't, giving us an entertaining ""final"" chapter to the exploits of one of Washington's most over the top yet memorable characters.Final Say -A refreshingly old school action flick that's journey into exploitation cinema may surprise fans of the first two outings, The Equalizer 3 doesn't have a lot of depth or meat on its bones but thanks to a commanding Washington, a great location and some intense action, The Equalizer 3 is sure to appease.3 1/2 ice buckets out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"The Equalizer 3","leevi-pettersson","9 September 2023","Considering that the two previous installments had been quite good ones(especially the first one), I had pretty high expectations for the movie. Unfortunately after watching it, I found myself feeling like I had been one of the bad guys in this movie, but with less gore.One has to wonder that if Fuque and Denzel were spending good time on the beautiful coast and decided that they might as well do a movie? So shallow and thoughtless it feels sometimes that even the fish in the movie might have problems swimming.One of the biggest issues of the film are relationships which Robert/o creates. When compared to the previous films, I found myself caring much less what happens to the people involved. For example in the first movie there was a lot of story arch for the young female character and you really felt it. Also it was clear to see how much Robert was struggling with his conscience. In this movie he appeared almost sadistic sometimes. In the second movie the character bonds were much stronger and the people were interesting. These ""civilians"" and criminals were way more one dimensional.As some of the previous reviewers have pointed out, we are starting to stretch the limits of imagination way too much. Obviously Robert has always been more or less fantasy character but this time we are taking things up to the notch. Also multiple scenes in the movie are not realistic at all or something what would really happen in the current criminal world. After all, this does not happen in Mexico or some parts of Africa or during the last century.The slow tempo did not really bother me and I liked Roberto having a plenty of cups of tea. Cinematography is the clear winner of the movie and Italy looks stunning, so much so that the country could consider hiring Antoine as a creator of travel ads. Music is quite good too but it makes me wonder what Harry could have achieved with this one.The film serie is known for it brutal action sequences but for those people who expect more of that, may feel like they have been gut punched by Roberto because after all, there is very little action and it's rather boring when compared to the previous films of the trilogy. The final action part is very disappointing and it almost feels like all the wine bottles were put into the basket of the beginning scene.I have been pondering between 5 and 6 but since we can't give half points, I have to rise it to 6 and there are indeed some redeeming qualities like the beautiful cinematography. But for those who are after more realism and depth in their dishes, this smells like an ""expired"" fish. So stick with the previous titles, you get more soul and some.","

"The Equalizer 3","arsalanweb","7 October 2023","The Equalizer 3 is an action-packed thriller that delivers on many fronts, earning a solid 7 stars out of 10. While the movie had its moments of excitement and intrigue, it did fall short in a couple of key areas, hence the slightly lower rating.Let's start with the positives. Denzel Washington once again shines in his role as Robert McCall, the enigmatic vigilante with a heart of gold. His performance is nothing short of stellar, and his portrayal of McCall's unwavering dedication to justice is a true highlight of the film. The action sequences, when they do occur, are intense and well-executed, showcasing McCall's lethal skills and resourcefulness.The storyline, though not groundbreaking, keeps you engaged throughout, as McCall embarks on another mission to right the wrongs of the world. The supporting cast also delivers commendable performances, adding depth to the characters and the overall narrative.However, where The Equalizer 3 falls short is in the absence of those iconic slow-motion scenes that have become synonymous with the franchise. These moments added a unique flair to the previous films, and their absence is certainly felt. Additionally, the film's pacing was a bit slow at times, causing certain scenes to drag on longer than necessary. Tightening up the editing and injecting more adrenaline-pumping action could have improved the overall viewing experience.In conclusion, The Equalizer 3 is a solid addition to the franchise, with Denzel Washington's magnetic presence and a compelling storyline. While it may not reach the heights of its predecessors due to the missing iconic slow-motion scenes and occasional pacing issues, it still delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant a 7-star rating. Fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this latest installment, and it's worth a watch for anyone seeking an action-packed evening at the movies.","

"The Equalizer 3","TMAuthor23","9 September 2023","Denzel Washington is one of those actors who raises a movie's quality and value just by being in it.Coincidentally, John Wick also walked off into the sunset not long ago. The characters share some DNA, but their worlds are entirely different. One borders on fantasy, this one tries to stay grounded in the real world.The setup is very long, with the script used to justify McCall's deep connection and commitment to the people of the small Italian village that has adopted him. The extra time spent on the brutality and arrogance of the Italian mafia boss is unnecessary, other than to create a desire to see him pay for his deeds.Dakota Fanning, paired with Washington for the first time since they preformed together in Man On Fire, provides a capable performance. The question that the plot made me think about though was this: as experienced and clued in as McCall clearly is, why doesn't he recognize the danger he attracts to people he is interested in when he starts waging a vigilante war? It's a plot point that creates some disconnects with his aggrieved portrayal. He creates the battle that he says he doesn't want to fight. Or maybe he does want the battle, so he can completely remove the violent threat to his New Haven.Equalizer 3 has a tenuous hold on reality, because, as happens with most action movies, the action sequences sometimes stretch the laws of physics. And for me, I find it very disturbing when a child is threatened in a script. For any reason.But ultimately, because Denzel Washington is an exceptional actor, and his character has significant backstory that we've seen in earlier films, Equalizer 3 wraps up the series in satisfactory fashion. The action is kinetic, Denzel provides the gravitas, and the story concludes with a definitive end point for McCall. A few threads from the original film are tied up too.As with most series like this, the original is the best. But a good actor is like a tide that that floats all boats.Recommended.","

"The Equalizer 3","CinemaSerf","31 August 2023","Anyone remember the little tune that went with the Edward Woodward television series? Well you won't hear it here in this rather procedural vehicle for Denzel Washington. His usually meticulous planning is compromised by a young lad with a rifle. This leaves ""McCall"" needing the care of a doctor ""Enzo"" (Remo Girone) in a small Sicilian town that is about to become the centre of the venal ambitions of ""Vincent"" (Andrea Scarduzio) and his henchman younger brother ""Marco"" (Andrea Dodero) who uses his team of thugs to extort from the local businesses. It's only a matter of time before heads clash and, well - you can guess the rest of this actually rather brutally predictable drama. Dakota Fanning appears now and again in a rather unnecessary sub-plot involving the CIA and some Syrian narcotics smugglers that is really undercooked - but for the most part this is really just Denzel being, well, Denzel on his quest to save his new-found friends from the grip of the unscrupulous Camorra. It's overlong for what it is, and I found Washington's performance to be rather sluggish throughout before a denouement that came across as rather simplistically rushed. It's fine, but forgettable.","

Antoine Fuqua, for they both have struck gold with this, the final installment of their spellbinding and riveting series based upon the television series in the mid-eighties of the same name. And, without giving anything away, you will learn Robert McCall connects back with some of his past adventures from their previous movies, and does so in ways that reflect the lead characters unwavering principles and make him even that much more a doer of good.Bravo.","

"The Equalizer 3","akcenat","2 December 2023","The latest 'Equalizer' is the third installment of the action thriller franchise starring Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, a former CIA agent who uses his skills to help people in need. However, this time, the movie fails to deliver the same level of excitement and suspense as the previous ones. The script is terrible, full of clichés, plot holes, and inconsistencies. The plot is unbelievable and unrealistic. The action scenes are over-the-top and lack logic, making the movie more suitable for a cheaper production of B movies. The only saving grace of the movie is Washington's performance, which is still charismatic and convincing, but not enough to save the movie from being a disappointment. Equalizer 3 is a letdown for the fans of the franchise and a waste of time for the viewers who expect a quality action thriller. I give it a 6.25 out of 10.","

Fanning and DW have a good screen chemistry after all these years since she was a child actress. Her role is really rather small, but adds a nice personal touch to the story, and their brief screen time is well done.Beautiful scenery, some brutal action, and a concise plot make for a very watchable action flick. I see quite a few reviews here saying the movie is boring. I don't get it. I was thoroughly entertained. Nothing is overly drawn out here. In fact, imo I would have liked to have spent more time in this beautiful Italian town getting to know the denizens a bit better.The opening sequence to the movie is excellent and sets up the plot. Denzel does his thing with a satisfy offing of the baddies and make the life of the good people better. It is everything you want from an Equalizer movie.","

"The Equalizer 3","talllwoood13","21 November 2023","Without subtitles good luck watching this and keeping up with the story. Granted it's not the toughest to follow plot in the world and they are in Italy so it makes sense but either way that was one huge complaint I had with this.Like the other movies the first scene sets a tone for what is to come. I love the human shield he does in the beginning of the film to shoot the last bad guy.I hated the location in this film. Italy I've been told is a beautiful place but this particular location It comes off as the most claustrophobic town in Italy. Nothing but narrow roads between buildings in an over populated little town where it feels weird to see people driving around in cars there. The only thing worst than this would be riding a subway in Tokyo during rush hour. The town is like a hot woman with really bad body odor. From far a perfect 10 but the closer you get to her. In this case closer to the town the more closer she'll etch towards a 1/10 because of how close everything is together. I'm sure 5 houses down could hear the toilet flush.How Denzel gets into the town and everything makes sense. The plot is over done but at least it didn't end the way certain other movies end where the whole town finally has enough and takes out the bad guy in the end. No it's not one of those.The CIA angle worked. However I struggled for the most part with this one for it to keep me interested. Even when they revealed the how and why he went to the first location in the beginning of the building I still didn't really care. I'm just glad Robert didn't fall in love with the only African looking woman in town if so I'd be insulted.I kind of hope this is the last Equalizer as I don't think anything else they get Robert to do would even be remotely interesting after this.","

"The Equalizer 3","jboothmillard","12 September 2023","It all started with the TV show starring Edward Woodward, then came the movie adaptation, which was alright, the sequel was pretty much the same standard, this third instalment was supposedly the conclusion to the trilogy, directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen, The Magnificent Seven). Basically, after arriving at a secluded winery in Sicily, criminal Lorenzo Vitale (Bruno Bilotta) slowly makes his way through the building, where he finds several henchmen have been brutally killed. When he finally enters the basement, he finds former Marine and Defense Intelligence Agency spy Robert McCall (Denzel Washington), being held at gunpoint by two of Vitale's bodyguards. McCall gives him the chance to leave alive, but Vitale tries to kill him, so McCall kills him and the rest of the gangsters. After walking out, he obtains a key to a vault at the winery and takes a bag full of stolen money from a cyber heist. While walking out into the courtyard, McCall is shot in the back by Vitale's adolescent Grandson (Adriano Sabrie). McCall considers suicide due to his injury but changes his mind and takes a ferry to the mainland. While driving on the Amalfi Coast, he pulls over, unconscious from shock, and is found and rescued by local carabiniere Gio Bonucci (Eugenio Mastrandrea). Bonucci brings him the remote coastal Italian town of Altamonte, where he is treated by small-town doctor Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone). McCall makes a slow recovery, walking with a cane and struggling to use the stairs. He forms friendships with the locals, including waitress Aminah (Gaia Scodellaro), and becomes fond of the town and its people. McCall makes an anonymous phone call to CIA officer Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning) to tip her off about the illegal drug trade disguised as business transaction that was taking place at the winery in Sicily. McCall's suspicions are confirmed when Collins and other CIA operatives find millions in cash along with bags of Captagon tablets hidden in a storeroom. McCall recognises he is being tracked when Collins appears, but he does not give clear answers when asked about his identity. Meanwhile, members of the Italian Mafia-type criminal organisation the Camorra harass and kill villagers trying to coerce them out of their houses and take over Altamonte for commercialisation purposes. McCall overhears high-ranking Camorra member Marco Quaranta (Andrea Dodero) pressuring local seafood storeowner Angelo (Daniele Perrone) to pay money he owes. As punishment and warning, Angelo's fish store is firebombed by the Camorra with the entire town helplessly watching. Bonucci watches a video of the firebombing and with Italian central police tries to track a van involved. Bonucci, his wife Chiara (Sonia Ben Ammar) and his daughter Gabriella (Dea Lanzaro) are attacked by the Camorra and beaten for interfering in their operations. Later, Marco and other gangsters demand that Bonucci set up a boat for them. McCall overhears this and requests them to move their operations to a different location. When Marco refuses, he kills him and his henchmen. The Naples head of police is threatened and tortured by Marco's brother Vincent (Andrea Scarduzio) to find who killed him. Collins' car rigged with a bomb by Vincent, but she escapes after McCall warns her. Vincent later threatens to shoot Bonucci in front of the entire town if McCall doesn't reveal himself. McCall walks out from the shadows, but before Vincent can kill him, the several of the townspeople record the ordeal on their camera phones. Vincent and the rest of the Camorra retreat but plan to return the following day. Later that night, McCall kills Vincent and his many bodyguards. The stolen money is returned to an elderly couple, their pension fund, by Collins on behalf of McCall. Back in Langley, Virginia, Collins receives a promotion for her role in ending the Altamonte drug trade. It is revealed she is the daughter of McCall's late handler Susan Plummer and her husband Brian. With the Quaranta brothers dead and all threats to the town eliminated, McCall is finally able to relax and celebrates a football tournament victory with the townspeople. Also starring David Denman as Frank Conroy, Salvatore Ruocco as Vincent's Man, and Alessandro Pess as Viking. Washington is well cast as the retired skilled agent and silently aggressive good Samaritan, and it is good to see him reunited with Man on Fire co-star Fanning, now grown-up and being reasonable as the CIA agent keeping tabs on him. It is the same basic formula; the lead anti-hero observes nasty men doing things to the innocent friends he has made and uses his ""particular set of skills"" to get rid of them, the fights and violence are good, otherwise it is just a standard slick enough action thriller. Worth watching!","

"The Equalizer 3","searchanddestroy-1","6 December 2023","Of course EQUALIZER franchise belongs to the bad ass films genre, as those starring Steven Seagal, JCVD, Jason Statham and a couple of other not real actors for me. Except that, concerning EQUALIZER, Denzel Washington is a true authentic and talented actor who won the Academy Awards for TRAINING DAY, from the same director for whom he is his fetish actor; I mean Antoine Fuqua. The latest made this one, the third of the franchise. I am not usually fan of this kind of actionner where the lead always wins, is nearly never wounded or even ""touched"", never the slightest scratch. But I dont know why, I LOVE the EQUALIZER series, mainly because of Denzel who, as I just said before, can perfectly do far far better, totally different kind of characters - unlike JCVD, Seagal and Statham !!!! And the peculiarity of this franchise is that the stories are different in the plots, atmospheres. For instance the first involved the Russian mafia with an army of thugs, delightful villains, and a terrific body count; the second film was something different: only three or four bad guys, bad guys where one of them was a good family man for whom we could feel empathy.... Here, there is again new elements and another kind of story telling. The lead character - Washington - remains faithful to his role, so swindle for the audience, and the excitement is the same, with maybe less action scenes than usual, except the opening and last part of the feature. The Equalizer is better here than usual for my taste. I told you, this one doesn't look like the previous two, which were already not the same one to the other. I hope the franchise will proceed. My favourite scenes in any EQUALIZER film are Denzel Washington watching his timer for the ten seconds countdown, just before showing his skills.....JUST GREAT !!!!!","

"The Equalizer 3","TomTalksFilms","2 October 2023","5 years since the last film in the equaliser franchise and Denzel Washington is back as Robert McCall. For anyone not in the know Robert McCall is a bit like a John Kramer character who deals out justice to those who may have continued to get away with their actions otherwise. Unlike Kramers use of traps though McCall prefers a good old fashioned shotgun, Sniper or pistol, you get the idea. This time around he finds himself in a small town in Southern Italy being attended to by a doctor after taking a bullet to the back in the films prologue. He begins to get used to the fine things Italy is known for such as their food, hospitality and oh yeah drug smuggling gangs.Just as he starts to feel like he's found the perfect place to retire his break is interrupted by a gang called the Camorra who without going into spoiler territory essentially plan to take the town for themselves.It feels somewhat unfair to compare this film to the likes of John Wick Chapter 4 as yes of course they would both fit into the same genre as they're both action films. That being said however it's a bit like comparing CS:GO with Call Of Duty, yes they're in the same genre, they're both online multiplayer first person shooters but at the same time they're very different. This film is very much like the CS:GO to John Wicks Call Of Duty. Robert McCall is much more methodical and spends more time planning than taking action this does mean that there's overall less action in this film compared to say the likes of John Wick. I don't think that's a bad thing though as what action there is in the film is impactful and I have to say a lot bloodier than I had anticipated it being. The trade we get with less action scenes is an all together much more grounded story. We see the damage this gang is causing to the people of this tight nit community and as the audience we are fully onboard and are just waiting for McCall to strike. That being said it does also mean that this isn't an action film for all fans of the genre it's a much more realistic story and sets itself and the franchise away from the likes of the John Wick films.Overall this was an enjoyable way to spend a late Monday afternoon and it's great to see Denzel Washington back where he belongs on the big screen after a short hiatus.Rating: 7/10.","

The people of this small town help him and welcome him among them and he's happy to return the favour.","

"The Equalizer 3","DeathbyExile","6 September 2023","First thing about this movie: this movie is incredibly shot. We get a GOOD look at Italy and we feel like we are a part of this city. It's extremely well done.The second thing about this movie: Denzel is amazing. The director - Antoine Fuqua (previously in Training Day) is reunited to make this masterpiece. This movie is very character-driven, so anyone watching this will UNDERSTAND why Robert McCall is such a beloved character.I took off a star because of the pacing issues. It's a little slow at times, but it's clear they wanted more story than action. The characters are good. The actors did a great job in making you like or hate them.There's a quote that I'm paraphrasing here, but the idea is there. A good man doesn't know if they are a good or bad person.","

"The Equalizer 3","lavatch","4 January 2024","There is a special moment in ""The Equalizer 3"" when Robert McCall addresses a thug in a restaurant, emphasizing how ""timing"" was so important in bringing them together. And the point he was stressing was how unfortunate the timing was for the thug!No actor could possibly play McCall with the swagger of Denzel Washington, which makes watching this movie so enjoyable. It is especially his concern for the downtrodden of the world that is both touching and engaging.This episode is set in the idyllic Sicilian town of Altomonte in Sicily. It is there that McCall becomes attached to the locals, such as the kind Dr. Enzo Arisio, who nurses him back to health after being shot in the back. There is even a slight romantic intrigue when a restaurant proprietor takes an interest in McCall when she admires his hat!Another good character development was Collins, the CIA agent who at first is skeptical about McCall who becomes ""a person of interest"" and later ""an interesting person.""Everyone is hoping for a fourth installment of the compulsively watchable Equalizer.","

"The Equalizer 3","ShadeKnight","16 November 2023","The plot seems like it was taken from a 4-year-old and expanded upon - poorly.Every action in the film felt unjustified, unbelievable, and underwhelming.Character development was sub-par, taking the reasonable yet haunted character from the first two films and making him an untenable sociopath, at times irreconcilable with himself in the same film. Everyone else in the film was a cardboard cut out, even the love interest that goes nowhere and merely serves as a) eye candy, and b) someone the main character can be ""empathetic"" with to offset his apparent psychosis, thereby giving the audience a slim thread of likability to hang on to.The action was mediocre at best. The ""let's all stick together"", syrupy-sweet relationships that develop are hackneyed and implausible.I don't fault Mr. Washington for this tripe, he's an excellent actor. It genuinely feels as if the writers threw this together in a couple of weeks, high on adrenaline and whatever else, and genuinely thought it was passable. It wasn't.Truthfully, I've never been a fan of Mr. Fuqua, except for a couple of his films. Just about everything he's done has attempted to be grandiose and elevating and merely gets to ""meh"" on the meter.Anyway, watch the film. If you like it because coastal Italy seems exotic to you, great. But don't be afraid to come to terms with disliking it within the first 45 minutes and turning it off.","

"The Equalizer 3","jp_91","17 October 2023","""The Equalizer 3"" is a good action film that moves away from the falsehood of many films of this genre that have been released during the last two decades, in which characters perform physically impossible acts, scenes with flying cars and illogical decisions of its characters who remain unscathed in any implausible situation. In ""The Equalizer 3"" the action scenes are taken realistically and are not exaggerated in their execution, in addition to giving explicit gore scenes done in the old school style. A great success of the film is its cinematography, which is perfectly done and results in a visual delight in camera movements and lighting work, in addition to exploiting the beautiful filming locations. The script tells a story that is not so original but that manages to connect with the viewer. The performances are good, with the always incredible Denzel Washington standing out.

Washington does indeed heal both body & mind but surprisingly his spirit as well as he takes to the small hamlet as his own especially when the Mafia starts to make moves on his new neighbors forcing his hand to strike back. Washington & Fuqua have I assume after making 5 films together (Training Day & the Magnificent Seven remake round our their collection) have established an easy shorthand together w/each artist complimenting each other which puts the viewer in a relaxed frame of mind in what they're about to watch w/be something special w/this outing (which I hope is not their last) as good as their others.

"The Equalizer 3","doyler79","4 September 2023","In the cinematic world of ""The Equalizer 3,"" Denzel Washington reprises his indelible role as Robert McCall, reviving a character that bears the distinct aura of a modern-day Western hero. As the narrative unfurls, it becomes evident that McCall, portrayed with a magnetic and enigmatic presence by Washington, encapsulates the quintessential spirit of a lone gunslinger embarking on an odyssey of justice.The film's journey commences with a narrative template well-worn but remarkably rejuvenated by Washington's performance. McCall's character, cloaked in a shroud of mystery and resolute determination, evokes the timeless archetype of a solitary figure traversing an unforgiving landscape.The cinematic experience is punctuated by action sequences that, while occasionally stretching the bounds of reality, serve as a poignant homage to the classic Western showdowns of yesteryears. These moments magnificently showcase McCall's astute resourcefulness, contrasting his unique brand of vigilante justice with the ruthless tactics of his adversaries. Denzel Washington, in these electrifying encounters, reasserts his status as one of Hollywood's most captivating talents.""The Equalizer 3"" transcends mere action spectacle, delving into a labyrinthine narrative featuring the CIA, ISIS, and the Camorra. This intricate tapestry weaves together elements of espionage, terrorism, and organized crime, lending the plot an enthralling complexity. The introduction of Dakota Fanning's character as a CIA agent introduces a captivating dynamic, albeit one that could have benefited from further character depth and development.Under the masterful direction of Antoine Fuqua, the film's visuals seamlessly capture the picturesque Italian backdrop, invoking an aura akin to a modern-day frontier. The visual palette oscillates gracefully between tranquil townscapes and explosive showdowns in the dust-laden streets.Though minor tonal inconsistencies occasionally mar the film's coherence, ""The Equalizer 3"" ultimately emerges as a gripping and action-packed odyssey that adeptly channels the essence of a modern Western. Denzel Washington's enduring charisma and his arresting portrayal of McCall constitute the nucleus of this cinematic tour de force.In summation, ""The Equalizer 3"" delivers a cinematic symphony, splendidly resonating with the spirit of a contemporary Western saga. With its relentless action sequences and the charismatic resurgence of Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, it earns a commendable 8/10 rating. This film secures its place within the annals of modern action cinema while also reaffirming its lead actor's magnetic hold on the silver screen.","

Some of them were really violent, threatening small time thugs that enjoyed torturing innocent and defenceless people, this is the setting for our hero to settle some scores. The story only made sense at the end so you have to be patient.A few things irritated, the subtitles it was practically an all Italian movie.Slowly but surely the tension built and hero delivered in spades, the camerawork was inspired as were the medieval settings, apart from the Mafiosa types lol, I want to get on a plane tomorrow and visit this beautiful place.Overall this was a really great movie and Densiel was inspired.

"The Equalizer 3","Cinephilos","13 October 2023","All three Equalizer movies make the audience not only hate the villains but also the villains' culture and nation. In Equalizer 1, the Russian mafia and Russians in general are described as evil. It's difficult to distinguish the villains from their cultures. The Russian mafia regional boss who dies on the funky floor disdains the entire American people by saying ""You Americans think you can buy whatever you want."" In Equalizer 2, there is even less sympathy for the Turkish father who abducts his daughter from his ex-wife only to hurt her. The audience gets the feeling that not only this Turkish man but also his entire culture is complicit in this crime because the Turkish culture is mysogynistic and patriarchical. About Denzel's African-American sidekick painter, one can't decide whether to root for him or to give up on the African-American male culture which drives men to crime. As for Equalizer 3, I got the feeling that Italy is so powerless about the organized crime that the innocent peace-loving people and the police must all bow before the omnipotent Camorrah. Although the audience roots for the good Italians, it also learns to fear the loss of government control over crime in Italy. The only good guys are the CIA, which is a strange way of looking at the world.","

It probably wouldn't even make sense at this (st)age to let him fight every goddamn Mafioso in Sicily.Yes, it's a bit underwhelming in case of fight scenes as e.g. The scenery starts with lots and lots of dead bodies and you don't really know why and wonder how it all started, but Fuqua wants to put Denzel aka McCall in the spot: his heart, his characteristics, his wisdom, but also the heaviness of his heart because of his transgressions.That's it, that's the film you get, a character study in a action trilogy that even though it feels a bit too shiny (for Fuqua typical unfortunately), it definitely has the heart in the right place. And I appreciate that a lot from a flick, where everyone expects only action and violence.","

Heck, I didn't even watch the entire movie. I got to around 2/3 and then picked up my phone and whatever. Since the movie no longer interested me, I was half-watching it until the end.This movie was SO BORING. I see other reviews telling us that the scenery was beautiful, and that's because there is no action or anything else to watch. They show us Denzel walking down stairs with a cane, Denzel drinking tea, and Denzel going up the stairs with his cane. Most movies wouldn't show us the entire journey up and down the stairs, but this one does.There was so very little action, that it shouldn't have been called an Equalizer movie, but something else. It was like a bait and switch. I'm not even sure what the heck is was about. The intro was good, and I got excited because it was Denzel killing bad guy butt, but then it was just the camera following him around like he was on vacation, and it was boring as hell.I tried watching this a couple months ago, and I got bored and did something else. I tried again tonight and the same thing happened.Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie. That bogus Equalizer TV series with Queen Latifh is a joke as well. She is a great actress, but she can't pull off that role. So many cuts during her fight scenes that you could fall into an epileptic seizure. Plus that kid of hers is annoying as hell, and having a kid on this type of show is just silly.","

Considering the long tradition of spaghetti westerns, Italy is a comfortable place for our good versus evil shootouts.This third and presumably last installment of its franchise, The Equalizer 3 has much less of a body count than, say, in John Wicke, but far more heart and soul as it zeroes in on the masterfully understated expressions of the Oscar-winning star. While the Wicke franchise offers bloody ballet, Equalizer McCall offers terse no nonsense: ""Nine seconds. That's what I'll give you to decide your fate.""Why this retired government assassin lands here is uncertain, but it is certain that while he grows loving toward the town, he is equally appalled by the Camorra mafia's blatant drug smuggling and abuse of the townspeople. He will have none of that.In a series of bloody set pieces, especially the painful ""arm wrestling"" encounter, Robert begins to set things straight. Helped by the luscious cinematography of Tarantino's lenser, Robert Richardson, with the pure white town spotted in red, director Antoine Fuqua and screenwriter Richard Wenk capture the beautiful vulnerability of a former medieval fishing town confronting the messy brutality of modernity.Like most others in the audience, I know what is coming to the bad guys as this improbable savior whitewashes the bloody town to make it pure again. Because this is allegedly Washington's swan song as Robert McCall, we watch more intently the professional assassin of The Equalizer 3 put to order the other not so smart assassins.My delight is the comfort that comes from seeing the bad guys get what they deserve because they are getting away with murder of various kinds in our real world.","

"The Equalizer 3","statuskuo","11 September 2023","This is a movie that just feels like they were painting by the numbers. If you enjoy the cookie cutter action flick, it's not bad. The template is a western. A solitary man (with some affliction) shows his ability of force. He come to a town that is suffering under corruption. He is pushed to the limits until he fights back for the townspeople.Yep. It's that basic. Again, if this template plays to your heart, this is worth a watch.I would also say, seeing Dakota Fanning, previous of ""Man On Fire"" with Denzel was a bit jarring. That might've been the selling point, but she is as believable as a operative as Jason Statham would be as a mild mannered reporter in a cape. It just felt awkward. I would almost assume she studied Jodie Foster in ""Silence Of The Lambs"" Her line deliveries are very strange and her gait doesn't have that feel of a person of authority (people in law enforcement know what that walk looks like; Dakota seems to be attempting it, but comes off as a gazelle moseying).The action doesn't swell to where you want it to go. The original Denzel Equalizer felt so satisfying in doing away with the baddies. This one felt so...bland. Some of the violence is cartoonish. Such as shoving a gun through a guy's skull and firing through it (c'mon). While others feel like just run of the mill items of convenience used to make ugly bloody pulpy messes.The baddie in here is a nod to a town's gentrification. I know Denzel loves being the savior of the underdog, but does the script have to have it be so obvious. His tough guy words seem off these days. He was such a presence in ""Man On Fire"" That flame is gone.I get the link between Dakota and Denzel. It's as if you are a fan of ""Man On Fire"" and you want to know what became of Pita afterwards.Well, she's a spec op who walks funny.All in all, not a bad watch. It does what you want it to do. Nothing more, nothing less.","

"The Equalizer 3","Gringorilla","13 September 2023","The Equalizer has went the opposite direction of John Wick. While John Wick has become more and more action-filled and chaotic, The Equalizer has toned the action down in favor of more meaningful scenes and tone. But there is power in the pause! After learning from the first films what Robert McCall is capable of, every scene where he does not act on his abilities makes more of an impact. Instead of getting bored from tediously long action scenes, you get the suspense of waiting for hell breaking loose. And when it does, it is glorious.This movie is not without faults. It introduces some new characters that frankly doesn't need to be there as they don't affect the plot at all, and the ending is somewhat lackluster.The story itself is a pretty standard affair, but it is excellently excecuted. Throughout it you develop empathy for the right characters, antipathy for the others, and in general get a sense of the stakes at hand.All in all, this is, by a small margin, my favorite outing in the series.","

"The Equalizer 3","connecttoaakash","2 September 2023","I approached the theatre with minimal expectations, given that ""Equalizer 2"" had failed to live up to its predecessor's standard. Nonetheless, watching seasoned actors like Denzel Washington and Liam Neeson, both in their 70s, deliver relentless action remains a guilty pleasure of mine. Denzel's films consistently resonate more deeply with me, thanks to the emotional depth he brings, which is sometimes lacking in Liam's recent work.To my surprise, this sequel exceeded my expectations regarding its grounded and gritty nature. Denzel, a once-in-a-lifetime actor, excels at conveying vulnerability and loneliness through his expressive eyes and facial expressions. In this movie, he expertly portrays a character torn between conflicting emotions - doing the right thing or walking away.Director Antoine Fuqua, renowned for his ability to depict violence and its consequences, doesn't disappoint in this regard. The screenplay is tightly woven, with the first half focusing on the protagonist's quest for community and a sense of belonging.The cinematography is exceptional, beautifully capturing the picturesque Italian towns.A special mention goes to Dakota Fanning's inclusion despite her limited screen time. Her chemistry with Denzel shines, evoking nostalgia for their previous collaboration in ""Man on Fire.""Throughout the film, a recurring dialogue emphasizes that ""you are where you were supposed to be,"" while Denzel's character grapples with feelings of being lost. Strangely, after the movie's conclusion, I reflected on the same sentiment.","

The Italian Mafia.Being that the film takes place in Italy, it is of course beautiful. The final chapter has a nice story to it too, and caps the trilogy of nicely.The first film is still my favourite, although this one is next in line. Even though these are McCall's easiest foes, they may be the most satisfying deaths. He's more of Michael Myers slasher killer in this one. He's a straight up nightmare for these bad guys.Denzel Washington shows he is still one of the greatest actors of the last 35 years.","

"The Equalizer 3","hansefde","8 November 2023","I love the acting of Denzel Washington, this guy can be smiling very friendly at a victim and in in an instant be a cold blooded assassin. He is the sole savior of this film since it is a total trainwreck. Yes Italy lends itself for beautiful scenic shots and the maffia for a good story. But boy oh boy did they make it a good guys/bad guys script filled with nonsense. To name a few plotholes/nonsense: the internet gang hacks the bank account of a pensionfund so the pensioners loose their money. They transfer the money but then change it into cash. The maffia threathens a policeman and mutilates a head of police while corrupt policemen are usually assets that are bribed and blackmailed. On the plaza Robert is confronted with Vincent after killing his brother. But after the confrontation Vincent leaves without Robert (usually would have been pushed in a van and transported away). Robert knocks Vincent unconscious, but still manages him to let him eat his own drugs. How? Robert gives the bag with cash to a CIA operative with only the name of the man to which it belongs. A) how does this women gets the money into the USA without any problems and b) how does she know where to find him? It is all lazy scriptwriting, hopefully Equalizer4 will have an intelligent script that makes sense.","

Equalizer 3 is quite enjoyable was nice to see in imax, I can't decide which is better though but I'd definitely recommend this amazing action extravaganza! A lot more foreign based which I didn't expect yet Denzel made everything awesome and the acting is phenomenal throughout with more brutal action than than previous films. It's impressive that stylish stunts were done at high age. One of the most notable aspects is the gorgeous visuals throughout and entertainment value is great!","

I was surprised by the slow pacing but that does not mean that I did not like it.As soon as Dakota Fanning's character gets introduced, the film takes a turn for the worse. She is very obviously miscast, but that is no excuse for this bad of a performance. Just terrible! Every line is flat and she is completely out of her element. The attempt at being a tough girl is laughable.Then in the last 15 minutes everyone gets slaughtered in the usual Equalizer style, but I wasn't interested in/attached to any of the characters. So who cares?Denzel saves this movie as he is truly a fantastic actor.","

"The Equalizer 3","latinfineart","18 November 2023","I would say this was an entertaining film. I thought the Gomorrah guys were a little over the top, especially the big boss and his brother, but the movie was scenic and the local Italian towns were great. As usual with Fuqua, the direction seem to be handled well, and the writing wasn't bad. Denzel was great. Fanning was decent, but I felt she was miscast for the role, or perhaps they should have written her character as someone with more field experience. She felt like she was in over her head and did not feel like a feasible character.The one thing that I did object to was the soundtrack, it was one of the worst soundtracks I've heard in the past 10 or 20 years. It felt like it was done by a kid who was trying to be annoying, and there was absolutely no reason for that. Lots of good artists out there who could have created a soundtrack that helped to absorb one into the fail, instead of the opposite effect. Hopefully Marcelo Zarvos does not get any more films to degrade.","

US President Biden is 80 years old, and Hollywood, one after another, presents us with fighting grandpas. Denzel Washington will be 70 next year, but his hero Robert McCall is still ready to kill dozens of armed criminals with his bare hands, timing it with a stopwatch on his watch. Clear, this is a non-serious entertainment show. What's more serious is who the Americans are smearing with mud along the way. The evil Syrians are sending synthetic drugs (to be sure, with the Syrian flag is on the packaging) to the Neapolitan Commore. Using the huge money raised from their sale, evil Italian mafiosi make a bomb and blow up... a train station in Italy. Well, you've heard about unmotivated aggression. And only the CIA, in the person of blonde yesterday's schoolgirl, with the help of a retired volunteer bone crusher, can unravel this sinister scheme. The screenwriter is also close to 70 and he knows very well that the United States is surrounded by evil countries, in which the angels of good from the United States can do whatever they want, without trial.","

Maybe you do not have to watch them - as in this works as a standalone too. But especially the first one is one you should watch - still edges this in being the best. So much so, that back when it came out I was on ""Team Equalizer"" (against Team John Wick) ... I know, no one asked for that - at least officially.But some people were wondering who is better ... as much as I love Denzel Washington (let's keep it real, he is the better actor of the two), John Wick does not just have a movie more (both having TV shows, though Equalizer is not supposed to be any good, from what I've heard) ... but it is the better franchise! No denying that - and while the inferior second movie is almost forgotten with the final (?) entry in the franchise ... it is not erased. It is there - I quite liked that one too, but it did not hold a candle to the other movies.All that said, there was a lot of ... well people were telling me how brutal this one is. Maybe I have become used to it (movie violence that is), but while this does have a few really hardcore spikes ... when it comes to brutality, I was not ... shook (that's what people say nowadays, right?). There are also enough slower passages for us to relax and prepare ourselves for the next burst of action ... we know it is coming.The ending is a bit ... it feels almost rushed and yet it makes the most sense.

"The Equalizer 3","silicontourist","7 October 2023","Its very hard not to like Denzel (Washington) in any of his films over the years because, he is a superb actor who has great screen presence. Whereas the first 2 films were straight to the point, with a faster pace and some nice extra touches (like the emphasis of looking at his watch to evaluate killing time) this 3rd outing is, very laid back with a slower pace that matches the lifestyle pace of a place like Italy; especially in the islands. Its all done with an abundance of really cool style wrapped around a very good script. His payback to the thugs is done in a thinking, planned perfection (most likely the reason that the films critical dissenters did not like as it wasn't just wham, bang and dead). It was literally a cool, memorable and stylishly clever way to end on a good trilogy final note. Oh yes! He kills a ton of Mafia scumbags as well so, there is still a lot of Denzil's original villain disposing action sequences. And its all done amidst some of the finest scenery you will ever get to see in a film!I will miss this series of McCall Equalizer payback films.","

"The Equalizer 3","mselby-01342","4 January 2024","""The Equalizer 3"" dives into a fresh and engaging plot that, while somewhat detached from its predecessors, perfectly suits the enigmatic character portrayed by Denzel Washington. The film kicks off with a riveting scene where we're led through a sprawling estate, eerily adorned with casualties of Denzel's character's actions. This installment takes a different pace than your typical action-packed flick; it's slower, but this deliberate pacing is key to its charm. It allows for a thorough exploration of the narrative, and as viewers, we get to deeply appreciate the quaint Italian town setting. The depiction of the town's life is heartwarming, introducing us to affable locals whose lives are soon disrupted by the tyranny of a local mafia boss. This development cues the classic intervention by Denzel's character, resonating with the essence of the Equalizer series.Admittedly, compared to its high-octane predecessors, this film might seem like the series' underdog. However, it stands out with its unique storytelling and setting. If you're a fan of Denzel Washington, enjoy a good action film, and appreciate a story of justice, ""The Equalizer 3"" is definitely worth your time. It may not be the strongest in the series, but it's a commendable addition that offers a different flavor to the Equalizer saga.","

I guess they are doing these just to get that 1 or 2 weeks of ticket sales and hope for luck.You'd know the younger the generations would be spending money the moment they see the Equalizer title.Denzel should stop making himself looking like a clown for the legend he is.Same old same old, I would forgive part 2 since that one had a much more direct motive for his buffet killings. It was bad nonetheless.This is just unforgivable. Over dramatic unnecessary scenes, random motives, pointless plot, same killings, the corkscrew was the victim again.

"The Equalizer 3","rmmil","5 January 2024","I'll start off by saying I loved the first film in this series. I thought the 2nd film was ""okay"". The 3rd film, well...it has a great shooting location, I'll say that much.When crafting any story a basic requirement is some level of tension. An actor can be an absolutely amazing one like Denzel Washington, but if your script gives you nothing there's not much you can do with it.This film lacks ANY tension. The outcome is a foregone conclusion. The protagonist has, slowly, between each film, become more and more a ""John Wick"" level killing machine but his opponents in this film are about as tough as your average street thugs.There is never any moment when you think Denzel's character could lose. The final shoot out is a non event.The film pads its length considerably by adding in a pointless subplot to reunite Denzel Washington with Dakota Fanning. Fanning, playing the least believable CIA / NSA (?) operative in cinema history, exists in this film to be this weird nepotism favor Denzel gets involved with part way into the film, but her true purpose is to make a short-ish plot light film somewhat higher stakes.This was a big disappointment from previous Equalizer films.

Saw the rating on this one (Higher than the 2nd one!) so I went into it, thinking I was in for a treat. I'll say this for sure... 10 minutes in, I fell asleep...Oh man, oh man, oh man....... What the hell went wrong with this one? I love Denzel Washington. Great actor. And he's good in this. But this didn't feel like an Equalizer movie.First off, it's VERY slow. You get a decent opening sequence with some blood splatter & what not. But after that it's just a dull, plain, bland movie. Also the score/ost/music was VERY weird & annoying. It really bothered me that they didn't even bring back the original Equalizer theme.Seriously, the music is VERY bad.The ending is... Well... it's an ending I guess? If you're expecting McCall to kill the final bad guy in brutal fashion like the last 2 movies... Don't get too excited. It's actually a VERY boring death. I was counting on the watch with McCall and wondering ""bro, when's this dude gonna be dead?"" We literally follow this guy to his death for like 2 mins....So what was the point of this movie? Other than give Robert McCall his happy ending, I don't really know? Again, I love the first 2 movies. Was VERY excited for this one. But unfortunately, it didn't deliver at all. I will say it delivers utter disappointment.It took a couple years for the same writers of the first 2 movies to write this script to the final chapter... Seeing as how the 2nd film ended, that could've been the finale & to me, it will be.VERY disappointed. If you're expecting this to be on par with the first 2 movies, I promise you... You'll be disappointed. I'll only give it a 4/10 since some of the kills were good & denzels acting but that's really it. I'll never watch it again though.","

She is 29 but looks 20.. nah, she aint got the looks to try to be some CIA badass case agent.. for that, you should have brought Gadot, De Armas or maybe Johansson.. or Scarlett would have been awesome at this..ok, the last paragraph I was writing while watching the movie so at the end we understand why he was doing this.. she is a rookie and he pretty much feeds her all the info he himself finds because she had no actual intel nor the experience to come up with all those leads and deductions.. but you see.. that is the thing, without McCall to guide her, she would be easily become a one hit wonder..right? She breaks some crazy drug smuggling thing thanks 100% due to Roberto and then she wouldnt be able to do anything close to it later on.. but ok, details, right?And like another reviewer said.. the villains were ridiculous.. ""Teddy"" from movie 1 was much more menacing and presented a better challenge.. here, you have some punks terrorizing the city for half of the movie and when robert gets better, the dudes are gone next scene LOL..even the super bad guy.. he goes to the city, makes a scene.. next sequence, every one of his guys are gone and then he receives some nice OD to see how it is like to die by one..so, I would say the point of the movie was to make him find a place where he belonged and wanted to be there.. let us ignore the fact he aint probably got a visa.. and better yet, no job.. but infinite money for tea every day in the morning at the local cafféit doesnt matter.. it was just a fitting end starting with him helping someone he barely knew, helping the people he began to care about and also helping someone related to someone he really liked in the past.Well done.","

Definitely a slow-burn type of build-up to get the audience worked up and swayed to Denzel's savior side. Whatever. Yes, scenic views of the quaint little Italian village and cute villagers.

From watching the first two movies I also knew there was a big fight coming, but if I hadn't seen the first two movies I might have been tempted to turn the film off during this hour.When this fight starts I was kept very entertained especially when Robert fights off one of the main bad guys in a bar. The last fight scene involves some good stealth action because Robert has to sneak into a bad guy's mansion and kill some henchmen, but during this scene I would have liked to have seen some more hand to hand combat.The end of this scene also drags on for a bit as well, but overall I had fun with this film and I might watch it again... If I can't find anything else on TV/Netflix.","

"The Equalizer 3","will003","8 October 2023","What a great entrance! I think is a movie that deserves a 9 out of 10 because I expected a little more action than the movie had. But at the same time, different than in the second movie, Robert is fighting again remembering all the killing he did with an inside conflict without knowing if he is a good or a bad person -in the exact words of the movie. So he ended up in the small village in Italy and the rest is the story of the equalizer! This time, Robert is really trying to settle down in a special place and enjoy the rest of his days, but again is forced to act and serve justice.Considering this, the lack of action in this one in comparison to the other two movies is kinda explained considering that Mr Mccall really wants peace. At the same time, on the first two movies we see a Mr Mccall that is a good person but a sad and lost man that still feels the lost of his late wife. On Equalizer 1 and 2 he is helping people and it's notable that this helps him to carry on, but now, in his on words, Altamonte is giving back what he doesn't feel in a very long time: peace. Considering this, for the first time you see real RAGE when he kills each mafia individual, that's why he is ice cold on his kills! Absolutely amazing!The plot in the end caught me off guard. I don't know about other people, but I really did not expect the girl was who she was. Considering that I don't recall anyone bring her up in any conversation in the previous movies.Anyways, great plot, great scenes, Denzel is the goat in my humble opinion and you can see in his eyes he really hated the mafia that was tormented the people he learned to respect and that gave back the peace he had been looking for some years now.Justice was served again.","

"The Equalizer 3","fraser-simons","27 January 2024","Way better than the second one, which was just bad. And it returns to the weirdly American fetish of having spies and killers go to Italy and become enamoured with the people and culture, only to feel like they should intervene and save them from whatever - typically the mafia, of course. We had a brief respite from it with the return of Cartel bad guys and what not. You'd actually think villainizing Russia would be in vogue right now but I guess, who wants to go there and have a good time. It's cold and crappy, right?Anyway. This is very tropey but fun in its prograndist kind of way. There's always someone worse out there than the local drug lord, and it's always our main character. If you're in to this particular power fantasy the action is here for you and everything else is pretty passable. It's no John Wick, but it's better than the average action type movie these days, probably.","

"The Equalizer 3","imizrahi2002","16 September 2023","It's enjoyable...
the art and therapy of violence.It's a well put together story that offers the viewer an outlet for all of their existential angst...seems to be a lot of that going around today and movies like this help the viewer feel like they don't have to give vent to all that pent up feeling that life, as we've known it, is coming to an end. Hence, the therapy part of the second line...
i liked the setup. The editing was clever. I can't say how or it would be a spoiler. But you'll understand if you see it.The low ratings are a joke. Probably by guys who went to see it with their girlfriends. And when their girlfriends got either angry that they had been taken to such a violent movie...or did nothing but talk about how attractive Denzel is, all the way home, well...you can see why they rated it so low.And, of course, denzel's got this character DOWN! Just like most other characters he's inhabited...
so sit yourself down in the bloodbath and exit cleansed of your feelings that the bad guys never get their's...edit: and KUDOS to the composer of the OST...there's this part of when some of the violence happens...it's like the instruments are SCREEching! It got into my cells...i'm a musician that can play a number of instruments...have done recording and listened to more music than most 20 people would in a lifetime... and i can't quite figure out which instruments were used to attain that sound...it MIGHT just be some synth patch, but...in any case, it's VERY effective.","

this one not so much. Works as an ad for the Italian tourist board as scenery is lovely but baddies are from central casting and totally unbelievable. On the other hand the towns people are from straight out of Disney, friendly old ladies, shop keepers giving away fish, helpful retired doctor and angelic children - barf. The overall pace is slow and storyline predictable, Denzel is a one man Magnificent Seven saving the hapless residents.

Dakota Fanning's character comes out of the blue, no history behind, gets a big case and all of the sudden the entire CIA is behind her and they win against the Mafia. The mafiosso characters are nothing but dumb dumb people, just like any movie where the main character has to win. The script is awful, huge gaps in it, dumb dialogues which, sometimes, make no sense. There is no link between some of the scenes. It seems like there were short movies that have been added one after another. I wish this series had a better ending.","

It feels so far removed from the previous two movies I had to check who directed, Antoine Fuqua must have been on Syrian synthetic meth to deliver this. It felt so low budget, like a spaghetti western about gangsters. I'm assuming the wriyers strike caused problems as that would explain why we had 2 action scenes where Robert McCall takes out the baddie villa twice in a movie. The first time its shot without action, just a long tracking shot of carnage through the villa where McCall is revealed to have killed almost everyone but then surrenders so the big boss comes into the room..... so he can then kill him.... cos timing it so the big boss is there was too difficult presumably?Im really dissapointed. The worst part was that the supporting cast were so dreadful. It was nice to see Creasey and Pita back together even if they did shoehorn the big reveal of who her parents were, da da daaaaaa!It's a shame the Equalizer trilogy ends on such a weakened movie.","

"The Equalizer 3","alwinsup","31 August 2023","Just came back from the movie theaters; i loved it. The equalizer 3 has a subtle approach. The pace is not very fast but it never gets doll. Instead, you will floath allong with the main character Robert McCall (Played by Denzel Washington) in a lovely italian small city. The setting of this Italian small city is fantastic. You can feel the Italian vibe, the cozyness, the warmth and the simpleness of life where the whole village is one family.Maybe because i also have watched the other two parts and Robert McCall is for me a knowable character; i didnt mind the slow build-up before some action arrived. Instead you get to see more of the other side of his character which is great otherwise it would have been more a repeat of the first two parts. In this way you are more ''grabbed'' by the filmmakers and feel more connected with the ending of this trilogy. Because i dont know about you guys, but i left the movie theater with a smile after the last scene. I cant remember much movie trilogies with a ending thats feels so satisfying like the Equalizer 3 gave me.The action (there is still plenty of it) is good. It felt a little bit like John Wick but somehow also not. I love action shooters movie but believe the film makers did the right thing by not implenting to much over the top violence and shootings. In my eyes it would have disrubted the balance of the movie. Now.. the balance is just perfect and the main focus stays on the story line.Last but not least; i even laughed sometimes during the movie. But maybe not everyone will catch the same vibe as i did. In the end a solid 8 out of 10.","

We knew very well the final boss, Vincent, stood no chance against Robert, not to mention they know nothing about Robert. But then as the final scene rolls out, I realized this is the ending of Robert's story. He was always avenging for others, but this time he can protect them. He also found a place he calls home. The purpose and meaning of the music and cinematics throughout the movie now make sense to me, and I finally can properly appreciate the movie for what it is: a retirement tribute to Robert McCall.","

"The Equalizer 3","Ezpl8yer","13 September 2023","Which isn't a bad thing from the studio's perspective: it means that they have little to no excuses to make many more Equalizer movies. However, unlike Fast and Furious, where one cannot even count the movies anymore, The Equalizer 3 actually is marketed as the 'final chapter'. I say actually because the audiences probably won't notice that this is the final instalment in Robert McCall's story or at least what resembles a story of some sort. This lack of grand-scale storytelling over multiple films is partly due to the first two films on which this film is based on, but that doesn't excuse the film's own narrative problems and its inability to develop our main protagonist and his history from the first two films.Don't get me wrong: The Equalizer 3 is not a terrible film. It certainly improves on certain aspects of The Equalizer 2 and has qualities of its own. Unlike the second Equalizer film, Robert McCall, played by the always reliable and charismatic Denzel Washington, isn't going around the world saving and helping random people. In Contrast, he is much more grounded in a local community, very much like the first film but now in Italy. This gives the story more depth and focuses the plot, even though this advantage over the second film is not fully utilized which I'll explain later. Furthermore, the accompanying cinematography of the locations in Italy is what you expect from a movie of this calibre. The action scenes are also well shot, and mixed with some creativity and symbolism make them well worth the wait in this otherwise slow-paced action film. The accompanying actors all do what they have to do, with a standout turn from Dakote Fanning. On a sidenote, it is nice that actual Italian actors are cast and also speak Italian, in comparison to many Hollywood blockbusters where we have to endure over the top accents in the English language.However, even when these good components are brought together, the story somehow falls flat. In general, the movie is basically about our one-man army Denzel Washington fighting the Italian mafia due to their aggression towards the local people who saved him and gave him peace. Along the way, a bigger connection is formed with international drug trafficking which is where the CIA gets involved and discovers secrets of the Italian mafia Denzel is fighting against as well as secrets of Denzel himself. However, how exactly this connection with drug trafficking was established in the movie is still vague to me after having seen it.Unfortunately, the film has many of these plot points that are shoehorned into the story without much explanation nor elaboration. Although no plot holes are present in this movie, these type of plot points that try to expand the scope of the story fall flat. Not because they do not make sense, but because they do not move forward themes and ideas that are interesting, especially in relation to our main characters. That a mafia clan is bigger than we thought does not really surprise an audience in an action film. I won't reveal spoilers here, but the surprising reveal in the end on the character played by Dakote Fanning that somehow connects this film to the previous two is also disappointing because it is not developed nor played on much in the film, just like the mafia reveal. This is disappointing considering the on-screen chemistry between Denzel and Dakote Fanning.Overall, the story suffers from superficiality. The film is supposed to be about Denzel's character homecoming, him finally 'finding peace'. However, that is difficult to believe. Although much time is dedicated to building a sense of relation for Denzel's character to the local people, it still feels rather superficial in the end because there are no stand-out, well-developed side-characters who reveal something interesting about Denzel's character, let alone his history. He may well be integrated into the daily life of the small Italian town in which almost the entire film takes place, but it doesn't feel like there is a strong bond between the various inhabitants of the town and Denzel's character. Sure, the previous movies didn't flesh out the man's motivations and past, but if there was anytime to do it, it would be now in this third and supposedly last film. At least that is what viewers of the previous two films like me hoped for.This slow build-up that is present in the first half of the film is also undone by the action that follows it. When Denzel and the movie do finally get to business with the Italian mafia, Robert McCall's motivations are even more questioned since he pro-actively goes out to hunt down the members instead of more justifiably attacking them at home when he or his loved ones are threatened. Another home-alone like stand-off sequence as in the first two films would have maybe felt repetitive, but it feels weird to crack down on the mafia this hard with all the violence (this movie is not for the faint-hearted) included when little to no inhabitants of the town have actually been seriously threatened, let alone killed.Even more so, Denzel's character is not even attacked in a way that makes the audience scared of what's to come for him, unlike the first two films where friends were kidnapped, tortured, or even murdered. I guess the equalizer's job is to equalize natural enemies of the people as quickly and efficiently as possible, but it doesn't make for compelling storytelling when our main character does not go through much personal struggle nor physical pain to achieve it. In other words, Robert McCall is kind of too perfect an assassin to be actually believable. The same mistake was made in the second film, and although it looked like this film was steering off of it by injuring Denzel badly in the beginning, his recovery in the end reveals that the filmmakers haven't learned their lesson. It would have been a great opportunity to see him struggle after having to recover and being injured for so long, but his terminator-like skills just reappear without a problem.This makes the killing, although creative and gruesome in a stylistic way, muted since there is little to no danger or actual surprise. As a result, when Robert McCall's duty is over at the end of the film, it comes as a surprise because it feels like the typical processes that a protagonist should normally go through in a film in order for the audience to believe him or her are missing. In a time where films are becoming longer and longer, The Equalizer 3 could have used a longer runtime to implement the necessary scenes for both the story and our main character to be more compelling. Instead, clocking in at 1h49, the film is more style than substance. In this case, the style is greatly executed but given the fact that the action is more sporadic in this film than you would expect, the shallow story is hard to ignore. Both Denzel and the audience deserved better, especially since there was so much potential here.In the end, I would rate this film a 5.5: better than the second film thanks to the recycling of plot strategies of the first film but falling short due to similar mistakes of the second film. Thus, I would recommend to watch this film when it is on sale or released on your preferred home-entertainment platform instead of going to the cinemas for it. Not a bad watch, but certainly not as good as some say.","

"The Equalizer 3","jtindahouse","9 October 2023","My ratings for the first two 'Equalizer' films were 9/10 and then a drastic fall down to 6/10. I really enjoyed the first, but the second one I did not find the same connection with. This third entry in the series falls somewhere in-between those two. It was far from perfect, but it did enough to scrape its way to the finish line in one piece.The film has a pretty good opening scene. It was unexpected and unique, and set things up nicely. Then the film falls into a bit of a rut for the next hour or so. There are surprisingly few action sequences in this film. The ones that there are are great, but I certainly could've used more of them.The film has a good menacing villain, but much like the action sequences, it feels like we don't get enough time with him. The film unfortunately spends a lot of the runtime on the least interesting elements.What carries the film though is this character of 'The Equalizer'. He is undoubtedly very cool and lot of fun to watch when he is operating on screen. Sometimes things do all feel about too easy for him, but hey, we aren't coming to these movies for shocks and surprises in the script are we? We know what we are sitting down for and that's what we get. 7/10.","

"The Equalizer 3","marcussmith-79590","26 September 2023","Equalizer 3 (E3) delivers in a big way. The third installment of this film was more realistic and had a better ending than the second film and slightly less impressive than the first Equalizer. E3 differs from the first two films with it's European setting, possesses a strong storyline with a good amount of bloody action. Dakota Fanning plays a moderate role that made me reflect back to the film ""Man on Fire"" when her and Denzel paired together in another action packed film. I thought E3 was a solid film that delivered. The film's action sequences were gruesome and gory, but not too unrealistic. The plot was simple, but appropriate and Denzel's portrayal of Robert McCall was charming, fierce, and moral. The film hits the mark, especially since it's difficult to make a third film that isn't substantially worse than the first two.","

"The Equalizer 3","ginocox-206-336968","7 October 2023","The Equalizer 3 (2013), directed by Antoine Fuqua, starring Denzel Washington reprising his unstoppable vigilante role in the two earlier Equalizer films, offers excellent production values, credible performances, and an enjoyable viewing experience.The tone is a bit uneven. It begins with a sort of mysterious, suspenseful sequence, then grinds to a tedious pace somewhat reminiscent of scenes from Denzel's Man on Fire, then picks up the pace, although in a largely predictable formulaic manner.At 68, Denzel is a little slow and a bit heavy for the role, but is benefited from a quick-cut editing style. At 29, Dakota Fanning seems to have passed her window of opportunity for her role by several years and a few kilos. The other performances, largely by unfamiliar actors, are spot-on and credible, although a bit two-dimensional.The tepid B-story romance falls flat. The film is rated R for violence, but the love story seems better suited to a high-school stage play. Two loose ends seem distracting: the MacGuffin from the opening scene, and a potentially intriguing revenge angle involving a character who fired a .22 bullet. Overall, it could have benefitted from less attention devoted to the picturesque scenery and more effort at character development. Other than miscasting Fanning and the obligatory interracial love interest, the film thankfully avoids woke themes.","

"The Equalizer 3","dweston-38669","9 October 2023","It occurred to me, whilst watching this,? End of the trilogy, film that the Mafiaso/Cammora characters here are really repugnant, nasty ,vicious individuals -sucking off the blood and sweat of the ordinary working person for 'protection ' money which never really has been addressed in either The Godfather films or Goodfellas.And yet this is how all the 'Corleones' made their fortunes.It was, to a certain degree ,in The Sopranos...
This adds a certain depth to the villians in The Equalizer 3, that one feels a certain elation during the fight scenes. Something that Indy Jones and M.

"The Equalizer 3","levybob","1 September 2023","Seriously, if you decide to see 'Equalizer 3' you already know the sort of film, the sort of story, the sort of action you're in for. Hamlet, it isn't. Oscars it ain't gonna win. Subtlety is nowhere to be found. So, the question is,Given all that, will you be disappointed?I was, sort of.This McCall (Denzel Washington) seems somehow unrelated to the McCall of the earlier two films. He's no longer 'the regular guy' with a secret who just happens to work at Home Depot. No. It's as though he's been looking for trouble, and as the film opens he's found it. Or it found him. But here's the problem. He is so good at what he does (killing), and what he says (telling his victims what's going to happen to them and when) that when the fighting starts we know that nothing can happen to him. And so whatever suspense there might once have been, it's no longer there.But there's good to be had.(1) This Equalizer is shot in Italy (likely The Amalfi Coast) and it's great to look at. Its beauty makes for an ironic counterbalance to the violence that takes place.(2) Like in 'The Magnificent Seven' what we have here is a village being controlled by a band of hoodlums. Did I hear 'Mafia'? Could be. And so the stranger in town is faced with either walking away or helping the helpless in their battle against crime.(3) The bad guys are really bad. Unfortunately the worst of the bad guys gets off'd too early (for my taste).(4) There's a question raised early in the film. Is McCall a good man or a bad man. And when he's asked, McCall answers, I don't know. And after viewing the film in its entirety, I'm not altogether sure.Anyway, You know what you're in for. So, go and enjoy.","

"The Equalizer 3","lizma-02967","7 September 2023","I just watched the 3rd one instalment of the Equalizer series and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pacing was excellent and the characters were all well introduced. The bad guys weren't likeable at all and perhaps that's what prevented me from giving it a full 10 out of 10 score. I thought the story should have spent an extra 10 minutes or so to flesh out the bad guys, maybe something like their upbringing or background of their family. Make them just a little bit more 3d and not so 2d in the story.Denzel's character McCall is a superhero, simple as that, though one without any bullet proof skin or ability to fly. I suspended any disbelief to thoroughly enjoy myself since he's the most believable superhero possible. Robert (or his Italian name Roberto) McCall is a great superhero hero we really want to see in real life, calm, cool and knows everything there is to know about swiftly dispatching the bad guys using just his Flash-like speed and medical doctor knowledge of every square inch of the human body.It does seem like it's the final outing of Denzel or McCall as the protagonist but? I suspect the story seems to suggest the next episode is one where he returns as a guru to a protege. The setting could well be the same location in charming southern Italy where McCall seems very much at home.","

It seems the violent past comes back to haunt him though he wants to so desperately leave that behind. Still he can't help but be involved.Italian mafia bullies people who are poor and less fortunate and even the police can do nothing about it. Going so far as nearly having a police friend of McCall's getting badly beaten up and nearly killed.So McCall uses his brand of justice to finally end the mafia and find peace once and for all.Nice to see a Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington reunion.

"The Equalizer 3","dasa108","17 October 2023","Very good movie. The construction of the plot and the feeling of tension grows until an ending that has it all. It must be recognized that one of the keys to the film is to take us to a different place (the first two were in the US) and that place was magnificently filmed, generating visual delight. The casting, cinematography, cinematography and direction were top notch. A couple of details should be noted: the first is the loose end of the first sequence that one hoped would be resolved; The second is the lack of realism in the representation of crime (exaggerated) and the police (ineffective, corrupt) that does not go hand in hand with the reality of present-day Italy. Despite this, it is an enjoyable experience and represents his ideal role for the main actor. It is a film that has rhythm but honors great masters like Peckimpah where the violence can be fierce but does not necessarily take up all the footage. Recommended.","

Taking its setting in Italy this time with Robert (Denzel Washington) laying low and living with the people in a small town. Until they are being harrassed by italian mobster. Which he starts taking matters into his own hands. While the US government lead by Dakota Fanning is on Roberts trail.Plot is decent. Feels like an episodic thin story for the franchise. An italian mobster harrassing people for money and they are menacing the town by taking it over.Denzel Washington delivers the role and is always worth the watch with these films. Dakota Fanning is also a new addition which has some connections to Roberts past. While the rest of the cast ensemble is okay and the bad guys are forgettable.The action sequences is okay and gritty with its opening sequence. The action does fall thin in the climax.Overall, it is an okay film with a great lead and decent direction but falls short with its action and decent plot.","

"The Equalizer 3","imseeg","2 September 2023","Denzel Washington (rogue agent) goes to Sicily (Italy) to combat the Italian mob. And he wacks them all. The end.The bad: too little action, too much Sicilian scenery. Only about 5 figthing scenes, that's a bit meager. Sicily does look beautiful, but isnt this suppose to be another Equalizer edition (the final one) and doesnt every Equalizer movie has to have A LOT of thrilling fighting scenes? Bit disappointing to be honest.More bad: the (supposedly vicious) mob boss isnt impressive at all. So arent the other mobster guys. They look kinda silly and are way too easily killed by Denzel. No real thrill in that.Even more bad: Dakota Fanning is miscast as a (supposedly) tough cia agent. She looks too cute for that.Conclusion: Lacking in thrill, lacking in action, lacking in mean bad guys.Not any good?It's not all bad though. Denzel Washington is still COOL, CALM and COLLECTED, the way I like to see him, but it's too much looking like Denzel was on holiday on Sicily, instead of being a thrilling gangster movie.Ah well, despite the slowburning ""holiday"" look and feel of this last edition, it is still an enjoyable watch...but the first edition is definitely better, although the second edition is definitely worse, way worse than this one....","

"The Equalizer 3","travisvincent","5 December 2023","The third entry into the Equalizer series left me wanting no more. Part of the problem is it feels like Denzel Washington's heart wasn't in it like the first two. Also, the plot is thin and within the first 15 minutes I realized this was going to be paint by numbers, not breaking any new ground. The action is decent but the gore is over the top, reminded me of a horror movie and not an action movie. The cinematography however is fantastic. There are plot inconsistencies that could've and would've ended the movie sooner so of course the movie drags on. Add to that that half the movie or more is subtitled...and here's the kicker, I forgot to enable subtitles and when I realized I didn't, I didn't care and could still follow the plot. Dakota Fanning however, was a pleasant surprise and did a good job in her small role.To summarize: it's not a horrible movie but I expected more considering the star and series.","

"The Equalizer 3","smirn_dogg","9 October 2023","Simply another movie about the Americans ""freeing"" another country. The film advanced the common narrative of ""Oh poor (insert country name) is so oppressed, please, almighty Americans, come and save it!"" It also exploits the scenic Italian countryside and urban centres to make up for its lack of storyline, meaningful dialogue, and a failed attempt at romance between Denzel and the Italian waitress. It's really not worth watching unless you want to watch the pitiful remnants of Denzel's once great acting career fizzle out on the screen before you. I really expected more from Fuqaua, this was a garbage-quality film.","

"The Equalizer 3","MovieIQTest","28 October 2023","It's such a pain to watch this great actor to play a role that would be ideal for him 20 or 25 years ago; even 10 years earlier would be still okay for him, and of course, such flashback time zones would also be very comfortable for us to watch him playing that action hero. But this third movie about this character played by Danzel is just painful and tasteless to watch.He walked like an old man, even he tried to pretend he was still young enough to do the labor. His face was puffy, his limbs were loose without muscles, his lips even slanted to one side and dropped lopsided. When he played the regular patron in the diner, he looked exactly a regular black American retiree, old and spiritless. The characterization made him to constantly arrange and rearrange the napkins on the small table, by doing so, it also prolong the movie length. He climbed the endless steep steps with difficult energy, even it was his bullet wounds caused him so, but in the real world, he's indeed too old to climb so many steep staircases.Regarding the movie itself, it also turned out to be not so great to watch. I just could give it 2/10 Stars.","

"The Equalizer 3","bheadher","5 January 2024","Now why would I say that...perhaps because each of the Equalizer movies has a unique 'mood' to the story. Certainly 1 and 2 had plenty of villains, but 3 stands alone, allowing us all to see pure evil and how Robert McCall responds to that evil.Yes, Danzel pulls out all the stops this time, vanquishing evil the best way he can...from nowhere. Just like a ghost haunting the streets of a Sicilian town, he is not there and suddenly he is everywhere. At no time can you predict from where he will strike; yet you know he will. I'm sure you've noticed I am avoiding spoilers at all cost this time. For you to fully appreciate this episode in the Equalizer trilogy you must not have any preconceived notions on what happens next.Just enjoy this one, for it truly is SUPERB!!!","

"The Equalizer 3","dtswpod","15 September 2023","Favorite episode from the old TV show was when the this guy beats his wife and kid and to teach him the error of beating up people the Equalizer rips the guy to a bloody pulp. Lesson learned, it's bad to use your fists, except, you know, when it's okay.Credit to this film, it doesn't even pretend to be as high minded. Violence is pretty much the only solution in this picture and the movie shows plenty of it. And like the old Edward Woodward show, you won't mind much because the bad guys are 100%, grade A cartoons. Plus, it's Denzel doing the ass kicking and he's always a joy to watch, even when he displays what can only be described as the ability to become invisible.No, its not a super hero movie but the ability to become invisible must be one of the Equalizer's talents because the guy sure gets in and out of places without anyone seeing him. Or seeing him too late.Look, it's a stupid movie. You want the better angels of our nature go find Denzel's performance in The Tragedy of Macbeth. That's art. This is fun, garbage for the teenagers and those adults who know better but don't care.","

"The Equalizer 3","olcayozfirat","8 October 2023","As a fan of the series, I enjoyed it tremendously. While watching the movie lying down, I moved to a sitting position out of respect for McCall. My admiration for Denzel Washington reached its peak with the series. As they said they were going to force McCall in every movie, he took down the bad guys so easily, I swear I was filled with joy.And how beautiful the music in the finale was. It made me sad for an ending. However, I eagerly waited for the final music of the first movie, but it did not play. When the movie ended, I was sad that I would never have such a pleasant wait again.It is the 3rd and last movie of the series, produced in 2023. This time the movie takes place in Italy. Mccall came here again for some business and was shot by an accidental bullet. A person who finds him brings him to a doctor in a small town. During his recovery, Mccall sees the gang that haunts the town and begins to fight with his own methods.","

"The Equalizer 3","SoumikBanerjee1996","5 October 2023","Whenever the movie delved into action, or wherever the script decided to show its skill in showing blood and gore, every one of those instances begot some sequences that not only leave the audience in awe but also set a certain tone for the narrative to seek.However, every time it reverted to dramatic portions, less eventful segments of the script, so to speak, the intensity drops below expected levels, that impact is gone. The essence that was previously showcased is nowhere to be found. And that's primarily because of the weak writing (and an even weaker antagonist).Not to mention, the film, for the most part, came off as a grand advertisement for Italian Tourism rather than a full-fledged feature that was supposed to expand the 'Equalizer' universe!P. S. Denzel will do wonders as a psychopathic villain, I hope he gets to play one before he calls his retirement.","

"The Equalizer 3","cmkdakota-65369","17 September 2023","As a super fan of Equalizer parts one and two, I knew they had set the bar really high for this one. It's very hard for sequels to live up to the first one. Nevertheless, they did a very good job with this one by using a variety of venues to change it up a bit. First of all, the entire set and scene is in Italy.It is not daylight eye candy like in the current Greek wedding movie, but most of it takes place in a darker mode and for a good reason. There is one point when Denzel Washington is talking to a young misguided gang thug that the look upon his face is indescribable. Be forewarned that the movie is quite violent with lots of blood and gore and occasional rough language, but if you love a good David and Goliath movie, you will love this one. That is something else they've done very well: interweave the main character's sense of his obvious dedication to and faith in God with his mandate to spend much of his life slaughtering evil people.","

"The Equalizer 3","xxxxxdarkmoon","9 November 2023","Don't believe in extremely negative reviews and ratings. Haters gonna hate no matter what.If you enjoyed parts 1 and 2 of The Equalizer franchise, you'll love this final 3rd part.Part 3 takes it to the next level.I have to warn all people who have wrong expectations: This is NOT a non-stop action fireworks, like a superhero in a video game, when hundreds of enemies shoot at you, but all of their bullets miss. As it is happening in the almost simultaneously released John Wick 4 movie.Nevertheless, The Equalizer 3 is outstanding. This time around, Robert McCall seems to be more relentless towards the villains than ever before. And the reason for this is explained. The director took the time necessary to show why McCall does what he does. So the film is never in a hurry. But when it comes to the fight scenes, you'll see the most merciless Robert McCall you've ever seen. As mentioned before, the directory explains why that is, why Robert McCall is so relentless.However, the director does not make it seem like McCall is invulnerable. McCall almost dies in one of the scenes.This is the most emotional part of these three.I have to admit that I had tears in my eyes for the last 15 minutes. It's a good ending. McCall seems happy in the end. This is more than I expected. And, he tries as best he can NOT to be the hero. But he simply is.I also would like to mention that there are beautiful landscapes/images. The location is great. Great cinematography.So don't believe in extremely negative reviews and ratings. Haters gonna hate no matter what.","

Many times. It's Clint Eastwood dressed as the Equalizer.

I love Denzel! I would watch anything that he's in. But his character development throughout this film flatlined. I wanted to like this movie more than I did.

If anything, they got the (extremely cringy) preachiness of original Robert McCall right, and not anything else.Odd enough, third installation of this series isn't half bad. It's slow and grounded, but this actually works really well for the title. McCall ends up in saving a small Italian coastal town from cartoonishly evil mafia, and save for some water-muddling with terrorism and CIA (that doesn't really matter nor work), contained plot and location turns out to be a really good idea. It's classic ""good, unarmed citizens vs. Evil baddies"", much like any 1980's show -- including some episodes of original ""The Equalizer"".Running at pleasant length of under 2 hours, almost everything goes will with this title.

This is the fourth time director Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington have worked together. They have a great rapport with one another after working together multiple times. Denzel not only did a sequel but made a whole franchise with Fuqua. Something Denzel does not do and has never done till now.It was surreal seeing Dakota Fanning working with her life-size ""Creasy Bear"" again. If you don't know they worked together some twenty years ago in the film ""Man on Fire"". It sucks because that would have been cool seeing them promote this film together all these years later.As a whole the film was good. The storyline seemed separate from the other previous films but they were able to tie those films storyline in toward the end. I'm not sure where I rank this film with the others. I think the second film is my favorite. There were a couple of slow moments in this film but it helped build the overall plot.Denzel Washington even at his age still shows he's still him. Giving you great performances and those moments that make you chuckle. There is an idea floating around that Fuqua said he loved. Denzel's son John David Washington playing a younger version of ""McCall"". I think that would be a great film.If ""McCall"" is this proficient at his age can you imagine what he was like when he was younger? I guess I will have to wait and see. A fitting end to a consistent franchise. I give it four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

"The Equalizer 3","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","25 September 2023","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulRobert McCall (Denzel Washington) is living in seclusion in a small town in the Italian hills, hoping to put his violent, destructive past behind him. However, his peace is typically short lived, and after a violent altercation, he is granted refuge by Dr Arsio (Remo Girone.) The town is under attack from a protection racket run by a vicious local mafioso, and after a trip to the local winery, McCall also finds dogged federal agent Collins (Dakota Fanning), on his trail, who has a connection to his past that has relevance to his present position. It all builds up to an explosive final confrontation with the wrong-doers that will have a decisive outcome.Over a timespan of nearly ten years, The Equalizer, a modern day cinematic series adapted from a 70's television series, has become an established franchise that runs in the pantheon of recognised action staples. The director/star dynamic has remained a constant as well, with sixty plus lead star Washington in the lead, and director Fuqua at the helm in each. I trust most people would agree the original was the best, but the original director staying on seems to have recreated the magic for a significant number of fans, but surely everyone can agree three is the magic number.The sheer pointlessness of the whole thing overrides everything, a hollow, insincere effort seemingly seeking only to desperately appeal to fanboys for a quick buck. It repeats the formula of the first two films almost interchangeably, playing out in the most by-the-numbers manner possible, with nothing to make it stand out in its own right. Which is a surprising fault, given the sheer lack of action in the whole thing, with long, boring segments playing out, not punctuated with anything really stimulating in between. There's just nothing of oompth to the story, the villains or the hero. Denzel has the simmering intensity to lift anything, but even he feels drained in this.Everything I say about it, I could have said about the sequel, but that feels like an elevated experience compared to this lifeless, pointless exercise. Some entertaining, brutal action is all that gives it any sort of distinction. **","

"The Equalizer 3","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","3 October 2023","Unlike The Equalizer 1 and 2, this film is surprisingly underwhelming. It's not just because it has less action compared to those movies, but because it has a plot which is haywire and hard to process. I still can't understand what the plot was about. Denzel is the only reason you should watch this if you're interested but otherwise this can be skipped as it fails both as an entertaining third part as well as an ordinary action film in general.The film's first 10-something minutes are spellbinding. I expected more of that, but I guess the makers needed to stop at that and release this as a short film instead. The action scene itself has been all over the promos and hence doesn't surprise you when you see it, but it's the only actual memorable part of the film.From there, it goes on a downward spiral because what follows is not a movie but a sequence of random, forgettable scenes. The first two movies not only had a lot of action, but their character drama was also on point. This is clearly missing here, and the film turns out to be dull. There's no suspense or thrill factor going on beyond the opening sequence, and even the finale fails to stand out. The villains were weak and at no point did I hate them.Robert McCall's desire for peace didn't carry much emotional weight either. I didn't feel any emotion by the time the film ended. This is a rare disappointment from Denzel Washington and has surprisingly nothing going in its favor except the locations, the actor himself as well as the few action scenes. It's pretty average and forgettable, and something I won't call a perfect film to end this franchise with. If they make another, I'll give it a watch just for Denzel and the first two movies which I have revisited multiple times. But this one... not really.","

It is tho made with unexpected style by terrific returning director Antoine Fuqua AND is set on Italy's beautiful Amalfi coast, in an idyllic community on which Washington recovers from another guardian angel type revenge mission. Returning writer Richard Wenk then has this community plagued by vile mafioso's (like Andrea Scarduzio & Andrea Dodero) so Washington has to get violent again (pulling in the CIA (Dakota Fanning) on the side).

He gives so much to do so little in order to make Robert McCall such an interesting character when all he really needed to be is a blunt weapon of destruction like John Wick, but Denzel is too good for that, and Antoine Fuqua goes with the flow making something perfectly structed for an actor of Denzel's Calibur. Don't have to be a fan or familiar with the other two movies to 100 percent enjoy number three, but familiarity with the other two movies does enhance small things that naturally tie all of them together.Denzel has to be around the same age Liam Neeson was when he did the first Taken film.

"The Equalizer 3","boblipton","14 November 2023","Denzell Washington is back in the role, killing people with ruthless efficiency in the service of people who can't defend themselves. This time he's in Sicily killing Mafia, but discovers an oddily: lots of drugs coming through one of the most secure ports in the world. Wounded, he makes his way, inexplicably, to Naples, where he recuperates and discovers some lovely people. But Camorra thugs burn down a fish market he's fond of, so he kills them, and finds himself in the hairs of the head of one of the Camorra clans. He also informs CIA operative Dakota Fanning of the drug situation.I will watch Denzell Washington in the most arrant nonsense. He is believable in any role he chooses to play, even MacBeth. However here, as in other recent action movies he has undertaken, he is under the direction of Antoine Fuqua, and I have issues with that. Fuqua invariabl gives the audience a lot of bloody scenes. Sometimes I try to convince myself he is spoofing the love of blood, or that he is offering the audience the sating of blood lust that Elizabethan revenge dramas did. I can never do so. He just likes offering bloody scenes in place of character or plot development. I also have issues with his dark lighting and muted color palette.So, it's a mixed effort, so far as I am concerned. And when Fuqua and Washington do their next ultra-violent movie, I'll see it, because of Washington.","

"The Equalizer 3","andrew-marks59","1 September 2023","Let's start out with the good. Denzel. C'mon, he's always good and in this he's still got it. Funny, hard-hitting, and a seemingly untouchable leading man.The bad speaks for itself if you end up watching it. The pacing is slow in the first half, the action is barely there, and it seemed even more unnecessary than the second Equalizer film.Let's just say you're writing a script and you introduce a large plot point that could severely cripple the lead character. Would you:A. Bring it up later to challenge the protagonist in a confrontation.B. Never address it again.You can probably guess what the screenwriter ended up choosing.McCall is good and in this he's too good. Not once was he challenged. He gives two beatdowns in the second half of the film without a scratch to himself. It's boring to watch and even harder to watch because the first half of the film was already a snooze.It's sort of like a non-film that prides itself in taking a crap on good times. The worst part is I paid to see it. I paid to get crapped on and I don't even usually like that sort of thing. Leave it to the people on Craigslist, they're the real professionals. Antoine Fuqua and his team, who are usually pretty good, decided that hiring professional wet workers and whatever their crap equivalent is, was too much of a bother.","

The villains are set up to be awful (the film does very well in doing that), so you want them to get what's coming to them.Without giving spoilers, most of the film is set in a small town in Italy, and it does a great job of showing us what life is like there and you really connect with the community.

"The Equalizer 3","aaaaaron-frannnnnnnn","7 September 2023","So, this movie was a good and fun action movie. After very heavy movies like Oppenheimer and political movies like Barbie, we needed a break. So Equalizer 3 was a breath of fresh air: Denzel happens upon a small and friendly town, which he protects from mobsters. No big twists, no messages - just a good movie with impressive kills and one-line speeches. This is not an ocscar movie, but nor was it trying to be. If you like watching a guy, who kills some bad guys, this movie is right up your alley.The small touch of Dakota Fannings character being the daughter of Denzel's friend in the first movie was nice.","

"The Equalizer 3","sammyadelaiye","5 September 2023","Very violent and fast paced and somehow feels like a punisher movie, but also feels like a worthy follow up to man on fire. The master & apprentice chemistry between Denzel and Dakota gave me flashes of their father-daughter like relationship in Man on fire. We see the protagonist more vulnerable, showing more emotion. The action scenes had me twitching and on the edge of my seat and the way the town is shot with the beautiful cathedrals and historical European architecture and streets I loved the supporting cast and the heavy themes of community and kindness. You may need a tissue, it's a surprisingly emotional ride.","

"The Equalizer 3","jon_anderson77","17 September 2023","Went into this with apprehension purely because in my opinion movies that move their location to Europe usually take a hit in quality (Rush Hour 3, Taken 2) but part 3 of the Equalizer really turned out to be the exception. Paced in such a way that the bad guys doing bad things builds the anticipation of the destruction you know is coming their way. Having McCall injured lends really well to Denzel who lets face it is getting on in years so prob doesn't want to be doing a lot of stunt work, not that there isn't any and when the action takes place it's impressive. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy what appears to be the end of the franchise I think it's actually my favourite of the 3. It's beautifully shot, the location and his intentions lend perfectly to the characters original role as a man helping others out of bad situations and the dispatching of the baddies when it happens is brutal and satisfying. If I had a complaint about plot it would be the end set piece could have been better and was a bit basic. The final boss got off far too lightly in my opinion. The conclusion of the first movie in the home depot type location is hard to beat for this and is just a great bit of cinema set to a brilliant soundtrack. Complaints wise. Dakota Fanning being in the movie was completely pointless and was obvious fan service for those who saw and love Man of Fire. She's a pretty terrible actress now despite being a pretty good child actor and they would have been better off casting someone else in the role especially as she is barely in it. Other than that it's one I look forward to owning and re watching when it's released on blu ray. Solid 8.5 for me.","

"The Equalizer 3","chand-suhas","5 October 2023","Back to basics and once again it has a simple story. Robert McCall is on his vigilante mission to find a cyber ghost and well he does. He rather uncovers a larger crime happening and gets shot while trying to leave. Badly injured, he almost loses his conscious when he is taken to a doctor by a Carabinieri at Altamonte. McCall bonds with the people there and feels this to be the place he belongs. Sadly the place is tormented by the local mafia and once again, poor mafia fails to figure out who they are messing with as McCall sets his timer on them.The film has basically two and a half action scenes rest filled with scenes where McCall gets himself acquainted to the new place and people, which takes most part of the film. This one amplifies the drama compared to the other 2 films and yet knows to play to it's strength. Almost an hour between the two action scenes might be tad bit boring but Denzel Washington ensures to get one hooked to the story. The villains well by the numbers are weakly written and no match to the lead character but then, the action scene kind of feels worth the wait.","

"The Equalizer 3","rebeltaz-18705","3 March 2024","Twenty minutes. That was as long as I could take it. The first Equalizer was great. The second one was pretty good. I had high hopes for this. I don't know why. There hasn't been a decent movie come out of hollywood in over a decade. But... I was hoping...For twenty minutes, I sat through an Italian language film. In that entire time, there was MAYBE a dozen words in English. I have no desire to READ a movie. If I want to read something, I'll pick up a book. As a matter of fact... that's exactly what I did as soon as I turned this off.The scenes that I did see jumped from one place to another with no rhyme nor reason. Denzel is in one diner having dinner. The next second he's in another street cafe having tea. We bounced all over Italy in the twenty minutes that I could sit through.There was absolutely no story whatsoever before I stopped watching. Whether there was EVER any story, I don't know, but by that point, I could NOT have cared less.","

"The Equalizer 3","kh-17438","5 January 2024","I have watched all the Equalizer movies, Equalizer 1, 2, and now 3. It seems sometimes bad guys win and dominate in real life so watching them die extremely violent deaths in the Equalizer movies seems fair and just in the not so real life.I'm older now and aware of when people are acting and Denzel's Equalizer movies make me forget he is a character. It's not that I am going to stand up in my living room and cheer him on and my best compliment I can give a movie is I look up the ending while I am watching to make sure it is not awful. I'm investing my time and don't want to waste it. The night I started Equalizer 3 I had left my phone in my sister's car so I had to fast forward to the end to make sure Denzel made it out okay, and then I had to go back the next night and watch it again. Which was tonight. I loved it!","

"The Equalizer 3","RonellSowes","7 January 2024","Granted in the overwhelming majority of action movies the hero gets all the bad days and lives happily etc. However, there can at least be a little, unlikely bit of jeopardy if they're not superhuman-like Robert McCall. If you've seen the previous movies you know what you're getting into here, but either way the fiona demonstrates his omnipotence at the very start. Opening on the carnage of some dozen henchman he's just killed before he disposes of the last few from a chair with guns pointed right at him; all in a matter of precisely timed seconds. This guy obviously has nothing to worry about with the small town goons he deals with the rest if the movie. The action is hard hitting though far fetched and just because it uses a lot of blood doesnt make it realistic. Pretty much everything about only works if you think about it as little as these filmmakers did. The lulls in between the action, perhaps to flesh the movie out, only serve as a halt. And this movie adds all the usual trivialities to increase our care but as always, ultimately the only reason we're interested is Denzel Washington.","

"The Equalizer 3","hoernkeem","31 January 2024","Eric's Grade: C-
This is the third installment in the popular 'Equalizer' film series starring Denzel Washington in his continuing effort to have Liam Neeson's action career. 'Equalizer 3' is directed by Antoine Fuqua who directed the previous two installments. This is yet another project that was delayed to COVID-19, but finally got filmed in 2022 and released in 2023. Along with Washington the most notable costar who shows up is Dakota Fanning who starred with him 19 years previous in 'Man on Fire'. Even though Washington's action hero is showing his age, he is still a popular, bankable movie star as 'Equalizer 3' took in $191 million dollars at the box office.Washington stars once again as avenger of the downtrodden Robert McCall, and in an introductory action scene he takes out a gangster at a winery in Sicily, but he is injured. He winds up rescued by a local peace officer on mainland Italy. He is taken to a secluded town on the Amalfi coast to convalesce. As he recuperates he begins to become more enamored with the town and the local populace. He notices the townsfolk being intimidated by the Camorra which is essentially the mafia. McCall takes this personally and eventually must spring into action to protect this town from the villains that would exploit it.I had heard good things about this movie, but I found it lacking throughout. First off and most glaring is that Denzel is really showing his age here, and it begins to be more difficult to by him as a one man action dynamo. The action set pieces here did not impress that much. It is hard to buy that this one man is battling essentially organized crime. It feels more like he is just cleaning up the streets of a small overly aggressive gang and not one of the most feared criminal organizations in Europe. Additionally the whole inclusion of Fanning's character and the CIA angle to the plot feels entirely inconsequential and nonessential to the story of McCall trying to protect this town. I can still buy Robert McCall protecting people from a group of baddies that would do them harm, but this plot tries to be too large for its own good, and McCall's mission becomes unbelievable by extension. Denzel Washington is getting a bit long in the tooth to make an action film like this seem anywhere near plausible. It is still possible but his character has to pivot using wits more than brute force and in your face violence. It is a dual edged sword though because this series is built on intelligent violence, and unfortunately the action here is as weak as plot. The movie is watchable and mildly entertaining, but not as good as we really want it to be.","

"The Equalizer 3","markomiklic-93837","4 October 2023","If the idea was to make a movie where Denzel comes to Italy to find his peace, and to meet some people who embrace him, only to find out that some scumbags give them the hard time, and then he wipes them out in trademark Equalizer fashion, it would be everything you would expect this movie to be.What happens instead is, the movie tries to be more than that, and the result is that it falls flat on both the action part (there are literally 3 action scenes which last like 5 minutes altogether), and the plot is so lame and contrived that by the time the credits rolled, I was like ""What the heck was that about?"".Enjoy the opening scene, which is the only ""Equalizer"" part of the movie. If you stay beyond that, get ready to watch Denzel drinking tea in a bar for over an hour.","

"The Equalizer 3","kgprophet","18 October 2023","Spoilers AheadDenzel Washington has been an A list actor who almost consistently chose projects that wouldn't disappoint his audience. His strong acting skills bring integrity to the Equalizer franchise, and consistently deliver on the goods. The third outing received mostly good reviews, with the caveat that we should expect more of the same. The setup is appealing, our hero is stuck in a lovely little town in Sicily. The bulk of the film shows Denzel becoming friendly with the locals. It is no wonder why the majority of the running time shows him interacting with the supporting cast. Denzel has a natural charm, but a somewhat foreboding presence, and it works well here.Because of the main character's actions, he has the potential to bring trouble to this peaceful community. But here is one of the points in the story that isn't really exploited to it's full potential. Similar points in this refreshing take on the retribution genre are left unexplored. A sympathetic doctor is seen as a respected elder in the town. There is a tiny hint of his military history. He should have been more involved fighting the mafia gang that harasses local merchants. Another missed opportunity is Dakota Fanning's CIA character. She has a vulnerability reminiscent of Starling from ""Silence of the Lambs"". She is a fish out of water when she comes to Italy. She needed to have a more hands-on situation in tracking down the bad guys. For instance, we find out she is a marked for a hit by the mafia. This could have been realised as a more tense action sequence than what does occur. Sadly, her screen time is very limited.There was also something missing in Denzel's character as he witnesses the harassment. I think his moral dilemma could have been explored more. With an Oscar winner leading the way, the potential for a more serious crime drama, ""Godfather"" style is missing here. As Denzel's character finally carries out the retribution, the large scale showdown we all expected doesn't happen.Major SpoilerWe instead are supposed to accept that this large mafia figure's compound has only one aloof bodyguard standing at the main gate. Without first checking in, he opens the gate and lazily checks out a car alarm. Denzel, or anybody for that matter, easily takes out the one guard and waltzes into the compound unnoticed. The subsequent killing spree didn't rise above expectations. I thought to myself ""OK there will be the surprise confrontation at the end of the film"". We are made to believe the story has been resolved and everyone lives happily ever after. Maybe when Denzel goes back to Boston. But no. It turns out all the buildup, with the likeable Doctor, the CIA chick, the Shop Owner, The Young Cop, and others, are left on the wayside through most of the third act. Likewise, with the inevitable comparison to the John Wick franchise, the action sequences are too quick and on a smaller scale than you would expect. Or, if compared to the ""Taken"" franchise, Denzel doesn't have a hero moment rescuing the CIA agent from peril.The lack of more action is curious, since this film should have had a large enough budget. So ultimately I have tag this production as lazy. For instance, the majority of Denzel's scenes have him sitting comfortably, usually at a small cafe. Even when confronting the bad guys. I understand Denzel is in his elder years, but his character works better being more agile. The same for the Doctor with the military past. He could have been more involved with confronting the gang. It would've be an effectively shocking moment in the story if the beloved Doctor was killed by the gang (which I thought was the case when someone is left to hang outside a broken window). This would create a really strong reaction by the townspeople, and more importantly, motivate Denzel's character to take action.So sadly, an underwhelming script with Denzel shown mostly enjoying his Italian vacation, is only mildly interesting as the designated bad guys are knocked off in interesting ways. All that was really left was the gorgeous cinematography of this photogenic Italian coastal town. I hesitate to not recommend this low scale revenge flick, since it is made better than most of these types of films with numbers at the end of their titles However I still give it a 5 out of 10.","

"The Equalizer 3","isaacsundaralingam","1 September 2023","Denzel Washington was first Robert McCall 9 years ago. And with this third instalment in what can be described as a decent enough action franchise, he's finally hanging up the gloves.Directed by Antoine Fuqua; who also made the first two movies, The Equalizer 3 is probably everything you'd have come to expect; from Denzel's charismatic performance set against a generic enough plot, to decent action, hit-or-miss dialogues, uncompelling motivations and a 'sure why not' climax. It's fun and never boring, but it's also never that great either.Is it sad that we'll probably never get to see Denzel being Robert McCall again? Not really, but was it fun seeing Denzel be Robert McCall for three movies? Yes, absolutely.","

The villians were brutal, so he uses the same brutality to stop their terror.Fanning was excellent. She did not over act, and it was good to see them together again working to save the village.Normally long build ups bore me, but not this time.

"The Equalizer 3","Neptune165","2 December 2023","The Equalizer is such a high impact movie. If three is Denzels last one, I feel they should continue the story line with the girl. She knows him better than anyone. Denzel as the equalizer puts so much passion into every scene, it's hard to see it come to an end. Job well done! Played with compelling depth by Denzel Washington. This film transforms the typical action hero into a figure of complex introspection. Director Antoine Fuqua artfully blurs the lines between McCall's hard-edged vigilante justice and his reflective, almost philosophical side. Here, McCall is not just a dispenser of justice; he's a man in a contemplative battle with himself, questioning the morality and impact of his actions. Washington's performance elevates McCall beyond the typical action fare. He brings a thoughtful, almost introspective quality to the character, turning him into a kind of warrior-poet amid chaos. The film's style mirrors this complexity, combining straightforward action with moments that verge on the surreal. Ultimately, 'Equalizer 3' stands out as a thought-provoking paradox, offering both a thrilling ride and a contemplative character study. It's a narrative that engages the audience on multiple levels, encouraging both serious reflection and a subtle appreciation for its deeper nuances.","

"The Equalizer 3","arungeorge13","4 October 2023","Yeah, the action is less this time around. Yeah, the supporting characters are lacking. Yeah, the antagonists are one-note. But, can anyone question Denzel's screen presence? The man effortlessly swings between being the sweetest human being in one scene and the most deadly assassin in another. It was also nice to see Dakota Fanning reunite with Denzel (a wonderful callback to Man on Fire), and their exchanges, though meant to be expository, carry a warmth that's hard to brush aside. The action blocks are assigned only when they're absolutely needed, and that was indeed a pleasant surprise. We know Denzel's 68, and we don't need to see him doing anything over-the-top (even within the logical confines of the series' universe) at this point.Robert Richardson's cinematography captures the quaint beauty of Italian towns, with some truly fantastic night shots. Marcelo Zarvos, a more recent Denzel and Fuqua collaborator, adds a bit of grunge to the mafioso proceedings. All that said, the emotional stakes are comparatively on the lower side. The Sicilian neighborhood (and its people) comes across as endearing, but we don't exactly know what particular incident triggers McCall where he, once again, decides to take things into his own hands. Well, I guess these films aren't meant to be much more than forgettable-yet-enjoyable fare.. and Denzel & Co. At least know when to call it a day.","

"The Equalizer 3","mfeierskov","22 October 2023","A different, but very good entry into the series. The character growth across the three movies is subtle, but noticable and that's why the different tome of this movie works very well. Even though there is less action than the previous movies, the pacing is great, and it's not at all boring. Seeing Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning in the same shot 20 years after Man on Fire, was honestly kind of an emotional moment, because of how amazing that movie is.Even though I've enjoyed the series very much, I hope they don't make a fourth. This would be a good place to end it knowing that McCall would have found a home, friends and possibly love.They kept the door open for a continuation of the franchise with the way he passed the torch to Dakota Fanning, but I don't really think they will do it, since she wasn't really a field operator, and it would seem out of place for her to carry on an action franchise.","

I thought the film was a good addition to the full story and had me on the edge of my seat again. The action remains sublime, they could perhaps have gotten more out of the film to extend the story a bit, but all in all it was still a good movie.They did their best to make the film consistent with the two previous films, even though it is in a different setting and a completely different place.If you want a good action film with a good story, this film ticks a lot of boxes.I never really write reviews about films, even though I have seen a lot of films and I do have an opinion, I may not always dare to share it, but everyone has a different taste in films of course. I am writing this review because I definitely want to see a 4th movie with Denzel and see how Denzel's story comes to a complete conclusion. Because I think we now have an open ending again and don't really have an ending.Here is my personal opinion: if they plan to make a 4th movie then it should be with Denzel and otherwise they shouldn't start it. No one can replace Denzel in this series.","

Though understanding that this was intended to show Robert's growth and acceptance of actually wanting to settle down, it did this very well.It was easy to see how much he only wanted to live in peace and he went for exceptionally quick and efficient kills with minimal risk to himself. It was even a bit anticlimactic for the final showdown.This movie was shot in such an amazing location all I could think about was needing to take a vacation or to move to Italy and just learn about all of the interesting sites and areas.I hope they don't try to continue the series indefinitely.

"The Equalizer 3","Cinema-reviewer321","4 October 2023","I liked the first movie The Equalizer (2014) and thought it was a cool action movie starring Denzel Washington, and the sequel The Equalizer 2 (2018) was ok and not as good as the first, but Denzel Washington was the best part of the movie. Now on the third and last movie for the Equalizer movies, I thought The Equalizer 3 (2023) was as good as the first film with it being an entertaining action movie but also a good ending to this trilogy of films. I also liked how Denzel Washington's character Robert McCall is trying to retire and be at peace in Italy, but he must deal with this Italian mafia terrorizing this town in Rome.Once again Denzel Washington as Robert McCall is great in the movie, and I like how his character is thinking about what he is doing and if what he does is a good thing or terrible thing, even if it means protecting other people. Though there are cool action scenes, there are not that many, and we get to see Robert McCall making friends and helping people in the town in Italy and is trying to stop certain situations in a nicer less violent way, but if that does not work, he will have to resort to violence. Also, I liked Dakota Fanning's character Emma Collins; she was an FBI agent that was good at her job, and I liked the interactions between her and Rober McCall with certain situations involving the Italian mafia and how they are affecting the residents of the town.The main antagonists being the Italian mafia, they are standard villains that do not have much about them, other than they take whatever they want from the people of the town and hurt them whenever they can. When there are action scenes, they are fast and brutal with Denzel Washington doing a fantastic job in them giving them his all, and the ways he is killing people are creative and bloody. The movie has better pacing than the second film and is shorter than the earlier two films; where the second movie felt slow with its pacing and felt longer than it should, this movie felt fast when it needed to be and had a good runtime of one hour and forty-nine minutes.The Equalizer 3 (2023) was nice conclusion for this trilogy of films and it was better than the second film along with it be as good as the first movie; Denzel Washington was great, I liked how Robert McCall is trying to live a peaceful life, the action scenes were cool and violent, and I liked the location being Italy. If you liked the last two films, you would like this; people will like seeing Denzel Washington back in the lead role for the last time, and like the cool action like the other two films. The Equalizer films are not perfect action movies or anything like that, but they are well done action movies that I would suggest checking out if you have not already.","

The filming locations were wonderful but it lacked with colors. I mean the quality of cinematography was not fine and I didn't like the soundtrack.

He still got it and especially because it is him as the main character.

He thinks that he would retire quietly and far away from home, but the Camorra mafia has other plans for him, when he witnesses how they tare apart the nice community, which gave him the peace and silence to get back to normal.We all know were it is heading, but still Denzel manages to be very dominant and influence the final outcome and result of the movie, which could have easily dropped and crashed without him.It is well written, though the common sense was dropped of once the movie began. No one cares because each and every one who came to see the movie, has arrived to see Denzel kick some asses and he definitely does.The movie is extremely violent but shorter then the last two and were he could have gone wrong, the trusting directing hand of Fuqua corrects and of course there are not a lot of actors as Washington that can salvage this caliber of a movie at Hollywood these days - he totally does it.","

"The Equalizer 3","refinedsugar","1 November 2023","Let's talk about the 'Equalizer' series. The bread 'n butter is great acting mixed with a moral brand of action featuring a formidable villain. Denzel Washington returns for the third entry which doesn't dress itself up with some unnecessary subtitle. The original went foreign for it's villains. The first sequel '2' stayed domestic. Now the whole enterprise has gone overseas, but does it make a difference?Robert McCall (Washington) finds himself down and out in Italy after his latest quest for justice leaves him shot in the back. Recuperating he informs CIA Specialist Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning) about what he unintentionally stumbled on while he grows to love the quiet little fictional city of Altamonte he's in. The people welcome him with their friendly, open arms. Of course, it doesn't take long for the local mob to cross paths with him endangering those he newly cares about.I'll be upfront that I wasn't thrilled when the trailer dropped for this movie and it revealed they were going overseas. I didn't see a need for it and I've sat thru too many movies about a one man army battling the mob. Being in Italy allows for some culture, beautiful sights, but it doesn't affect the underlying elements on a real level. You don't have to go across the pond to deal with issues of corruption, organized crime and terrorism.Like I said this series lives and breathes on good acting, a moral brand of action and good villains. Denzel, Dakota and a cast of relatively unknown Italian actors bring home the drama, but the action takes a while to build and falters once it occurs without stronger villains. They're not developed. One note, cliche. There's not much satisfying weight to the revenge as well. It feels low energy at times.There's a heartful moment at the end that ties the story together full circle, but 'Equalizer 3' doesn't capture the height of the original film. The tone is an improvement from the last entry, but it's still stuck with unremarkable bad guys and story. This entry slides right into generic territory despite itself.","

"The Equalizer 3","kolzgb","4 October 2023","Big Denzel fan, and enjoyed the first 2 instalments of The Equaliser but this one just failed to impress.The main thing for me is that it lacked the same hand-to-hand combat that the first two brought ...there just wasn't enough of it, compared to what we were offered previously.Is it that Denzel is too old for that now? The second movie was only 5 years ago. Tom Cruise in comparison is still going strong and he's only 7 years younger. I suppose at 68, that's quite old, but I don't know, that's what stunt doubles are for, right?Anyway, it was disappointing. A lot more gun use this time than real fighting, which is what made Equalizer great.","

This second installment felt short in delivering the same product as the story had less depth and was less effective. This third installment was better than second one. In this one, they focused more on drama and less on action.The screenplay was good, the direction was simple and the performances also ranged from average to good. Denzel's performance was good like the original and it was sufficient to make this simple story more effective.Overall, the movie was enjoyable and you should definitely give this movie a try.","

"The Equalizer 3","paah1944","6 September 2023","Denzel Washington does not make crook movies I have never seen him in anything even mediocre. This effort is slow to catch fire. It is no John Wick more the Jason Bourne style. Denzel uses his facials to get his message through. The collection of bad guys well placed and they all look uber fit. A few old gems used to best effect. A predictable ""Taken"" style retribution is the go. The savagery is eked out at the right pace. As usual Denzel often bites his lip to message body electrics. It is pleasing that the good guys do not end up being the bad guys for a change. The array of painful but effective weapons is as expected in this one. Photography was not real crisp with dark blue hues. A fitting finale to this trilogy. The end is a think back and memorable

A real 'Whoa!!' moment and I was expecting a '3 months earlier' thing but no ... the story carries right along.Obviously our intrepid hero doesn't die but finds his way into the hearts of the prettiest little Italian village and it's occupants - or vice versa. The characters that become his friends are all just ... lovely.His battle with the local mafia to protect the village and it's occupants isn't really anything new but, as always, is very well done. My only negative comment is that it somehow seemed a little bit too easy.There's not as much 'action' per se in this movie. Denzel is getting up in years I suppose. Still fabulous.Nice reveal at the end with the CIA woman being a call-back as the daughter of his old boss.Props again for the beautiful Italian location(s). It's a wonderful film to look at, that's for sure.79/100.","

"The Equalizer 3","Amadeus01","4 February 2024","Like everyone else, I watched the first two installments of the franchise so I thought, for completeness, I'll watch the third one.The storyline is ridiculous, the Italian overacting is farcical and, sadly, Denzel is 70 this year, and he does not look younger. He can barely walk, the plot which required him to walk with a cane was probably on purpose.I am sure I will get dunked on by a lot of Denzel fans, Denzel was great in several movies (Philadelphia, Training Day, Crimson Tide) but he was already too old in Equalizer 1. This one is some 10 years later and it's painful to watch. I mean I want to give him a coffee and a cake and a blanket, and not see him implausibly eviscerate a gang of strong looking young men in their twenties.There is a lot more to complain about here but I just leave it here. Good luck to Denzel and his health. Let's get some non-geriatric action movies please?","

I watched it because i was pretty sure about what i was going to see and i was also pretty sure i was going to enjoy it and i was right on both counts.However, there was a little bit of character development. Denzel was visibly older and his character was also. A retiree ready for a place in the sun (literally) where he could rest and live out his golden years.

"The Equalizer 3","dr_ahmed_elshamy","14 September 2023","In the world of cinema, there are those movies that leave you breathless, clinging to the edge of your seat, and ultimately make you believe in the power of good triumphing over evil. The film in question, which we're about to delve into, is one such masterpiece. This movie, an action-packed thriller, has the ability to stun its audience with its compelling portrayal of the eternal battle between good and bad. What's more, the acting in this film is nothing short of spectacular, especially considering its action genre roots. At the heart of this cinematic marvel is the incomparable Denzel Washington, who stands head and shoulders above his contemporaries. To sum it up, I'm thoroughly impressed, and I give it a well-deserved round of applause 👏.One of the most remarkable aspects of this movie is the way it redefines the concept of good triumphing over evil. While this theme is not new to the world of cinema, it's the execution that sets this film apart. From start to finish, the audience is taken on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, with every twist and turn in the plot expertly crafted to keep us on the edge of our seats. The storytelling is nothing short of brilliant, with a narrative that unfolds seamlessly, revealing deeper layers of complexity as the movie progresses.The characters in this film are well-developed and multi-dimensional. Denzel Washington, in particular, delivers a performance that can only be described as awe-inspiring. His portrayal of the protagonist is nothing short of a tour de force. Denzel brings depth, gravitas, and charisma to his character, making us root for him from the very beginning. His ability to convey a wide range of emotions through his acting is truly remarkable, and it's clear that he is in a league of his own when it comes to his craft.What sets Denzel apart from other actors is his consistency in delivering exceptional performances. Over the years, he has built a reputation as one of the greatest actors of our time, and this movie is yet another testament to his talent. His on-screen presence is magnetic, and his ability to command the audience's attention is unmatched. Denzel is a master of his craft, and his performance in this film solidifies his status as a cinematic icon.But it's not just Denzel who shines in this movie. The entire cast delivers stellar performances that complement each other perfectly. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, adding depth and authenticity to the relationships portrayed on screen. The supporting cast members deserve praise for their contributions to the film's success. It's evident that the director and casting team made excellent choices in assembling this ensemble.Now, let's talk about the action sequences. As an action movie, this film delivers in spades. The choreography of the fight scenes is nothing short of breathtaking. The adrenaline-pumping action sequences are a testament to the hard work and dedication of the stunt and effects teams. Every punch, every explosion, and every high-octane moment is executed with precision and flair, keeping the audience thoroughly engaged.In addition to the action, the film also weaves in moments of genuine emotion and introspection. It explores themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the enduring power of the human spirit. These moments of depth and vulnerability add layers to the characters and elevate the film beyond a typical action flick. It's this balance between heart-pounding action and meaningful storytelling that sets this movie apart.The cinematography and visual effects in this film are nothing short of stunning. The camera work is inventive, capturing both the fast-paced action sequences and the quieter, more contemplative moments with equal finesse. The visual effects seamlessly blend with the practical stunts, creating a visually immersive experience for the audience. The attention to detail in every frame is evident, and it's clear that the filmmakers spared no expense in bringing their vision to life.In conclusion, this movie is a triumph on multiple fronts. It redefines the action genre with its compelling storytelling, exceptional acting, and breathtaking visuals. Denzel Washington's performance is a tour de force, reaffirming his status as a cinematic legend. The supporting cast, the action sequences, and the thematic depth all contribute to making this film a must-see.In the end, I'm not just impressed; I'm in awe of what this movie has achieved. It's a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you stunned and deeply satisfied. So, grab your popcorn, buckle up, and get ready for a thrilling ride that you won't soon forget. Bravo to the entire team behind this remarkable film! 👏","

"The Equalizer 3","TharsheyN","15 October 2023","The Equalizer 3 is a thrilling addition to the franchise, and Denzel Washington once again delivers a masterclass in action and character depth. As a longtime fan of the series (Ever since I saw Chloë Grace Moretz in the 1st one), I couldn't be happier with this latest installment. As sad as it is that this is the final film of the series, it ends in a lovely spot for both our hero and the storyline.The storyline is great and keeps the movie moving along at the perfect pace. It ties up the trilogy perfectly while ensuring the film is still fun and enjoyable for all. The movie is engaging and layered, delving into themes of justice, redemption, and the consequences of one's past actions. The film successfully weaves in elements of suspense and mystery, making it more than just another action movie. The pacing is well-balanced, with moments of intense action followed by quieter, character-driven scenes that provide a breather and allow for character development. The cinematography and editing are top-notch, contributing to the overall cinematic experience.Denzel Washington reprises his role as Robert McCall, the ex-CIA operative with a heart of gold. His character's evolution is striking, and this film gives him a chance to showcase both his impeccable combat skills and his emotional depth. Robert's strong moral compass remains the driving force behind the storyline. Denzel without a doubt makes the movie and the trilogy as a whole what it is. The whole Robert McCall having OCD is something Denzel Washington purposely came up with and added to his character.We have Eugenio Mastrandrea playing Gio Bonucci and Dakota Fanning playing Emma Collins (A character that is absolutely critical to the story and trilogy for veteran Equalizer fans). The supporting cast as a whole all do a brilliant job as well, so props to them for ensuring that their character portrayals were also entertaining and convincing.The VFX and SFX is absolutely brilliant and the action sequences are expertly choreographed and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. Director Antoine Fuqua's ability to build tension and deliver intense confrontations is spot on, and The Equalizer 3 is no exception. The fight scenes are visceral and satisfying, combining hand-to-hand combat with the environment and strategic thinking.Overall I give the film a well deserved 9/10. If you're a fan of Denzel Washington and the Equalizer series you will love it. The movie keeps the franchise fresh and exciting, and Denzel's performance reminds us why he's one of the greatest actors of our time. With its compelling characters, well-executed action, and a thought-provoking plot, this film is definitely worth the watch!","

When the end credits rolled ,I didn't feel anything ,just numb.For a start the movie is incredibly slow, unecessarily slow and the whole of the first 10 minute segment didn't even need to happen and had no relevance to the rest of the movie.And then we spend a lot of time with Robert just walking around with a walking stick observing.And where on earth is (and I think you all know what I'm talking about) the classic equaliser soundtrack evident in the first two movies?? It's totally absent.The action sequences are ok, but there's very little in the way of any action and the finale left me wanting more. I just thought, is that it?Dakota Fanning was not very good in this movie either ,very wooden acting and I think another actress, any other actress, would have been more fitting for the part .Horribly disappointed. I don't recommend it. I've rated it 5 out of 10 and I think I'm being a little generous.","

It could get quite gory at some points, but nowhere near the level of action from Denzel that you get in the first two films. Everything seemed to be too easy and it really misses that ""will he, wont he"" thrill.Dakota Fanning's character was pointless and didn't add anything to the plot.","

"The Equalizer 3","DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed","2 September 2023","What an Opening.Here's what I liked about the Film.1. Denzel Washington as always is Excellent, he has multiple bits of Great snappy Dialogue.2. ""I understand Weakness, I understand Pain, I Understand Suffering, I Understand Death and upon Getting to know these people, Im starting to Understand Peace"" - Just Sheer Force and Power From Denzel.3. It was Great to See a Fully Grown Dakota Fanning Reuniting with Denzel in another Film, even some of the Dialogue ""I'll find the Answers and Circle Back to You"". As well as Circling back to Robert McCall with the Answers, She Circles in real life, Back to Denzel Washington from Man on Fire to Equalizer 3 👌4. The Table Scene with Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning, Again, Great dialogue between the two and a Couple of Funny Moments too.5. The Progression of Denzel Slowly Healing over time, going from Terrible Shape, to Decent Shape, to Back to Full Health was Great to See. The Different shots of him going up the Stairs or shots of him just sitting down on a bench for a rest before continuing up the stairs, were nice camera shots, a Nice vibe.6. The overall Cinematography and Camera Angles were Great to See at times.7. The Score was Good in Certain Scenes.8. There are a Couple of Impactful ""Out of Nowhere"" Action Bits, Car Explosion, Van Brutally Ramming a Mafia Member into Wall etc.9. The Opening was So Good, the slow Reveal of the Dead Bodies and the look on that Guys Face as he Walks through slowly, I loved the feel of that scene. It Set Everything In Motion Nicely.Here's what Brings the Film Down -1. The Villain and his Brother are One Dimensional as Hell, no personality or Flavour whatsoever. They are Brutal and that's it, no depth whatsoever.2. The Climax. You call that a Climax? It Just Ends out of Nowhere. The Climax Needed to Be Strong. On top of that, it was a Completely Missed Opportunity. The Script could of had the Villain Written in to Be, walking through the Streets in front of the Whole Village and Paraded around, and the Villagers Finally Get their Revenge.Overall, it was a nice Relaxing Film and if you bear in Mind that this is a Trilogy (Overarching Through Line) whilst watching, with that in Mind, it's not actually Bad, it's ok.","

Denzel's acting is great as we all expect from him. The end of the trilogy is not what I expected and surprisingly a more dramatic way was taken from the team which I liked, but this is subjective. Good directing and good depicting of the relationship between human and god form the director. Photography is very good and special too. This movie left me with some thoughts regarding, what make us live in a place? The people or the place itself? Maybe a combination of these two? I think it's the people though. You should watch and find your answer.","

"The Equalizer 3","mata7-1","8 January 2024","Equalizer 3 stands out from its prequels. It does not have the same kind of tone as the previous films, it doesn't ""set everything up"" before we get to the violent parts, here we seem to skip some character development and instead just go straight to the violent parts.It also doesn't have the same musical score like the previous one, or should I say the same ""kind"" of score. This score lacks gravitas, a lot has to do with the movies missing ""the equalizer"" theme from the first movies. And Harry Gregson-Williams is surprisingly missing from this movie. I'd really love to know what happened. Was Gregson-Williams just busy, was he tired of the movies or did the relationship with the director sour? This movie really suffer because of the exclusion of Gregson-Williams' score.I do not think this was a fitting end to the Equalizer story. I would rather like to forget that this movie even exists. But, it does have Denzel Washington in it, so there's that.","

"The Equalizer 3","dh-51489","16 October 2023","The director absolutely nailed this, the third - and apparently last outing - for Denzel Washington as Robert McCall.Deciding to get straight into it, rather than waste time on some sort of origin explanation, we see the aftermath of an entanglement with The Equalizer. Any disappointed you might feel for being cheated out of the action is quickly laid to rest, as McCall promptly lays everyone still alive to rest - bar one. And this triggers - forgive the pun - the situation that leads to the film's main storyline.I started this review by claiming that the director nailed this and I'd like to elaborate. While The Equalizer franchise is about action, it's even more about the satisfaction that comes with brutal justice. The director not only does a fantastic job of capturing the heart and soul of provincial Italy, he also provides us with characters you absolutely loath, leaving you chomping at the bit to see how and when McCall is going to 'punish' them for their bad behaviour. This balancing act between building the frustration that comes with tyranny - and the satisfactory release felt when justice is dealt - is a genuine credit to the director.The only thing I don't like about this film is the thought that it was the last.","

"The Equalizer 3","movieman6-413-929510","3 September 2023","The Equalizer 3 Is the third film Equalizer film of the series and is again directed by Antoine Fuqua, who also directed the two previous films.During his latest mission, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is injured and cared for by Italian doctor Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone). Since then he has been recovering in the village of Altamonte in Sicily. In this way he has built up a relationship with the people of the village.Robert later learns that some residents are being oppressed by the mob. To thank the inhabitants for the help they have given him, he tries to protect them against these mafia figures.With this third Equalizer film, Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington return for what is probably the last time in this film series. The second Equalizer movie was a bit unclear due to the lesser story, because there were several separate storylines in that movie. The Equalizer also tried to help different people, with different things. Fortunately, this third Equalizer has a more focused story. Because the Equalizer is more recovering, this film does have a slower story. For example, Robert does more research into mafia cases than he really tries to counter them right away. This happens more towards the end of the film, but then the pace suddenly picks up quickly. Despite a more focused story, this third film has a slower pace. The film has its long-winded moments.Robert also collects more information for the CIA and then passes it on to CIA agent Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning). Their cooperation just doesn't really come forward as if they really are a mutual team. After Robert passes on the clues, the CIA only seems to catch the criminals more or make their actions more public to the world. The isolated CIA scenes seem a bit unnecessary.Unfortunately, the relationships that Robert has built up with the various inhabitants of Altamore are not all equally strong. As a result, some of these relationships and characters may interest you a little less during the film. Fortunately, Denzel Washington plays the role of the Equalizer well and charismatically, but like the character he is more elderly and recovering.They also show nicely the Italian environments and culture. Many Italian characters are therefore played more by Italian actors, who also continue to speak more Italian.","

I personally enjoyed the unaware frighting scenes that came with the theater sound,It's nothing compared to a tv sound.And Denzel acting all helpless old man and later killing mercylessly is truly enjoying.But the villain of Equalizer 3 didn't bring any challenge to Denzel in fact no one lay a finger on him in the entire movie. The god mode wasn't effective cause the villain was a joke.Other than that it's not a bad movie but they could have done better.","

"The Equalizer 3","mitch-anthony","6 September 2023","I love Denzel but poor scriptwriting let him down and spoilt the movie. It was a disappointing end to a overall good trilogy. You have to suspend a certain amount of belief to think that ageing and wounded ex CIA assassin McCall can single handedly defeat the Sicilian Mafia. With that in mind I embarked on Equalizer 3. Yeah he's a trained killer, but c'mon. He takes out the crime family younger brother with relative ease, faces off with the older brother and is saved by the locals who intervene with harsh words and phone video (of course real mafioso would just kill him or kidnap him, as they had the police in their pocket!). Then McCall takes the initiative to covertly infiltrate the older brothers heavily guarded mansion. How you ask? Clever hacking of the security system? No, he lets off a car alarm and enters the mansion grounds after easily overpowering ONE guard. Next scene he's actually in the building and takes a few guards out with no real resistance. Poor, poor, lazy scriptwriting and sums up lazy $$$ sequels. I'll fondly remember Eq 1 & 2 but 3 only gets a 5/10 from me.","

"The Equalizer 3","martin_merelesc","14 October 2023","I liked it a lot!!! Since I can't stand injustice, it seems very good to me that someone defends good people. Each of his movies has been different for me, even though he has played the avenger in all of them. This one is not boring at all, as I have read in some reviews. Let's see it's not James Bond, nor Mission Impossible, it has some action, but the good thing about this movie is what Denzel does, his heart, his feelings...
Although sometimes it is too violent, but there are people who only understand violence. With this I don't want to justify it, but there are people so bad, so bad that they mess with the most vulnerable who deserve the worst. Another thing: do they speak Italian? But in what country have they seen it? In Spain there are subtitles every time they speak Italian, and even so I think it is perfectly understood. And Dakota Fanning is glad to see her older than in Thirst for Vengeance. Also, the place where the film takes place, ""beautiful"" and makes you really want to visit it, with or without a fight included. Too bad it's the last one in the Saga.","

"The Equalizer 3","alindsayal","7 September 2023","I have enjoyed the previous Equalizer films and finally we have a third film in this franchise and possibly the final film of the trilogy and here is my review for The Equalizer 3. The premise of the film sees McCall end up in Southern Italy where he becomes a part of the community, it ends up this community is run by the mafia which springs him into action.Main Character
Denzel Washington once again reprises his role as Robert McCall and he is fantastic. I feel like there are few true movie stars left and Denzel is one of them and oozes charisma in this role. He is believable in both the nice guy and as this menacing killing machine. This film is truly elevated by the performance of Denzel Washington and I am glad he agreed to do this film.Supporting Characters
Dakota Fanning plays a CIA agent and she is good in the role, she has good chemistry with Washington and it is nice to once again see her acting. Her role and character aren't particularly interesting but Fanning is good here.The rest of the cast suffer a bit though, everyone just feels incredibly generic with no character. All the people, protagonists and antagonists in Italy are by the numbers and they offer very little to this film, though everyone is really trying their best.Story
The story is okay, I do like the story that involves the development of Robert McCall and it is always fun seeing Denzel Washington taking down bad guys in the pursuit of justice. It is just a bit like we go through the motions here and don't get much that is new here. Plus they have a story involving terrorists and it brings Dakota Fanning's character into the film and it doesn't need to be here, it doesn't really affect the film and I wonder what the whole point of it was.Script
The script is functional, there are some alright dramatic scenes and humour, though I think it was raised by Denzel Washington's performance. There isn't much meat here and it dulls it down to your pretty generic action film.Style
This film is easily the most violent of the trilogy and when the action is taking place it is very cool and seeing Washington take down these mobsters is very fun. But the pacing of the film is a bit all over the place, after the first action sequence there is a big lull and it really took me out of the film.Overall
Overall, The Equalizer 3 is an above average film. It is one of those generic action films that works well for the fans of the franchise but isn't one that you need to rush out and see.Rating - 6/10.","

"The Equalizer 3","liav1609","6 November 2023","The first 2 movies PACKED action scenes, and this one had barely 2-3 of them...
I don't know why and who decided that this is a good idea to cut the MAIN idea of The Equalizer - ACTION SCENES! But it definitely ruined most the movie (pretty sure not only for me as I can see lots of comments with these complains).Also BTW with the ending being too soft for my opinion, even my girlfriend asked where is the action from the 1+2 movies and that the movie bored her a little too.The story is good, finally we can see him gets his rest and the quiet he was looking for.And because of the story - Im giving it 6-7, if more action scenes were made in this movie it was easily a 8 stars.I love Denzel by the way.","

"The Equalizer 3","rahulramanuj","9 September 2023","As much as I really wanted to enjoy the latest Denzel Washington blockbuster I was left with an underwhelming feeling on the whole.He was absolutely fantastic as usual, delivered brutal blows when needed and gave a slightly softer feel to the film. Where I feel it lacked were the other characters and also the storyline was too good to be true. The dialogue was decent and scenery was beautiful throughout in Sicily. Maybe I expected too much but it was nowhere near as good as the Equaliser 1 and in general films 9-10 years ago were a lot better than they are now. I'd give it a solid 6/10 but it was nothing special. Denzel was breathtaking as always though. 🤘🏽👌🏼","

"The Equalizer 3","timitimitimi-9-302238","9 October 2023","Alright, here's my take on ""Equalizer 3"":Equalizer 3 is a film that, quite frankly, misses the mark on multiple fronts. While it aims to be a high-octane action thriller, it ends up being a lackluster installment that neither thrills nor engages the audience. Denzel Washington returns as Robert McCall, but even his stellar acting can't save this sinking ship.The script is riddled with clichés and predictable plot points, making it feel like a recycled version of its predecessors. There's a palpable absence of tension or stakes, and the characters feel one-dimensional. It's as if the filmmakers took the formula that worked in the first two films and diluted it to the point of irrelevance.The action sequences, which should be the film's highlight, are marred by shoddy choreography and uninspiring cinematography. Gone is the slick, visceral feel of the original, replaced by disjointed set pieces that seem to have been thrown together last minute.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the lack of character development. McCall remains largely the same from start to finish, making the entire ordeal feel pointless. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, serving as mere pawns in a poorly executed game.In summary, Equalizer 3 is a disappointing addition to what could have been a compelling franchise. It feels like a cash grab that disrespects not only its audience but also the legacy of the films that came before it. If you're looking for an action-packed, emotionally engaging thriller, I'd suggest skipping this one and revisiting the original.So yeah, not a fan. Would not recommend.","

"The Equalizer 3","tresm87","31 August 2023","2014 was a massive year for the action genre. 2 films that people really didn't see coming reignited a somewhat dormant and overdone genre. John Wick and then The Equalizer. These powerhouse hits full of classic action and legendary Iconic performances by well established actors brought the genre back to near 90s action levels. Near a decade later both franchises are still going strong.The Equalizer 3 brings all the ballistics and escapades Denzel has dabbled in and maybe even more this time around. The changes are more within the new settings than anything and that could be for the worse imo. Not saying the visuals aren't astounding, but the plotting changes because of the exotic locations may have watered down the story overall. We have seen enough mafia themed films to where it can cheapen the product at this point.Aside from that nitpick, it's still a very serviceable and exciting sequel with another great performance by the legend himself. Definitely doesn't break new ground like the first film, but it offers another chapter in the equalizer story.","

"The Equalizer 3","richzytko","18 December 2023","Denzel is the man. The third installment did not leave you unfulfilled. Set in beautify Italy, who didn't want to instantly be transformed there. And the hospitality and charm and the melodic language - I'm selling my house in NJ and moving there!What a shame that la familia is in Sicily! Who would have thought.Robert McCall still kicking. Those stairs! My knee hurts just thinking of it. While convalescing he sees a shake down that rapidly escalates into a one-man war. Every local is intimidated and compromised yet gathers around their new friend. Lots of graphic bloody broken bone scenes, glass shards to the face - he made his point. Overall a good action packed movie lead by everyone's favorite actor - Denzel Washington.","

"The Equalizer 3","whitetowel-74786","4 October 2023","I don't usually bother with money spinning third instalments but hey, movie pickings are slim and it's Denzel and Dakota reuniting some 20 years after the excellent 'Man on Fire'. Wish i hadn't bothered tbh, this Equalizer bookend mostly fires blanks.Of course Denzel is as brilliant as ever in the starring role, the all-Italian scenery is stunning and the (albeit) few and far between action scenes are well executed (and graphic), but that's about all. The story itself is slow, talky and lacking in genuine thrills, spills and intensity. The screenplay is cliched, uneventful and wholly predictable (Italy>crime>mafia>retribution - yawn) but most annoying is that literally half the film is in subtitled Italian dialogue, which is way ott and detracts from the overall viewing experience. I found myself fast forwarding after a while as the lacklustre proceedings dragged on like an extended audience with the Pope.Yep, all in all it's a disappointing one-watch end to the trilogy that's for completists and Denzel afficinados only. Back to the three Godfather classics it is then... Arrivederci Mr Washington.","

"The Equalizer 3","djrmc24","21 November 2023","The Equalizer 3 is one of those rare sequels that is actually better then the original. The story is strong in this 3rd outting. Denzel is better then ever and kicks total butt in this film. This movie see's our main hero trying to lead a quiet life in a small town in Italy but things start to turn south when local thugs disrupt that peaceful life. I think this movie works so well because it prioritizes the story over mindless action. Speaking of the action it is in your face and very brutal. The beginning of the film reminded me something that we see in a horror film with the carnage that is laid out. You can tell that Denzel really enjoys playing this part and has great chemistry with the Director. The Equalizer 3 is a really solid film and not just an action film but a film with a lot of heart at it's core. The Equalizer 3 gets a high 8 stars out of 10 from me. The best of the Equalizer movie series.","

"The Equalizer 3","PANDIAN120621","4 October 2023","Denzel is Undoubtedly the one of the greatest male actors of our generation gives a rich layered,charismatic & captivating performance without being too formulaic...
The action sequences are well choreographed with a touch of morbid and the opening sequence was innovative and the memorable one...but denzel slays the entire mafia with no challenge to his skills as there is no formidable enemy was a big drawback...
Onthe otherhand a one man army taking on a mob plot was well handled by director with sensible screenplay and camera by robert richardson captures the coastal Italy(Altmonte) is soothing enough to elevate the movie...
The conversation between doctor & denzel about good and bad man is a memorable dialogue that holds the soul of the movie...

"The Equalizer 3","mka-net","8 October 2023","This movie was just as good as the first two Equalizer movies. It reminds me of the way action movies used to be before Hollywood switched to cringe all-women-power movies that nobody wants to watch.I'm not going to spoil much. Just note that the movie is action-packed from beginning to end. Instead of focusing on artificially inserting progressive political talking points and too much CGI, it focuses on just making a great action movie.I kind of makes me a little sad that Denzel Washington is one of the last reminding great actors from the 90's movies. I'm hoping that Hollywood will go back to making great action movies like this again.","

"The Equalizer 3","Movie_Beta","17 November 2023","I must admit, I really enjoy Denzel Washington movies and these Equaliser movies in particular. There is something satisfying seeing a pretty average looking guy standing up with vigilante justice for the little guy.Before starting this movie, a quick glance at the runtime shows it is the shortest of the trilogy at well under 2hrs runtime, which was not necessarily a negative, as modern cinema too often seems to go for 'bigger is better' mentality. That being said, we do lose some depth in this third part of the trilogy. There is no getting to know the characters of the village and their back stories and motivation. It's all very superficial.The movie does kind of break the normal sequence of things as the first scenes throw is right in at the deep end within moments of the start, and which in fact could have been the 'end' of another movie. The locations and scenery are wonderful and we get the feel of an old Sicilian village. Though as said previously, the pace just moves too fast for the viewer to appreciate and understand the setting and it's inhabitants.Action wise we get more than expected, with some really gory deaths, and a high body count for the bad guys. The final confrontation comes about too quickly really and has some Scarface influence in the extravagantly decorated mafia villa. The final scenes throws in one last twist and ties up this series nicely and ends it on a high. Enjoyable action thriller.8/10.","

Denzel Washington is very good in this role, he succed in giving his character a redemption qualities.

"The Equalizer 3","mattpberinger","29 November 2023","As a fan of the first 2 movies, I eagerly anticipated a sequel that could deliver action and excitement while delving into the intricate world of the Italian mafia. Unfortunately, this movie falls dramatically short of expectations, robbing the viewers of any suspense or surprise, and turning the story into a tedious, uninspiring slog.Denzel takes a vacation in Italy, drinks tea most of the time, shoots some mobsters for a few flashing minutes. Yes these brief shooting scenes are gory, yes they are cool. Wow what a compelling plot.No building action, no originality whatsoever. For most of the time he walks in old and dark alleys, and drinks tea while talking with totally shallow characters with a narrative so uneventful that it barely registers. The relentless gloom and doom, and the predictability of the actions leave the viewer feeling drained rather than engaged or entertained.Another major drawback is the over-reliance on Italian language and English subtitles. While I understand and appreciate the desire for authenticity in language, the execution here is cumbersome. The subtitles dominate most of the screen time, often distracting from the visual storytelling. This constant back-and-forth between reading and viewing disrupts the cinematic experience, making it hard to immerse oneself in the film's world.The cinematography, though potentially a redeeming feature here, only adds to the film's woes. The director's choice to shroud every scene in darkness might have been intended to create a moody atmosphere, but it instead results in a visually monotonous and overwhelmingly depressing experience.While I like the actor, this movie is a disappointing addition to the mafia genre, and it's definitely not on my re-watch list.","

Apart from Denzel and Dakota the acting is 3rd class , some scenes you would expect to see in a cheap video film. In my opinion platforms like n.flix, pr.me....etc are ruining the cinema trade for everyone. Equalizer 3 is a forgettable and unnecessary film. The plot is predictable, The only thing that saves the film from being a complete disaster is Denzel Washington's performance, However, even he can't save this film.","

"The Equalizer 3","zarcos-01818","4 February 2024","So first thing. If some retired stranger in the USA didn't have his bank account hacked, this story wouldn't have been. Ok, I'll take that.The movie starts with Robert, or Roberto as he calls himself later, having done some killing in a winery in Sicily, gets shot by a kid, is then picked up and finds a temporary peace in a quaint town, until the Arab terrori....no, the mafia shows up and ruins his day. And now he's got to deal with that.And here I thought that Robert was going to take the entire organisation head on.But no, he had help and he just took care of the locals, mafia style. Stabbing and choking and all sorts of torture methods.Speaking of which, I couldn't help but feel that the blatant references to the godfather movies were out of place, even if the events happen in Sicily.I mean as I mentioned, the stabbing and choking with a wire, the alternation between a death and a celebration scene, the traditional pasta meal, down to what looks like the beheaded horse in the bed scene!Too much really.But, in the end, it was a fairly entertaining movie, well executed I might say, for what it is.

"The Equalizer 3","Padi_2704","9 September 2023","""The Equalizer 3"" may have guaranteed an extreme activity pressed insight, yet it left me with blended sentiments. Even though it had its good points, there were parts of the movie that made me want more.First of all, the level of violence in some scenes surprised me. It is essential to note that this franchise has never shied away from violence; however, there have been times when it has felt excessive and gratuitous, which has hampered the viewing experience as a whole.The plot of the film, while fascinating in parts, didn't necessarily in every case draw an obvious conclusion durably. There were times when the narrative appeared to veer off course or introduced subplots that did not fully support the main plot. I was left with unanswered questions and the impression of missed storytelling opportunities as a result of this occasional lack of coherence.Surprisingly, ""The Equalizer 3"" also lacked the high-octane action scenes that series fans have come to expect. Given the establishment's standing for its extraordinary and innovative activity, this felt like a botched an open door to convey the energy that watchers expected.Finally, the peak of the film left me fairly unsatisfied. The simplicity with which Denzel Washington defeated the primary bad guy felt excessively great. It lacked the struggle and tension that typically distinguish such confrontations. A seriously difficult and sincerely charged standoff might have raised the film's general effect.Eventually, ""The Equalizer 3"" had its minutes, a brilliant cast, beautiful shots, Denzel Washington in the main role is really good, great acting and enthusiasts of the series might in any case track down angles to appreciate. Notwithstanding, the film's unnecessary ruthlessness, periodic story irregularities, a deficiency of activity, and a disappointing finale might leave a few watchers feeling that it missed the mark concerning its true capacity.","

Denzel Washington embodies this role perfectly. His demeanor, his facial expressions, his mannerisms. He is the exact fit for this role, I find myself wondering what watching a young Denzel (Training Day) play this role would be like.Now to the actual movie, I loved the start, the suspense was great and I liked how it came back full circle at the end with similar fight scenes. Speaking of which, the fight scenes were spot on and took me right back to the first movie. However, it was just too little and easy. I wish they had created more. Come to think of it, I think there were only 3 fight scenes in the entire movie. That sucks..It was great seeing Dakota back on the screens alongside Denzel. I think the script was too simple, which was a let down, considering the type of actor Denzel is. But it didn't really matter much because the cinematography was spot on. I just couldn't get my eyes off the screen the whole time. I seriously wouldn't mind watching this a couple more times.","

Not only is it trademark Equalizer, it's set in the most gorgeous Italian village, which lends the whole atmosphere an effective religious backdrop. The deep faith, kindness and joy of the local people gives an extra heart to this third in the franchise. The plot is 'Equalizer' formulaic, fortunately, because it's what we come to the series to see: Denzil reluctantly takes on some bad guys and it doesn't end well for them.This one is a delightfully slow build, from an explosive and slightly confusing start. About five minutes in I was wondering if I'd come into the film halfway through. Fear not, all is revealed.I cannot recommend this film too highly. It's absolutely perfect entertainment. It's got heart, beauty, grace, and courage. And lots of violence, gore and well-earned retribution for evil-doers. What more could anyone want?","

Or even have the girl Agent join him a little in the fight.Very disappointing. Not worth the time to watch.","

"The Equalizer 3","KFstudios2009","20 September 2023","The Equalizer 3 is the weakest chapter in The Equalizer franchsie. I enjoyed this movie a bit, but I have to admit, this was like a simple remake. The same things that happened in the previous movies, happens the same in this one. He kill some people, the other got mad, they try to kill him and he tries to kill them. The same things happen in every movie, and in the first one, it worked, but the two last ones, didn't work, unfortunately. Denzel Washington is once again back as the secret character Robert (or Roberto), that search for peace. The movie started like if something new is going to happen, but no. Just the same stuff. New mafia, new location, the good things about this Equalizer was the filming locations and camera-work, nice pictures, and they introduced Robert's new friends good and I could understand that Robert have found peace in Italy. The action sequences was weak, they could have more fighting and less just killing. This movie didn't do a good job about that. And really, if they didn't wrote ""The Final Chapter"" I would never thought that this was the final chapter, as this is the grand finaly, I expected something extrarordinary, since this is the end. Could end more complete and they could do something that I really could think that this was the end. But it ended the same way, all of the Equalizer movies are build up in the same freaking way. That is annoying, because you know when everything is going to happen. Robert was once again the not so known character, you don't know who he really is, and since this is the finale, I would like to know some more about this character, but in the end, The Equalizer trilogy is closed, and we might never find out who Robert really is, and who he was after all. So, to summary, The Equalizer 3: The Final Chapter, was the weakest chapter, many uncomplete elements, and I expected something way better. For fans of action and suspense, this might be a good one, but it was a little boring, too. I really want to like this movie but unfortunately, this wasn't the best. Fifty-fifty, in the middle.","

"The Equalizer 3","nightringer-76840","5 October 2023","Now this is what The Equalizer is about. A retired assassin solving refular people's problem because the perpetrators are powerful devourers of others.The beauty pf Fuqua's vision of Robert McCall stays the same with the trilogy. Denzel successfully took over and embodied what the modern day The Equalizer looks, acts, and specific style of problem solving. He is silent, swift, well timed and deadly. He comes and leaves without any warning nor sound, while bad guys' bodies are scattered all over the place.Equalizer 3 has a very different cinematic approach that wrapped The Equalizer Trilogy. The assassination were done without any fancy dance nor violence, but swift and direct deadly hit that ended the life of the bad guys. It was a masterpiece art of death.Denzel looks is at the right age of Retirement, making this 3rd installment easy to digest. And RM principle of not wasting unnecessary life, almoat killed him in the process, which he gladly took as part of the necessary progress of his action.However, that became his blessing coz he found a place to call home and a partner to equalize his mission for the future in the reunion with Dakota Fanning.Don't sleep on it, The Equalize 3 is a must see.","

"The Equalizer 3","Lord-Voltemort","10 January 2024","First 5 mins were good. They should have stayed with that story line or even made that the end scene and told the story leading up to it. But they didnt and the opening scene becomes a way for them to basically bring the CIA into the movie and cast Dakota Fanning prob for some Denzel plus Dakota reunion marketing. She really serves no purpose for the actual plot. The real ""Big Bad"" ends up being The Camorra mafia and he fights them because they shake down this town that he's become partial too. Ok fine, if that's your super simple revenge story plot, great. None of us are gonna care that much about it but we're here for the ass kicking. So you gotta pack your story with ass kicking to make up for the lack of interesting story. This does neither. No action happens for about an hour. The bulk of the film. If you're going to make his adversaries incompetent idiots that he goes through like butter, there must be a lot of them. Like 50-100 of them like in most John Wicks. And don't build up a bad guy as being some super bad ass mean guys that are a threat to be reconned with only to have this 70 year old man go through them all in 5 mins without breaking a sweat and not in any sort of interesting way. I gave it a 5 because Denzel is cool. Otherwise, it's a 2-3 because this should be the easiest movie to pull off. Its super low hanging fruit. When in doubt, make it kick ass and bare minimum it's a 6.5.","

"The Equalizer 3","ak-40376","18 September 2023","If you have seen all the equaliser films, then you will know that this is one and few on its own. It was good from start to finish. Storyline was amazing Denzel Washington is an amazing actor as always no matter what film or storyline he tends to do. It always tends to be an absolute incredible film. Whether you like this type of film or you don't, it's a must see if you've seen all of the equaliser films, the ending is so good and I do not want to give it away or spoil it. Make sure you stay to the very end to see the ending all in all. This was an incredible film and that's why it's got full stars.","

"The Equalizer 3","cosby_don","9 January 2024","Honestly ... I left out of the theatre (my living room) feeling inspired to visit Italy and adding red wine to my list of things to do for my mental health in 2024. Seriously, the wine just looked so good in that scene where the townspeople were watching a movie on one of the buildings.I also left feeling that that town was POPPING. Sure it was peaceful but there are beautiful, friendly women and waitresses just walking around and sparking up conversations with strangers (who wouldn't want to live somewhere like that!), fireworks, soccer teams winning and celebrations, religious nights with candles, friendly doctors that provide help to anyone 24/7... I mean I could go on and on. Does this type of place actually exist? And do I mention as a Black man myself that no one called Denzel a slur in the whole movie? Even the bad guys... That's it! I'm packing my bags!As for the story-meh, very cliche. The bad guy? Meh, not scary and cried like a school girl at the end. Oh, and the female CIA agent-I'm sorry but her acting was atrocious. She was not believable in that role at all unfortunately. And the violence? Very gratuitous, but nothing I haven't scene before in a movie. It wasn't shot differently or creative, ya know?I did like the pace of the movie. It felt like an actual movie movie, like in the old days, aka 90's. But the story deserves better.","

"The Equalizer 3","yesiwantpineappleonthat","9 October 2023","This is sooooo bad.Youve got old man Denzel showing them youngsters 'how its done son', and its so cringy.Zoned out at the ""bad boys motorcycle club"" scene, and didnt make it past the 40min mark. My eyeballs literally rolled out of their sockets by this point.Its slow, its pretentious, its completely out of touch and just who is this film intended for? Its slow, it meanders, just like Denzel taking the stairs.Majority of the characters are simply 'yes men' or part of the 'Denzel cult', cant outshine the aging star in this one.Atleast the new Indiana jones film although horrible, wasnt so full of itself like this movie is, just avoid completely.","

"The Equalizer 3","gilleliath","18 February 2024","You can see a mile off that this was made with Italian film grants: it's set in this fantasy Italy, superbly picturesque, in which everything is relaxed and everybody is super-nice and nurturing - except the bad guys, of course. You know, everything that kinda reminds you of what really matters in life. Just the place for your next hols. Less understandably, since there is no obvious link to Australia, it got Australian money too (presumably they had some Australian crew).Like Liam Neasden with his 'certain set of skills', Denzel Washington has established his action persona with a success that would have seemed unlikely earlier in his career; but here he only gets a few fun moments with it, and the finale is decidedly underwhelming. I was convinced there must be another scene to come, but no. Compared to the other two it lacks impact. If, as he says, he is happy for this to be the last of the series, it suggests that he doesn't take its legacy terribly seriously.On the plus side, it's a welcome surprise to see Catholic imagery play so big a part in a film, positively, without any sense of irony or any attempt to exploit it sensationally. I'm only a little disappointed that we didn't at some point get to see McColl reading the Summa Theologiae in Latin or something. He's so brainy, you know!","

"The Equalizer 3","Lewis_Heather787","4 November 2023","Well I certainly wasn't expecting this! I'll be honest I was really not bothered or that enthusiastic to watch the third instalment in the ""Equalizer"" franchise. The first two films for me where average/ok at best and to be honest I have completely forgotten about them. So going into this one, I wasn't expecting much.Wow am I glad that I gave it a chance because this is easily the best instalment in the trilogy, by a long way. I believe there are 3 reasons why this succeeds over the other 2 films. They are tone, location and story. All of those 3 elements are massively improved upon and elevate this film, plus keep it a more interesting/compelling watch. The tone is so much more grounded and darker in this film than the previous and it suits the main character and story so much better. Not saying the other films are light hearted comedies, no but this one certainly feels more grittier. Its also helped by using Italy as the main location of the film, its a gorgeous country and it pairs beautifully together with the thriller genre. Lastly, story. This story is much more interesting and grandiose than the others whilst still remaining serious and not caricature in any way. I loved the vibe the whole through and the story has a nice completion to it as well that doesn't feel forced.Even though I really enjoyed the film, is it a masterpiece? No. Is it going to break any boundaries within film or the genre? Also no. However, its just a really solid film to watch that is good. Nothing wrong film a film just being good, maybe thats its maximum potential. 70% out of 100.","

"The Equalizer 3","jb_campo","11 September 2023","I loved Equalizer 1, while #2 was less good. But the third in this trilogy reached new depths of violence.The story is somewhat of a mystery with Robert in Italy but you don't know why. You see his trademark of dead bodies in a villa, but why?The mystery evolves and he ends up injured and dying on the Amalfi coast until this kind-hearted old doctor saves his life. You then have the usual suspects - Robert grows to make friends in the village and sees the mafia doing bad things to good people. So, he stops them, quickly and efficiently, and brutally.The CIA gets involved. Denzel has nice interactions with CIA agent Dakota Fanning. How she gets out into the field is a mystery, but whatever. They play cat and mouse with some great dialogs. We get to a fitting conclusion of good vs evil.This story rocks because the dialog is excellent. The music, especially that DJ type music when things are about to go crazy, adds to the drama. It also storms in the final confrontation, similar to EQ2's hurricane. The dark symbolism is impactful. Explosions, old ways to kill, new ways to kill and inflict pain. EQ3 amps up the pain and the story.Will this be the last Equalizer? Who knows. But if so, Robert is hopefully living peacefully at last in a quiet Italian town drinking tea and having the rest he deserves and earned.I loved EQ3 - and - if you are a Denzel fan - I think you will enjoy it too.",NA
"The Equalizer 3","movies_are_life_","2 September 2023","Having never seen the prior Equalizer movies, I went into the third with expectations of knowing generally what type of film and what type of character to expect. What I got was mostly what I expected, but also a bit of surprise at how a slow character building drama was the focus rather than a focus on the violence. This might be a detriment for some, but was refreshing for me and suited the story and age of Denzel Washington.Like any good script, major questions are answered as the film goes on. It's deliberate slower pace lets the audience think about the dialogue and interactions between the characters in this homely neighborhood in Italy. Watching Denzel slowly recover from a wound gives us the time to figure out who he really is. Not having prior knowledge of the first two movies, I wanted to know (just like his new friend Enzo) whether he was a good or bad guy. Although Enzo knows this answer from the start, Denzel's Robert McCall (two C's and 2 L's) figures this out as the people around him accept him for who he is and not what his past life was.The only issue is the addition of the CIA. It was either a plot that was reduced or added. Either way, it shouldn't have even been in the film. It's a build-up of additional action that leads nowhere. I would rather have Dakota Fanning playing her character from Man on Fire and have a shocking twist that McCall is really Creasy! There's a sort of budding relationship that doesn't have a sense of direction and the villains are not strong enough. Even though it could've been better, what we get is still a good watch and a worthy send off to a character who realizes a tragic death doesn't have to be the end.",NA
"The Equalizer 3","alexandros-niklan","4 October 2023","While we have been used to watch action pack Denzel , killing literally on the clock, this ones is unusually good.Even though actions is present only in some scenes, the story is great, it keeps you through the movie to check what will happen. Twists also exists in plot in addition to one very strong feature. Denzel is a ruthless assassin which is very clear in these few action scenes.Very well filmed, good acting even from small role actors, nice soundtrack and a pretty good ending for these series.My suggestion is to watch it, enjoy it cause this one shows a way on how to end a movies series and not fail any expectations.",NA
"The Equalizer 3","ariqakbar","20 October 2023","Compare to the other movie, this start to feel that we already knew the formula. The sequence. Become a little bit predictable.I was only waiting for the scene that i already knew will coming, rather than excited to see what's going to happened. They do something about the phase of the story so we can build more emotion. Personally for me ""the equalizer"" that i expected is already there, but as a new movie this one doesn't really held the expectation from this huge sequel.Overall this entire movie was kinda carried by denzel alone, he's doing all the works. Some of protagonist characters have great performance but the rest was simply pretty normal.",NA
"The Equalizer 3","timeblank","21 September 2023","Denzel embodies a unique brand of action hero. He serves as the antidote to malignant criminals who believe they can freely terrorize innocent townsfolk with their savage gangster ways.The true brilliance of The Equalizer 3 lies in Denzel's ability to strike fear into the hearts of these criminals. When a community showers you with care and happiness, you'll stop at nothing to shield them from harm, preserving their lives and well-being.What captivates me about this film is its portrayal of the villain, whose despicable acts lead to the loss of innocent lives. When their paths intersect with Denzel's, the real excitement begins. It forces them to reconsider their actions and ensures they won't make the same mistake again. Truly an exceptional movie!",NA
"The Equalizer 3","saaurabhsharma","8 September 2023","Equalizer 3, sadly, falls short of expectations and concludes the series on a disappointing note. Surprisingly, the film lacks the intense physical action sequences we've come to associate with the Equalizer films; they make up only a paltry 5-10 minutes of the film's runtime featuring Denzel Washington.The majority of the movie is dominated by a slow build-up and an excess of unnecessary subplots, making the pacing feel sluggish.The worst part of the movie was its one sided climax that disappoints with a subpar and underwhelming action set piece. It's almost anticlimactic as our hero, hiding in shadows, swiftly kills the entire gang while they sleep, leaving you wanting for a more engaging showdown.Equalizer 3 certainly had potential, but it ultimately falls short of delivering the excitement and closure we had hoped for in this supposed finale.",NA
"The Equalizer 3","emirfithri-12517","7 October 2023","The satisfaction of watching this movie is absolute high. Rarely we find a third sequel that tops the previous 2 movies. Almost none. But Equalizer 3 did just that.The satisfaction mostly comes from how quickly and easily Bobby terminated the Mafia's brother and the gang. I found myself clapping after he killed Marco, and raising both of my hands in the air. What a legend! Only Denzel can pull off something heroic like this.Bobby then proceeded to provoke the Mafia boss, till he came face to face with Bobby, and swearing he would return and kill Bobby and burn the whole town.Obviously, the Mafia didn't and wouldn't expect Bobby right in the same night. Bobby goes to their lair and wipe them out. The Mafia leader gets a taste of his own medicine.What an epic heroic movie. I feel like we really could use an Equalizer. Because wherever we are there is always bullies, oppressing others for their own gain.Hands down the best movie in 2023.",NA
"The Equalizer 3","AzSumTuk","6 October 2023","Pros - great scenery. Two nicely choreographed fight scenes.Cons - everything else. The soundtrack is just horrible. The action scenes are few and far in between. Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning are, to put it mildly, underused. The writing is simply atrocious - and I'm saying this as someone who loved the previous two movies.Do you remember the previous two movies? You know, the ones where Denzel Washington was always helping those around him? He wasn't a big-time superhero saving the world, he was just... helping people. He'd train his coworker to pass the physical test to become a security guard. He'd track down the thieves who stole his other coworker's ring. He'd wreck the Russian mob just to make sure that one girl had a future... And he'd be undeniably cool doing all this.This, however, is not the character that we see here. Here Robert McCall just watches how the Camorra wrecks the little town that he's grown to call home and, during most of the movie, does exactly nothing to stop that or help the people who suffer. The bad guys beat his friend to a bloody pulp. He does nothing. The bad guys burn his friend's store down. He does nothing. The bad guys hang a disabled man from the balcony of his apartment in front of everyone living in the building. He does nothing. The bad guys beat another friend of his - and this friend happens to be a policeman. He does nothing. The bad guys threaten to kill the policeman's child. He does nothing. They interrupt his dinner... Well, he finally does something. What follows is one of the nicely choreographed fight scenes that I mentioned in the first paragraph. Sadly, by the time it comes, most of the movie has already passed.And then there is the other huge problem - which is that in this particular movie you can easily replace Denzel Washington with Steven Seagal and absolutely nothing will change. Robert McCall in the previous movies had emotional range. Here he is a very well trained ex-military guy with experience in aikido who just looks down on everyone and always has the upper hand. There is even a scene that is like Seagal's signature - he uses his skills in aikido to bully and humiliate someone, his excuse being that his victim is actually a bad guy. Seagal's aikido is better, though.So... As you can probably tell, I am not happy with this movie. That's it.",NA
