"The Pope's Exorcist","tresm87","9 April 2023","Like clockwork we have at least 2 possession films each year around the same time. Easter and Halloween it seems. They're usually hit or miss with the same cliches strewn about with maybe some attempts at being slightly innovative. While this doesn't break away too much from the plot formula, Crowe's powerhouse performance does and amplifies the overall film to enticing levels. He has clearly found his late career niche with thrillers/horrors of late and it works extremely well. The scares are serviceable and the story is as well. Visually it's one of the best possession films I've seen in quite sometime with fantastic settings and terrific practical and cgi features. This doesn't mean the cliches don't hinder it at times but overall a very welcome film for the genre.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Sleepin_Dragon","25 April 2023","Father Gabriele Amorth is dispatched by The Vatican to assist a family, who's youngest member has become possessed by a powerful Demon, Amorth unearths all manner of secrets, some of which The Vatican would prefer stayed secret.I'll be honest, I had low expectations for this film, let's be honest, how many possession films have been released in recent years, some low budget some high, one or two pretty good, the majority not white. The Pope's Exorcist actually rates quite highly.There are the moments and sequences that you'd expect, the jump scares, the dialogues, the explosions, they're all there, but there is so much more, the characters are all well developed and have more depth than you'd expect, it delivers scares and emotional kicks in equal measure.Father Amorth is the coolest Priest I've seen on the big screen, Russell Crowe was brilliant, he was tough, he was funny, he drove a Vespa, on my book, be rocked.This film gave me back some faith in a genre that I thought had long since run its course.8/10.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","LovesCinematography","20 August 2023","It's a double edged sword when an actor becomes super famous. On one side, they are extremely marketable and gain great roles. However, on the other side, we tend to see the actor in the movie and not the character which distracts from the experience of the story.This was not the case with this film. I'm not an accent specialist nor a native Italian speaker, but Russell's portrayable had me convinced.The story itself was exciting and intriguing. There were some nonsensical aspects of course. Its a very fictional film with its own share of contradictions that are noticeable. The authenticity of the Vatican traditions and language barriers might have been compromised, but as a normal viewer, none of it was recognizable thus not bothered.Overall I give this a 7. It's not going to leave a lasting impression on me, but It was a good to watch.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","hillman_mcfc","8 April 2023","I honestly went in their with really low expectations. I walked out of The Devil in Me as we've seen it all before it's the same formula and nothing ever will live up to the original Exorcist. I think I can name 3 good exorcism movies. The Exorcist, Exorcist 3 and the Exorcism of Emily Rose. The plot really gets moving fast! There's no real character building but what I will say is Russell Crowe really does play the part well. It's a mixture of a great performance and a parody..whatever it is it works! It doesn't really do anything new, we've seen it all before but for some reason or another this was better than expected. Give it a watch.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","skyhawk747","9 April 2023","Having not seen a decent horror surface for a long time, I was quite excited to go along and see Crowe's first horror flick.It says ""inspired by Vatican files"" so I'm not quite sure how much of this film is factual but It's your typical possession story. However, Russell Crowe plays a solid and strong performance which makes his character very likeable and most importantly believable. I also liked his characters sense of humour which Crowe played very well..Lot's of cliches, although it was a good watch but not very scary. The special effects and CGI for the most of the movie were very good but it did struggle during certain moments. The depth to the plot was good but I feel the other characters could have been stronger.Overall, this is a good movie and Crowe carried it very well. I'd recommend that you go if you like this genre.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","nathangoffnett","16 May 2023","I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed The Pope's Exorcist. After initially seeing the trailers, I wrote this movie off as a standard possession film that I have seen time and time again, and while most of that is still true, there is something about this film that made it a joy to watch.The film does not attempt to do anything particularly new or groundbreaking in the genre, but everything it has is handled with care and precision. The direction is fantastic, with a very quick pace that makes each scene have a sense of urgency as our characters attempt to perform the exorcism. There is particularly deep lore that is established within the church structure, with different factions and politics at play that add a slightly different dimension rather than just your run-of-the-mill ""insert random priest here.""My favorite aspect of the film is the acting. I think all of the adult characters do a tremendous job here. Russell Crowe kills it in every scene he is in and definitely gives an entirely different take on the exorcist character. Where most are intensely serious and melodramatic, Crowe adds a bit of whimsicalness and youth to the character that creates a calming presence to every intense scene. His rapport with Daniel Zovatto is excellent. The two really play off each other well and carried the film in many ways. Alex Essoe was great, although underutilized. The two children were okay. The boy gave a very stereotypical portrayal of a possessed child, and the daughter was flat in many ways.My only complaint about the entire film is its lack of originality and the story. Every single beat is something that we have seen before; there were no new or fresh ideas that were interjected into the story. The tension was fine, but nothing was particularly scary. Overall, if not for the film's fantastic director and cast, it would have been a bomb.Score: 63% üëç
Verdict: Decent.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Eric266","21 August 2023","Russell Crowe plays the real life Pope's exorcist, Gabriele Amorth. Father Amorth passed away in 2006 and its probably a good thing. While this movie is spooky and entertaining, its a big, exaggerated, and I assume highly fictionalized, version of a time in Father Amorth's life.The Pope (Franco Nero) assigns Father Amorth to look into a potential demonic possession of a young boy in Spain. The boy, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney), his mother Julia (Alex Essoe) and his sister Amy (Laurel Marsden) are Americans who move to Spain after the death of Henry's father in a car accident. They are living in an old Spanish abbey that is the only think Julia's husband left them when he died in a car accident the year before. A local priest, Father Esquible (Daniel Zovatto) is out of his element, but is enlisted by Amorth to assist in the exorcism.The possession tropes are all here. Contortions, scary voices, lights going on and off, crosses turning upside down, people getting thrown around, possessed people spewing fluids and cursing, climbing walls and crawling around like spiders. There is a mystery about the origin of the abbey dealing with the church's role in the Inquisition.There is some gratuitous nudity that just felt out of place in this movie. I mean, I like naked breasts as much as the next guy, but it just felt a bit uneccessary.Crowe does a really good job as Father Amorth. He has the right balance of faith, weariness and conviction for someone who faces evil of all kinds. Zovatto's performance as Father Esquibel, to me, was the highlight of the film. He keeps everything grounded, despite the bizarre happenings. All three of the actors playing the family members are cookie-cutter performances and don't really add or subtract from the proceedings. There are some genuine chills in this move and a few scary moments. I enjoyed it and its crisp runtime kept it from getting boring. Still, I was hoping for a bit more story and less stunt work. I mean how many times do we need to see someone get thrown across a room into a mirrored wall and get right back up? One character, while wrestling with a possessed child, gets their head smashed through a ceramic sink with no effect. I might have tapped out and sought some aspirin.Enjoy it for what it is. Then go watch the Exorcist again.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","honeybloggs-69648","21 May 2023","Critics said that Russell Crowe's performance as an Italian was dismal . I strongly disagree . He captured the essence of an Italian man . His accent was excellent
I liked the way he delivered his lines and the way he showed his sense of humour . He was fantastic !The other actors were great too ! . The Set was brilliantThis film could have been spectacular .However it was marred by the boy. The little boy over acted his role . It looked ridiculous and laughable . It is not the child's fault . It was the casting director's fault and the film directors fault . The little boy had the 'stage school presence' about him . These kids who go to stage schools over emphasise everything as they are taught to . They are trained for roles in the Theatre where everything is over dramatised . So when these kids appear in films , it doesn't work . UNLESS the film director can obliterate that stage school training and give these kids a fresh approach and train them in a totally different way so they can act well in films .Also the voice the boy had as a demon was not synched properly ! It looked pathetic! . He looked like he was playing a joke on the Priests and would burst into a fit of giggles at any time . How could anyone involved in the film think that sounded scary and authentic! It made the film into a comedy horror ! I was laughing .If the Casting Director had chosen the right boy to play the part the film would have been fantastic . It is still a good movie and worth watching
The twist at the End is great and unexpected . Loved that! .Some people in this review section said it's been done before . Well it's very hard to get new concept in horror films. I don't care if it was done before as long as it's done well !","

"The Pope's Exorcist","RachelMary2","14 April 2023","Oh dear. I'm not sure if the makers of this movie were going for comedy horror or something else but it didn't really work. It was basically a film of silly voices. There wasn't enough tension to hold my engagement or enough story to keep me interested.Some of the effects were good but nothing I haven't seen before. Russell Crowe was enjoyable to watch but it was difficult to take his character seriously and I'm not sure as a viewer I was supposed to. It was all just a bit too silly for my taste. I didn't believe the setting, it was too fantastical and the family characters were more like caricatures. It sort of hinted at a story for them but that didn't really go anywhere. So, superfluous and silly but not awful.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","jp_91","6 April 2023","After seeing the trailer for ""The Pope's Exorcist"", I thought it would be another one of those lousy exorcism movies that have been released in recent years, but to my surprise I found a good, entertaining movie that enjoys some clich√©s of the exorcism movie theme. The performances are good, Russell Crowe achieves an interesting performance, while Franco Nero offers a successful performance. The script with the already boring legend: ""based on true events"", is entertaining and has innovative moments, other interesting ones and a funny appearance of clich√©s, the dialogues are usually plausible but some jokingly are absurd. The soundtrack has potential and the cinematography triumphs with its chiaroscuro, achieving a good atmosphere together with the filming locations. The downside are the digital special effects that look fake in several scenes, but the gore and some old-school effects are welcome. ""The Pope's Exorcist"" isn't the best exorcism movie ever made, but it manages to stand out from most that have touched on this subject in recent years.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","arungeorge13","6 May 2023","Julius Avery's films Overlord and Samaritan have offered differing outputs and satisfaction levels, but one thing that made them both stand out is their unique visual signature. So, when he ventures into an exorcism film set in Spain with Russell Crowe starrring, there's always a sense of ""oh let's see how that turns out."" That's just natural excitement! But the plot, the house-with-dark-secrets setting, the Vatican connection, the generic exorcism scenes - everything comes with a seen-that-before stamp. There's also some excessive CGI which is off-putting in horror films, further dissolving the overall impact.I'll give credit to Avery for some of the wider, panoramic shots. However, most of the interior scenes not only lack the basic horror ingredient (i.e. The element of surprise) but also the decision to juxtapose humour in critical situations takes the whole damn wind out of the sails. It works only when the humour is situationally dark and organic (like in, say Evil Dead Rise) but here, everyone except for Crowe's character is shown to be pissing their pants. And that includes the Pope himself. Also, the supporting cast is pretty hit-and-miss. Ultimately, this film does nothing for the exorcism sub-genre. It ends up being just another exorcism flick with very little redeemable qualities.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","FeastMode","7 May 2023","From my review for Prey for the Devil (2 stars): ""I also think I might be done with exorcism horror flicks. A couple come out each year and they're usually useless.""Because of this, I originally had no interest in The Pope's Exorcist. But I saw some good buzz around it and gave in. I thought it might be different. Why would I think that?How many times can we see a cross turn upside down? How many times can we see a body contortionist? How many times can we see a priest yelling at the possessed? How many times can we see someone thrown against a wall?It's all the same, and I don't know how people continue to be scared or entertained by it. This movie could not get me even 1% invested, intrigued or scared. I didn't care about anything except maybe how often the lead actress makes the same facial expression. (1 viewing, 5/6/2023)","

The CG was good along worth an effective score and good prosthetics.

"The Pope's Exorcist","SnoopyStyle","14 May 2023","It's 1987. Father Gabriel Amorth (Russell Crowe) is the Chief Exorcist appointed by the Pope (Franco Nero). He faces skeptism from some in the church. He refers 98% of his cases to the medical professionals. He is called to Spain for a dangerous case. Widower Julia (Alex Essoe) and her two kids, Henry and Amy, moved into an old Abbey inherited from her late husband. Henry becomes possessed. Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto) is the local priest.This suffers from the standard horror problem. The family would never stay in the house especially after the gas problem. Sure, the fireballs are fun, but no reasonable family would stay in a place that could blow up at any time. Amorth gives the mom a reason to stay, but the hot teen has to stay for completely different non-story reasons. Aside from that, this is a fine possession horror. It's not great. Russell Crowe gives this movie some heft. I would definitely play up the 'based on real story' aspect even if it's not true. The movie seems to end with sequels in mind. I don't see any of that coming.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","xxmisssvxx","20 April 2023","As someone that loves movies in general and often reviews films as they are, I saw this film last week and it was surprisingly better than expected. Is it golden globe worthy? Not at all but it is worthy enough to deliver what it was supposed to do? Yes. I love exorcism based films for the stories they tell and the types of demons we learn about through the stories. Exorcism films generally focus more on a storyline rather than the adrenaline of scare that differs (and separates) from the elements of creepiness. The Pope's Exorcist does just that - focuses on the story without much of the scare factor, which is exactly what this film should be, and is. That's what I wanted and got - a story. The only creepy elements are the castle, the grounds of the home itself. That's it. The cinematography was beautiful and the demon/possessions revealed in this film was solid; the aggressiveness of the demon. Russell Crowe delivers a strong performance with a pinch of sarcasm that compliments his character..
.The only element I didn't care for was the family, specifically the actors that were cast for their characters didn't fit the film in my opinion. Especially the actor cast as the daughter-who looked and felt disconnected. She was not the best choice for this role in my opinion; she just didn't fit in. This film is worth seeing but it won't be your first choice..

"The Pope's Exorcist","Howling_at_the_Moon_Reviews","23 August 2023","So I will say that this was better than I expected it to be. While the story wasn't anything crazy original or innovative, it was still thoroughly entertaining with solid and engaging pacing and decent acting across the board.Despite some wavering with the accent, and some cliche humor, I thought Crowe did a good job and I enjoyed his character. The mother also did a solid job, I am a fan of Alex Essoe. The only acting that stuck out negatively to me was that of Cardinal Sullivan.While I think this story would have been a bit more successful with something different than every other exorcism tale... it was very atmospheric, awesome locations and some really cool CGI/special effects. I don't think this will blow you away by any means but it is most certainly an entertaining, spooky experience.Despite its biggest downfall being lack of originality and recycling of clich√©s and tropes, I think a lot of other positives took up for that. 6.5 rounding to a 7, would recommend.","

But, being a horror fan I went into see this anyway.Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth, Chief Exorcist of the Vatican. The film follows Amorth in the summer of 1987 as he investigates a young boy's terrifying possession & ends up uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden.I found the film to be surprisingly good! At first, it seemed to be pretty sub standard stuff for a supernatural flick, though not bad. But, when it got to the middle & really broke in, it started to really show some good stuff going on & by the third act & the end, it was ace!The films runtime isn't bad at 97 minutes (1 hour & 37 minute), along with it's pacing which is a little slow in areas, but not bad. The characters of the family could've been better developed more I think, but the story is good & the visuals are pretty ace too along with a great triumph of an ending!Overall, it's a great film supernatural horror film! It isn't groundbreaking stuff, but what does it matter? It's got a good (true) story, has some great & scary visuals & a triumph of an ending you'll love! Russell Crowe is good in this & with a great runtime, & not bad pacing, this is one supernatural flick you won't want to miss!9/10.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","scootm16","14 April 2023","Wow what a boring, bland piece of demonic trash! Almost nothing happens this entire movie that takes place in basically one setting. Every trope ever conceived in an exorcism movie is on full display, but in the most bland way possible. It's as if the director doesn't know how to orchestrate tension because there was ZERO.The demon was an absolute joke with little to no power. All the demon would do was stay tied to the bed and yell terribly wirtten expletives that you would hear a 9 year-old yell in an Xbox Live lobby.The only somewhat redeeming/entertaining factor of this movie was Russell Crowe in an extremely random role. Still, they didn't let Crowe chew the scenery enough because the director probably wanted to keep the vibe of the movie ""dark and horrifying"", though it was most definitely neither.There was also a terrible part during the finale where Crowe and his sidekick pull out their crosses for one last chance at beating the demon. I kid you not, when they pulled out the crosses, they made a high-pitched ""power-up"" noise, as if the crosses were charging up a power attack. What an absolute joke!I can't believe all the people giving this dumpster fire a 9 or 10.

"The Pope's Exorcist","classicsoncall","18 July 2023","I haven't seen a lot of other movies of this type since 1973's ""The Exorcist"", so I can't relate to other reviewers remarking how this one resembles 'hundreds' of other films about exorcism. If there were hundreds of other exorcist movies, I think I'd at least be aware of them. For what this was, I thought it was pretty good. Russell Crowe portrays a dedicated but sometimes ribald servant of God, placed in the unenviable position of being a handpicked exorcist for the Pope. The Pope is never mentioned by name, but the years 1986 through 2016 coincide with the papacies of John Paul II, Benedict XVI and current Pope Francis. The one in the story, portrayed by Franco Nero, most closely resembles John Paul II, who reigned from 1978 till 2005.Though the movie follows a fairly traditional formula (like those hundreds of others), I thought it was well done. The opening scene prepares the viewer for the idea that most cases of presumed demonic possession are really something else requiring a doctor or psychiatrist to sort out. I wouldn't have expected the ratio to be 98:2, but on reflection, that seems to make sense. So, when Father Gabriel Amorth (Crowe) is dispatched to Spain to investigate the case of a young boy named Henry (Peter de Souza-Feighoney), he's immediately confronted by a demon that even he realizes will require immense effort to free the youth. Assisting Amorth is the local priest, Father Tomas Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto), who harbors a few secrets of his own that he must confess before the sacred rituals begin.A subtext of the picture involves the origins of the Spanish Inquisition and its origins, a topic I'm not familiar enough with to comment on, but something I'll want to investigate further. I'll also want to investigate the story of the real Father Gabriel Amorth, beginning with the William Friedkin directed documentary, ""The Devil and Father Amorth"", and maybe even pick up one of the books by the good Father. By all accounts, including the movie, they're supposed to be real good.","

The plot is slow and boring, nothing is unexpected or exciting. The cast don't give any kind of charisma or gel well. The use of Ralph Ineson's voice for the demon was very distracting and, because its so recognisable, had a negative effect on the believability while watching. The lack of originality was frustrating and I found it very difficult to engage in what was happening or even care.On the positive side, Peter DeSouza-Feighoney is quite an incredible actor. He stole the show and, for me, was the only good thing to come out of it.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","flicklover","20 April 2023","When u saw the trailer for this film I was like here we go again. Another demon possession film that will use the tropes that every film of this kind have used since The Exorcist. I understand that they are tropes that are necessary fur this type of film. There have been some, very few films about demonic possession that have been good. It is a tired sub genre that is just run out of good ideas.The Pope's Exorcist supposedly has two things going for it. It has Russell Crowe as Father Gabriele Amorth. This priest was a real exorcist at The Vatican so the trailer says the film is based on a true story. I had heard of Father Amourth and it would have been interesting to see a film that was about this man's pretty unique life. What we get is a very hammy performance by Crowe. But a bad performance but he seemed to be playing this with a wink. The story is about a widowed mother and her two kids that move into an abbey in Spain that was left to them by her husband. The son gets possessed by a demon so the Pope asks Father Amourth to go and investigate and perform an exorcism if needed. No more plot explanation needed. The family is just there to be victimized by the demon. We do not really get any time to care about this family so what happens to the boy is just plays as a checklist of every visual trope that has ever been put in one these films. There is no atmosphere, no tension, no sense of dread. Just a been there done that series of scenes that we've seen hundreds of times. Another arrives and of course starts the exorcism and we get a CGI filled, uninspired mid budget special effects battle. The film is not bad as much as it is lazy. Russel Crowe does his best to bring some value to the film but he can't save it.An uninspired, lazy, completely forgettable film.Grade: D.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","JPEI64","17 April 2023","A load of tripe disguised as a 'horror' movie, by using the Catholic Church (a favourite punching bag), the Pope and the Catholic faith as a crutch. It is to the Vatican's credit that no one objected to this drivel.Dreadful storyline, acting, script and dialogues. The kid looks anything but evil. Everything is hyper bloated to include explosions, bloody mouths spewing obscenities, twisting bodies and ear shattering screams - none of which are horrifying, - rather tiresome.So it's a been there done that movie that drains you halfway and just when you thought everyone's done, the voice says 'We' re not done yet!'. Aaaagh! The horrors!!Watch it if your cinemas has great popcorn and snacks. Otherwise, strictly avoid and offer a prayer for everyone connected with this nonsense.","

I mean his name value isn't as big as it was but he was awful, his accent, delivery and well just about everything was bad here, I'd have been so embarrassed. Surely their are Italian actors or ones who could've leant credibility to the role?The effects were tragic, the stuff with the women was hilarious but again looked ridiculous and the family weren't remotely interesting or likeable and some of the stuff the little boy said will no doubt be used as a joke for years to come.It was all so corny and ridiculous, there was nothing remotely scary, the story was rotten and the acting was even worse. Don't waste your money, I've seen plenty of exorcist movies from big obvious ones to budget dvd ones and this isn't even good enough to be a cheap dvd, avoid!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","ryandannar","9 September 2023","I don't think I'm going to leave a proper review of this movie, because it doesn't really deserve it. But you, dear reader, do deserve to know that this is probably the funniest exorcism movie I have ever seen.Was it supposed to be funny? I am not sure. It does seem like Russell Crowe is having a grand time playing the titular character. His role calls for broad gravitas delivered with a knowing wink, and Crowe handles the demands of the part like it's a piece a'cake, and looks like he's having a lot of fun doing it.But if the movie was intended to be camp, Russell Crowe seems to have been the only actor who got the memo. Everything about this movie is so overstated and ridiculous that it's impossible for it to be anything but funny.And yet, there is definitely something enjoyable about watching a bad horror film that makes you laugh at its awfulness. Despite blood, and bodily contortions, and blasphemous curses, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" never succeeds at being even a little bit scary. Nor does it succeed in having anything interesting to say, theologically, other than the notion that church atrocities may have been ""the work of the devil!""(I mean, come on, what isn't ""the work of the devil?"" I live in the overwhelmingly Christian state of Oklahoma, and I can assure you that if anyone ever did anything bad - or ever took pleasure in anything that made someone else feel icky - it was ""the work of the devil."" To me, calling something ""the work of the devil"" is akin to letting someone off the hook for their actions, disavowing personal responsibility, and/or shaming those who are different than you.)I digress. Anyway, the best exorcism films out there are still the original ""The Exorcist,"" and perhaps ""The Exorcist III."" Those films are scary not only because of horrific imagery, but also because they have a genuine interest in honest theological questions.In comparison, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" is about as scary as an episode of ""Scooby Doo."" But I did laugh almost continuously during this movie because it was so hilariously bad. And that's not worth nothing. Hence, four stars out of 10.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","CinemaSerf","13 April 2023","Based on a real character from the murkier side of quite recent Vatican operations, Russell Crowe dons his cassock and travels to a remote abbey in Spain where his meets with ""Fr. Esquibel"" (Daniel Zovatto). Why? Well it seems that a young boy is being possessed by a singularly nasty demon. Now Fr. Amorth is not unused to these scenarios and is also aware that the vast majority of these situations have nothing to do with satanic practices and more to do with mental health issues. Quickly, though, he realises that this is a serious and potentially deadly demonisation and both he and his colleague must discover what went on at this place and just who their violent foe is, before they can have any hope of casting it back into the shadows. That's the plot, and to be fair Crowe actually plays his character with a bit of charisma, but the rest of this is the same old loudly scored, visual effects feast with plenty of routine dramatic scenes: screaming, eye-popping, ceiling climbing, bodies and holy water thrown about the place and this one even has a bit of the Spanish Inquisition thrown in for added authenticity. It's not that is terrible - it isn't; it is just all so very derivative. Just because the exorcist was real doesn't actually make this film any different from an whole spate of other similar films that have the same beginning, middle, and end... It will do fine on the television around Halloween, but the cinema adds little to the presentation. It's nice to see that Franco Nero is still making films, but otherwise this is adequate, but nothing more.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","kosmasp","18 April 2023","No pun intended - actually puns, considering the layers I used with my summary line there. Probably more than I thought of at first. And the movie also way more entertaining and fun (in more than one way), than I expected. I have to admit, I actually thought this movie would not be any good ... maybe decent at best. So maybe I am going over the top a bit with the rating - or I am just right about that (only slightly kidding with that).Russell Crowe really seems to have fun with the character. Well it is based on an actual person - and the story is based on something he wrote (which supposedly or allegedly is really good - the end credits remind us of that). While there can only be one Exorcist (no pun intended, as in movie that is), there can be other movies that depict and have nice stories and/or characters.I had to endure some people in the cinema that were not really understanding the concept of cinemas and others not wanting to hear their voices - the woman going ""now now now"" right before a scary scene or jump scare was about to happen - very annoying. But I was able to blend that out, plus the movie was loud enough in the appropriate scenes for that not to matter. So even with having to endure stuff like that, I had a good time.Now the movie is not without flaws - the ... attempt to clear a lot of evil the church has done is quite brazen for example ... but I take it as creative freedom. Also not the worst idea if you want to plead not guilty ... you'll understand once you watch the movie.Good acting, good effects and while not every character may get the depth they deserve the planting/seeding and sowing ... works quite well. Blink and you'll miss some of the good things the cinematography has laid out for you - without the director putting too much emphasis on it. Especially when it is not spoon fed to you. Sometimes you have to let things fly/free ... they will come back to you (and with that pun I bid farewell - may the power of .. whatever you believe help you)","

"The Pope's Exorcist","allmoviesfan","24 July 2023","Not the best Italian accent from Australia's own Russell Crowe, but an interesting if dark and violent film based on a true story of Father Gabriele Amorth, apparently a somewhat cantankerous Vatican priest, and his attempts to try and free a possessed boy in Spain.What follows is, to be frank, fairly grim (there is not much in the way of sunshine and warm feelings in this one), and tests Amorth's faith. Crowe is pretty good in the role, a hulking sort of man with a weathered face who seems fairly implacable, even in the face of pure evil. The exorcism uncovers some awkward truths for the Catholic church. The finale was very well done, everything building to a crescendo.Not a religious person by any stretch, but I nonetheless found this darkly entertaining. Other than the accent issues, I thought Russell Crowe did a good job.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","teocrito","9 April 2023","The Exorcist changed everything after was released in 1973. It set the framework of every single horror movie about possessions or demons. From the scenery, the way the possessed person acts and the parts of the Bible they quote.There are good examples that comes after it. Some with the same ideas but new story lines and terrifying demons.However, this is not it. This is just another silly copycat of what the Exorcist tryed to achieve. It is the same thing all over again, nothing we haven't seen dozens of times in many other failed productions.It started OK. It had the typical Exorcist vibes. Some funny moments too. But then it is just got everything wrong.First of all, the story is predictable as hell, you know who is going to be possessed, why and how it is going to develop since minute one.Secondly, the localization is a joke. Of course, this is and American movie, so they do not expect, nor care, that someone is going to be able to recognize where is set. Anyone that has been in Segovia can tell there is no way that place is in there. Castille, especially that area is dry and with lots of plains. The place looks like it is in the north or in any other country. The actor that portrays the Spanish priest is from Costa Rica, and doesn't look like someone born and raised in the central meseta. Specially in the eighties, when Spain wasn't as multicultural as it is today. The same thing happens with the workers, they haven't seen a Spanish construction worker in their lives.The plot twist is just nonsense. The idea that the origin of the Spanish inquisition is because some bishop was possessed by a demon is just ridiculous. It is the product of the Spanish black legend. You just have to take a history book to know that there were inquisitions formed all over Europe in medieval times way long before the Spanish one. Of course they were cruel, but it wasn't nothing new at those times, and protestants and every single branch of Christianism did the same when it came to heretics.Just as we saw in the Exorcist, this movie use the same old Bible extracts and in the same way. They don't even care how silly it looks repeating the same formula since 1973. At least in that movie were trying to be realistic and before they could carry the exorcism they needed the authorization of the bishop and there needed to be a doctor present. Here they are just trying to look cool, with some typical head turning 180¬∞, a demon voice shouting blasphemies and lots of guttural noises. That is not an exorcism, that is just repeating what seems to be worked in dozens of movies before... But failed.Anyway, I could carry on with many more inconsistencies but this movie doesn't deserve it.I would skip it and watch The Exorcist instead, when it comes to movies about possessions you don't need any other.","

So while I was watching the movie I kept forgetting that it belongs to the horror genre. I mean sure, the make up was very creepy and also the voices of the possessed people was brought very well but still I was more focused on the story and it's ending than I usually am.Additionally it's important to point out that the actors were introduced very well and followed a good storytelling.In conclusion, don't watch it as the typical bad horror movie with jumpscares to keep you entertained and rather look at it as a story that's being told.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","BA_Harrison","6 April 2023","I'm a bit unsure about whether The Pope's Exorcist is supposed to be a serious film or a parody: the cast play it absolutely straight with little evidence of star Russell Crowe having his tongue in cheek, but the whole thing is so cheesy at times that it's hard to see how it could possibly be taken as anything but a knowingly daft pastiche of the genre. If you decide to go see the film, I suggest you don't take it too seriously...Crowe plays Father Gabriel Amorth, chief exorcist of The Vatican, appointed by the pope to deal with cases of demonic possession. Amorth is sent to Spain to investigate the case of a young boy, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney, doing a hilarious imitation of Linda Blair), who is acting most peculiarly. When the priest arrives, it's time for director Julius Avery to lay on the clich√©s that have been serving horror film-makers (many of them Italian) well for the past fifty years: guttural voices, levitation, rotating heads, vomiting, writing appearing on the body in welts, etcetera, etcetera.The demon causing all the trouble turns out to be none other than Asmodeus, one of the Kings of Hell under Lucifer the emperor. So he's a bit powerful. But Amorth is no slouch when it comes to such matters and, with the help of Spanish priest Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto), he engages the hell spawn in a battle of good versus evil which involves an exploding naked chick covered in blood and an appearance by the virgin Mary. The film is not exactly groundbreaking stuff - Exorcist rip-offs aren't exactly hard to come by - and there are moments that had me laughing out loud (Crowe's mouth transforming into a gaping maw is hilariously bad), but I was never bored.I'm going to be generous and give The Pope's Exorcist 6/10 - not essential viewing, but do we honestly think that David Gordon Green's The Exorcist remake, due out later this year, will be any better?","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Xstal","6 May 2023","Father Gabriel Amorth likes to come forth, to expunge evil with his religious force, if he can get it in a pig, he can soon make a rejig, with a shotgun, and a little bit of mirth. He's been sent over to Spain to take the pain, of poor Henry who's become a touch insane, as he's possessed by unnamed devil, who insults with lots of revel, on a bed they tie him down to keep contained. But this demon is a tricky thing to prise, a real nasty type of thing to exorcise, he's been contained under an abbey, his past keepers look quite shabby, and his sleeves are full of tricks and some surprise. So a battle wages between good and bad, Crowe's accent irritates, might make you mad, nowt you haven't seen before, although it's not really a chore, but it's not all that good either, is all I'll add.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","mDanHam","16 August 2023","My headline sums it up, but IMDb has a minimum character requirement, so here we go (yawn):
Starts out well enough; the setup is OK, atmosphere effective, acting good, story is (initially) intelligent, script literate, and the Catholic stuff is accurate enough that it won't make your head spin 'round. It draws a lot from ""The Exorcist"" and pays homage to that groundbreaking film in several ways, both visually and thematically, and not in a bad way.The story goes beyond a simple possession, and involves a more elaborate plan by the demon that will affect the whole Church. This aspect comes across like an afterthought, though; something contrived to try and put a new and different spin on worn out subject matter.Although the movie is fictionalized, Father Amorth was a real priest. His real name is used, and it's set in the 1980's. So why a generic Pope, rather than John Paul II?! He's obviously not supposed to be JP II, because he sports a beard, which JP did not, and he otherwise reflects none of JP's personality traits. Seems to be a deliberate attempt to distance the movie pontiff from the real Pope. Kind of undermines the whole ""Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth"" claim, wouldn't you say?All of that can be forgiven, however -- after all, it's just a movie. Likewise, I could even forgive the tired, trite, predictable old tie-ins to the Church's alleged past abuses and (haha, quite literally in this case) skeletons in the closet. (Monty Python notwithstanding, EVERYBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition!)So, what goes wrong? Instead of something sensible that aligns with the rest of the movie's realistic tone, the climax wallows in overblown theatrics better suited to Marvel or DC. Is this supposed to be believable, or is it about gods and monsters? Give me a break.Dear Hollywood: Please stop making demonic possession movies. What's that...? Yet ANOTHER one due out later this year?!! Lord, save us.","

It is upto the chief exorcist of Vatican to save this family while uncovering the dark secret behind this demon and that mansion. Based on the experiences of a real life exorcist, The Pope's Exorcist tries to be this decade's new Conjuring but it doesn't have enough meat in it to be one.The story is pretty basic and so are the scares but what it lacks is properly establishing the characters. It begins so haphazardly, I for one couldn't care less for the family moving into the new mansion. Sure, there was a personal loss involved, rebellious teenager and a traumatized boy. Even a mother who can fight back a demon to get back her kids safely. But those initial scenes fail to create any concern for the family.It does however show promise with the mystery behind the demon as the priests try to figure out it's name and uncover a dirty Vatican secret. The film somehow revived itself in the second act but the all too generic third act, ensured The Pope's Exorcist was nothing more than an ordinary watch. Russell Crowe gave his best to carry the film forward but even he can do only so much with a screenplay that doesn't try to raise above the routine stuff.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","alfredvankuik","18 April 2023","It's the 80s and Russell Crowe is now an exorcist. He is quirky and excentric. He also ignored a mentally unwell woman who told him she was being sexually abused by a priest but that's okay because he's quirky and excentric so it's okay.Then there's a demon bullying a poor American family and only Russell Crowe can help, so he hops on his Vespa and drives all the way from the Vatican to Spain (I'm not kidding, the movie seriously implies this). He drinks some whiskey and starts talking to the demon. The demon is apparently the king of hell, but he is less active than the average housecat. Despite not being tied down, he mostly just lays on the bed spouting nonsense and puking up baby birds every now and then. The mother doesn't seem too concerned by her son puking up baby birds and soundly sleeps through most of the movie while both her kids are being possessed.The actual exorcism in this movie is slow and inconsistent. Russell Crowe has a Spanish sidekick, another priest with many sins under his belt and who doesn't know how to pray properly. He chokes a kid at one point but it's okay because the kid said something mean to him. They both just stand by Henry's bed and mumble some prayers while the demon shrugs them off and keeps giving everyone cliche horror visions of dead loves ones. There's not a lot of progression to it all besides the forced character arcs of the priests confessing their horrible sins and being washed clean of them way too easily.Then Russell Crowe uses his priest senses to find a hidden well full of skulls from Spanish inquisition victims. He finds this really funny, taking one to throw at people as a funny prank because he is quirky and eccentric. The movie goes out of it's way to say the church was not to blame for the Spanish inquisition because the ones giving the orders were possessed at the time, which of course makes total sense.But back to the exorcism. Russell Crowe finds the demon's name in the magical well of exorcisms past and he goes back up to Henry, who does a few cool party tricks, suddenly being way more active just so the movie can throw in the cliche backwards spider walk. Russell has to be the hero and sacrifices himself to the demon to save the random Americans. This is when his trusty sidekick suddenly becomes competent and runs after Russell Crowe into the magical well of exorcisms past to save him. A truly hilarious encounter ensues where they both hold up a cross and the demon just kind of goes ""oh noes"" and dies. The ending is Disney/Marvel style happy and positive with everything falling into place and even setting up a franchise possibility.The whole movie has an offputting vibe of glorifying the catholic church. The priest characters are terrible human beings, which in itself is fine, but they are portrayed like Marvel style superheroes by the end. On top of this, the random mix of languages gives it an even weirder vibe. Russell Crowe was only paid enough to learn a little bit of Italian so everyone else has to adjust to him because they couldn't just hire an Italian to play an Italian. Even the pope talks English to himself which makes zero sense.The Pope's Exorcist is a mess. It's hilarious at times, but it doesn't feel like it's trying to be. It is mediocre at best at being a horror film and it sucks at everything else. Russell Crowe is okay but the only acting that is truly noteworthy is Peter DeSouza-Feighoney as the possessed kid. He saves this film somewhat from being utter trash.If you're a catholic who wants to see a horror movie that confirms your worldviews, this is for you. If you're anything but that, avoid.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","johnhsmith-00056","13 September 2023","What a ride! Russell Crowe playing an Italian priest. Pretty good accent too.So we have a LOT of great story arcs crammed into this film. A story about a boy's father who died, and problems the boy has had since then. A major incident during the Spanish Inquisition that was covered up by the Church. Two priests with major guilt in their pasts. Father Amorth dealing with Vatican politics, and of course, a challenging and horrific exorcism. Each one of these storylines could have been a film in itself, so that's a lot of information to shoehorn into 103 minutes. And it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I would have rather seen these stories fleshed out a bit into a series.A lot of reviews are complaining that the film uses a lot of other exorcism tropes from various films. Well, it does, but to be fair, some of that is because this is a film about Gabriele Amorth, whose life inspired many of those other films. It's flawed, but overall highly recommended.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","stevendbeard","14 April 2023","I saw The Pope's Exorcist, starring Russell Crowe-Unhinged, The Mummy_2017; Daniel Zovatto-Lady Bird, Don't Breathe; Franco Nero-John Wick: Chapter 2, Die Hard 2 and introducing Peter DeSouza_Feighoney-his first movie.This movie is based on the case files of a real Catholic priest by the name of Gabriele Amorth-he died in 2016. He was like the top gun exorcist of the Vatican Church-who only answered to the Pope himself-and usually could tell pretty soon if a possession was real or something else, like a mental disorder or a fake. This story is about a young boy's possession. Russell plays Gabriele-who likes to travel by a Vespa motorcycle-Franco is the Pope and Peter is the boy with the unwanted inhabitant. Peter's family move to an inherited castle in Italy but unbeknownst to them, it's got buried secrets inside, one being a demon living in the basement that goes for Peter. When Daniel-the local priest-can not handle Peter's possession, Russell is called in to help but Russell soon learns of past situations that effect the present. One of them being a conspiracy that the Vatican has been hiding.It's rated R for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.It's not a bad horror movie-it was kind of interesting-and would be a good one to stream.","

Lets not forget also the gravelly voice of the 'Demon', because clearly ALL Demons have to speak like they've smoked 100 cigarettes a day for the last 40,000 years.There really was nothing new in all of this, perhaps with the exception of Crowe's renegade Priest riding a Vespa, that was new.We even had the obligatory thunder storms, dozens of lights everywhere, but the rooms remaining in relative darkness...

"The Pope's Exorcist","littlesatanhooves","5 May 2023","Let it be said once and for all that there will never be another movie on the rituals of Christian exorcism after The Exorcist (1973). After you have seen the original, you have seen them all, no matter how hard they try to make one different from another. I must say that I had a lot of expectations riding on 'The Pope's Exorcist', but after a few minutes into the movie, I lost all hope for something new, something different, something more exciting. It wasn't a bad movie actually. It's just that it tried to be more than another movie about demonic possession but like I said, you cannot stretch the premise any much further than what The Exorcist (1973) already achieved. Having said that, I wonder how the Blumhouse take on the forthcoming Exorcist, to feature Ellen Burstyn, will fare. I wait with bated breath,","

"The Pope's Exorcist","andresbrito-imdb","19 April 2023","In an official statement, the International Association of Exorcists states that the movie ""instills the belief that exorcism is an abnormal, monstrous, and terrifying phenomenon, whose only protagonist is the demon, whose violent reactions can be faced with great difficulty. This is exactly the opposite of what happens in the context of exorcism celebrated in the Catholic Church in obedience to its directives.""The IAE adds that ""The Pope's Exorcist is contrary to historical reality, distorts and falsifies what is truly lived and experienced during the exorcism of truly possessed individuals. Moreover, it is offensive regarding the state of suffering in which those who are victims of an extraordinary action of the demon find themselves. Exorcism is an extremely joyful event because, while there is a vivid experience of the presence and action of Christ the Lord.""It is not necessary to point out that, once again, Hollywood spreads historical nonsenses about the supposedly evil Spanish Inquisition. Who had read about the real father Amorth face the fact that this garbage knows absolutely nothing about he or his minister against evil.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","wellthatswhatithinkanyway","18 July 2023","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulAfter the death of her husband, Julia Vasquez (Alex Essoe) and her children, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) and Amy (Laurel Marsden) head off to Spain to renovate an old church, only for Henry to become seemingly possessed by a demonic entity. The Vatican enlists the help of Father Gabriel Amorth (Russell Crowe), an unconventional priest who is still reeling from attempting to perform a previous exorcism that went devastatingly wrong. Along with his assistant Father Tomas Esquibel (Daniel Zovato), he tries to have better luck with Henry, but obfuscation from the Vatican seeks to stand in his way.Helped in no small part by his Hell-raising off screen persona, Russell Crowe naturally lends himself to parts with an element of the reckless, play-by-his-own-rules maverick type, in this case a priest no less, in this supernaturally themed thriller from director Julius Avery, allegedly based on true events, and pointing a wider accusatory finger at the already much maligned internal practices of the Catholic Church. His performance seems to be the most hailed aspect of this production by everyone who's seen it, and it does carry the restrained intensity to it that he has made his own over time. And yes, it probably is the best thing to say about this otherwise unfortunate horror entry.Themes of religious damnation and Satanic possession have been key themes of the horror genre since back in its heyday, with films such as Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, and even the church restoration subplot feels like a nod to 1973's Don't Look Now, so Avery's film has something of a foundation to build itself on. Sadly, on execution, it plays out unremarkably like a standard modern day horror film, loaded with cheap jump scares and overwrought exposition, with nothing to make it get under the skin in any deeper, more meaningful way than any other such film, with only Crowe's inner conflicts to really distract in any true way.The Exorcist it ain't. **","

"The Pope's Exorcist","IonicBreezeMachine","3 May 2023","Set in 1987, following the death of her husband, Julia Vasquez (Alex Essoe) relocates to Castile, Spain with her teenage daughter Amy (Laurel Marsden) and young son Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney), who has been mute since the death of his father, to restore an Abbey that her husband owned to sell off to alleviate the loss of income. Eventually, Henry begins exhibiting odd fits and disturbing behavior that medical professionals aren't able to explain which leads to local priest Father Tomas Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto) relaying the situation to The Vatican where The Pope (Franco Nero) sends his chief exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth (Russell Crowe) to investigate where he stumbles upon a long buried conspiracy by the Vatican that could spell the Church's destruction.The Pope's Exorcist is loosely based on the real life of Father Gabriele Amorth (in that there was a real exorcist named Gabriele Amorth which is pretty much where the similarities end). The movie features most of the well known tropes and trappings that are part and parcel to this type of genre ""exorcise"", but despite how well worn these tropes are Russell Crowe does add an off beat sense of humor and charm to the all too familiar material.The biggest issue that faces The Pope's Exorcist is the fact that much like many other exorcism movies, it owes a great deal to the 1973 film The Exorcist which established all the various iconography and tropes that have been revisited time and time again in not only certain follow-ups to The Exorcist, but also the various derivatives of it. This is a very well-trodden formula and while director Julius Avery does try to add some flair and intensity to the material, it is basically the same beats we saw with the possession of Regan in The Exorcist complete with all the swearing, scarring, and vomiting you've come to expect. The movie does try to expand on the material by incorporating things about the Vatican's shame from the Spanish Inquistion or sexual abuse by the clergy, but it rather tastelessly tries to say that these were the work of demons trying to pervert the institutions of the church and it sort of feels like a cop-out for predatory behavior and seems really tone deaf to bring it up at all.In the middle of all of this is a pretty entertaining performance by Russell Crowe as Father Gabriele Amorth and the fact that he plays this character very jovially with a likable air around him does enliven much of the more leaden parts of the movie that feel ""been there done that"". Franco Nero also has a brief supporting bit as The Pope and while good to see him, he does feel a little squandered in this movie but there are probably plans to include him in a follow-up as the ending seems to be setting up a franchise.The Pope's Exorcism is basically just another exorcism movie that owes many of its tricks and tropes to the forebearers of the subgenre, most notably The Exorcist. Russell Crowe's central performance is quite likable and engaging, it's just a shame he's left to carry a very generic and not all that interesting story.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","paulclaassen","4 October 2023","By now there are probably just as many exorcism movies out there as there are zombie or vampire movies. It becomes difficult to distinguish between them, especially with most exorcism movies being so similar, and all of them following the same pattern. My favourites are still 'The Exorcist' and 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose'.Russell Crowe stars as real-life Father Gabriele Amorth, who supposedly performed thousands of exorcisms. This is but one of his stories. He is a bit unorthodox in his methods and his (much younger) superiors does not really believe in demons - or evil for that matter - anymore. They seek logical explanations for strange occurrences and events attributed to possession and demons.Recently widowed Julia inherited an abbey in the countryside of Spain. She moves there with her young son Henry - who hasn't spoken a word in over a year since his dad died - and her rebellious teenage daughter Amy. Julia hopes to restore the abbey in order to sell it.However, soon after moving in, Henry is possessed by a powerful demon. Hearing about this, the Pope sends Gabriele to see Henry. What happens next, is pretty much what happens in almost every exorcist movie - the exorcist tries to determine who the demon is, the demon refuses to leave, the exorcist tries to save the victim. Same old, same old. Yet, despite this familiar pattern, I do love watching exorcism movies. Why? I enjoy the contortion effects, the make-up, and the good versus evil premise.I thought Russell Crowe was rather good as Father Gabriele. The climax in 'The Pope's Exorcist' also dishes up and serve more than just a fair share of CGI, but it was all good. Although 'The Pope's Exorcist' is a good movie in its own right, in time I might forget what it is about with the myriad of possession movies out there, and this one not offering anything to elevate it above the rest.","

""What are the signs of possession?""
""He Converses in English, Father""The film turned out to be the complete opposite of what I initially assumed; the script deviated from the set expectations and ventured into territories that did not seem consequential. The tonality is all over the place here; not only did the story fail to convince me of the horror, but at times the writing made the situation comical.Was that unintentional or deliberate? Hard to come to a conclusion! Thus, the plot lacked coherence and failed to establish a clear direction. Additionally, the characters were underdeveloped and lacked depth, making it difficult to empathise with their conditions.My only query is why you felt the need to inject humour into a film that was intended to be conventional horror. The atmosphere is ruined, the plot's core is destroyed, and the consequences have an adverse impact on the outcome. The only thing I can state in favour of ""The Pope's Exorcist"" is that I admired Russell Crowe and whatever he did here, but other than that, I found it to be mostly intolerable.","

Until he comes across a demon that is putting him to the test. The plot is forgettable. About a mother and her two children moving to italy. Until the son gets possessed which Crowe comes in to help save the boy.Russell Crowe did great. The rest of the cast ensemble is a bit forgettable with bland performances. The direction does lack scares and thrills. Besides the demons voice coming from the boy seemed more cheesy than frightening. This is one film that misses its mark in being scary.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","The-Sarkologist","4 February 2024","I'm not sure why I actually wanted to see this film. Probably because it starred Russel Crowe, and that it was based on a true story. Mind you, I suspect that when they say that it is based on a true story, it is using the term in probably the loosest way imaginable. However, there are some things in relation to this film that do stand out, even if you could pretty much say that it is just another of the many remakes of The Exorcist (which I have to admit I haven't seen it, and I probably should make a decent effort to rectify that).Anyway, the movie is about a real person upon whose diaries, that were published, were an inspiration. Probably the only two truths about the film is that there was a chief exorcist for the Pope with that name, and that a lot of the things that he does comes down to determining whether it is a real demon or just mental illness. I suspect the main part of the film, particularly with the diabolical plan to take over the world, and that Russell Crowe is the only one who and stop it, is mostly fabricated.Look, I'm one of those people that do believe in a spiritual reality, and that there is a significant connection between metal illness and demon possession. Mind you, I wouldn't be encouraging people to use an exorcist to go around curing mental illness, in the same way that I wouldn't be writing off demon possession as simply mental illness. My issue though is that mental illness is a catch all thing that people seem to over diagnose, or use to attempt to extract sympathy for them.In the end though I can't really say whether this is a great film or not. I guess it is okay, but it isn't something that I'm really going to be raving about. Mind you, I personally cannot claim to be an expert in demon possession (and I would certainly be treating anybody who claims to be with an incredible amount of suspicion), but I suspect a bulk of the things in this film are Hollywood dramatisation. Personally, I certainly wouldn't be using this as a guide - especially considering a specific scene in Acts.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Pairic","12 April 2023","The Pope's Exorcist: ""That'a beautiful pig."" Only the best, Father."" Chief Vatican Exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth (Russell Crowe) uses porcine props as he casts out demons Gadarene Swine style in Italy in 1987. But 98% of ""possessions"" are due to mental illness he explains to a Vatican panel afterwards. He puts an arrogant young US Cardinal in his place, reminding him that only the Pope issues orders to Amorth. Indeed the Pope (JPII) sens Amorth to Spain where an American mother, teen daughter and young son are having troubles in an Old abbey the mother was having restored. This is a stock family, caring worried mother, sullen teen who doesn't want to be there but the boy, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) shines as he becomes the subject of a Demon's attention. Some great scenes of horror as the possessed child tosses priests through doors, chokes people and causes Poltergeist effects. Also alarming is the way the demon tempts and taunts those around him with memories of their past sins and failures. We even get the spider walk, But something far more sinister is going on, the Pope (Franco Nero) researches old documents regarding the Abbey's history whilst Amorth is his field commander in the fightagainst Satan. Crowe has an endearing, humerous style as he portrays Amorth, wisecracking, irreverent, fond of coffee and the odd nip of whiskey. DeSouza-Feighoney deftly goes through a demanding performance as the possessed boy with Ralph Ineson voicing the demon. My favourite scene was the Pope projectile vomiting blood on to the US Cardinal. A lot more fiction than fact here but it's a highly entertaining horror film even if it would have been better with a 90 minute running time rather than 103. Directed by Julius Avery, from a screenplay by Michael Petroni and Evan Spiliotopoulos based on Amorth's memoirs An Exorcist Tells His Story and An Exorcist: More Stories. 7.5/10.","

Money could have been saved by casting a lesser-known actor as the lead and it still wouldn't have made a great deal of difference to this film's overall appeal. It's definitely entertaining but because it's not as disturbing as The Exorcist or as intriguing as The Da Vinci Code, it offers nothing new in either genre and settles somewhere in the middle, as a well produced but slightly puzzling mix of horror and popcorn (with explosions). 'Let's go to work' Amorth says when the true extent of his mission is revealed just before the credits roll - presumably meaning there will be 199 sequels.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Vivekmaru45","3 May 2023","Indeed the New Zealand actor has come a long way from Romper Stomper. You should also see other exorcism movies like Possessed(2000) and The Haunting In Conneticut(2009). Then there are two versions of the prequel to The Exorcist(Dominion and Exorcist The beginning). The Legend Of Hell House(1973) is another good movie along with The Changeling(1980) and The Woman In Black(1989). It should be remembered that The Exorcist is a trilogy and William Peter Blatty directed the last one himself to show the true vision of his books.This movie is about a boy who is possessed by a demon who specifically targets priest Gabriele Amorth(played by Crowe) who is the chief exorcist of the Vatican. So the movie deals with the ritual of exorcism that is condemned by the Vatican and rarely given permission to perform it. I won't reveal more of the plot, watch the film and find out what happens...Verdict: I was impressed with the photography and sound-effects. The CGI effects are commonplace these days compared to big budget CGI movies. The acting by Crowe is decent. He reminds me a lot of the late actor Oliver Reed who ironically starred alongside him in Gladiator. Crowe has aged now, but not so badly. He can still offer a decent acting performance. The performance he gave in Unhinged(2020) disturbs me till this day.Check out the above movies along with Burnt Offerings 1976, Poltergeist 1982, Haunted 1995, Stir Of Echoes 1999, The Haunting 1999, What Lies Beneath 2000, Thir13en Ghosts 2001.

"The Pope's Exorcist","GusherPop","18 April 2023","The Pope's Exorcist is a film that combines the two images of a gunslinger and a priest. Russell Crowe plays Father Gabriele Amorth, a theologian, journalist, book author, and the pope's designated exorcist. Amorth is a sly, tough, wisecracking priest who approaches each mission like a gunslinger, carrying an exorcism kit with crucifixes and holy water in a case the size of a saddlebag. His horse is a red-and-white scooter that is too-small for Crowe's character-actor body, but makes a perfect sight gag for that reason. Amorth also has a tiny whiskey flask that he insists on carrying to ease his scratchy throat. The film is written and performed like one of those wry, hard-bitten bad-asses that used to be played in 1960s Westerns by aging but still-popular action stars like Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, and John Wayne. The most important details in this text are that Russell Crowe has been so good for so long that he glides through this role as if he has nothing to prove. He goesofs around and adds surprising little gestures and reactions to enliven a scene, but never goes so far that he seems to be making fun of the movie. When Amorth discloses his own spiritual torment in a series of flashbacks, Crowe plays it straight, suffering and writhing as if he's in an Ingmar Bergman movie. He seems to be at roughly the same career point as Paul Newman in the early 1970s when his hair went silver and he lost most of his vanity. Even when a scene is serious, he's having fun. Crowe plays Amorth as a prideful cut-up, greeting vile taunts with a deadpan smirk and snappy answers. He is even more appealing when he lets the audience see his insecurities that the priest keeps hidden. The Pope's Exorcism is a horror movie that explores the depths of an increasingly stale exorcism horror subgenre. Russell Crowe is hammier than an Easter dinner as Father Gabriele Amorth, spitting out Italianized dialogue that Chris Pratt could learn from for the inevitable Super Mario Bros. Sequel. The movie is a mood board movie that favors chunked-off ideas over a cohesive whole, making it a mood board movie that favors chunked-off ideas over a cohesive whole. Those who want something profound will be doomed, while those who love to laugh through questionable pulp that aims to entertain might find more enlightenment than they expect. When Father Esquibel tells Amorth that he's read his articles about possession in magazines, Amorth mentions that he writes books, too. When Avery cuts to traveling shots of Amorth on his scooter, the frock, collar, fedora, and sunglasses make the character iconic: coolly ridiculous and ridiculously cool. The Pope's Exorcist is a possession movie that tries to be everything from The Exorcist to Men in Black, with barely mixed results. Russell Crowe plays Rome's Chief Exorcist with an Italian accent cracked from a can of Chef Boyardee. Director Julius Avery indulges the freakier elements of demonic overtakings with a B-movie sensibility, much like how he turned the massively enjoyable Overlord into a freakish WWII monster mash. This approach hits almost as much as it misses, but at least when scenes work, The Pope's Exorcist is an unintentional horror-comedy that doesn't try to be anything other than an aggression-forward religious nightmare that taunts saints and torments sinners.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","akshatmahajan","14 July 2023","While watching John Wick 4 in theatres, I saw the trailer for this movie but the trailer failed to impress me so I decided for digital print to come out.The movie felt more like a drama movie than a horror movie but the drama was good. It was not just jump scares or other scary cliche but it dramatized the whole situation in a decent way. The horror element was missing so the studio should have marketed this movie as a drama movie with horror as sub-genre. The performances were good, could have been better. The direction and screenplay was fine. There are talks of sequel but I don't know what's will be there new to show.Overall, you can give it a try at least for entertainment purpose.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","cristinasamsar","29 October 2023","Was entertaining, and is well made but there are errors that are a little bad, for example saying that the story happens in a part of Spain while anything that appears is Spain: not the mountains, not the sea, not the weather, not anything.Then, I don't know, this is just personal opinion, but saying that all the bad acts of the christianity was the Satan's fault... I mean, what a simple excuse, blaming other. But well, this is just the story so, like I said, it's just my personal opinion.Another example is that if the lower part of the house is flammable, why when is everything on fire it just don't explote?But well, like I said, have mistakes but there are other parts that are okay, like the actors.

"The Pope's Exorcist","tkdlifemagazine","19 August 2023","Old School Horror and possession film. This is a well done homage to the films of the 1970's of similar theme, but the advent of modern filmmaking techniques makes them more visually engaging. You MUST suspend sense and belief to enjoy this but if you do you will find a good time. The best part is Russel Crowe's dynamic performance as the Pope's Exorcist, an Italian Priest with a belief in Demons, a love of coffee, and a good sense of humor. When people take themselves very seriously in a film it can go either way- either they become stupid, or they convince the audience they really believe. In this one they do the latter so it works. A fun time. No judgement on what your religious beliefs are.","

Editing and sound was choppy and not well done, the story and visuals darting from scene to another. Russel must have owed a big debt to Satan this star in this atrocity, his character was likeable but as he vocalised his dismay in not seeing the abuse a girl suffered by the hands of the Vatican or that *gasp* the Spanish Inquisition was actually the devils fault due to a the main man being possessed. The movie turned into a Catholic self serving, guilt ridden confession can of worms. This movie had soooo much potential but it fell short in so many ways, production, story, script and scares. There wasn't any scares. A bit of fun but that's about it.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","maddison-59657","3 May 2023","Anytime I see a movie with Russell Crowe starring in it, I always will watch it as he is such a brilliant Actor. This movie seemed interesting to me as it was supposedly based on a real person, so I decided to watch it. What a massive disappointment. As usual Russell Crowe's performance was really good, however it doesn't make up for a really rubbish movie. The rest of the cast, if that is what you can call them, were just dreadful and can'y act. It is like the Casting Agent went down to the local Supermarket and just picked out people from random to be in this movie. Their performances are wooden and not believable at all. As for the movie, the way that the Director headed with this was just a joke. Obviously he had stolen scenes from the 1973 movie ""The Exorcist"" starring Lina Blair (which is probably the scariest movie that I have ever seen!), and failed miserably due to the poor acting ability of the rest of the cast. It was more of a comedy than a Horror. If you would like my honest opinion then don't bother with this movie and watch the 1973 ""The Exorcist"" movie if you are looking for a real scare.If you do decide to watch it, then please leave Feedback.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","pkhall1","19 August 2023","Crowe's acting was excellent. I thought he really did a great job. The problem was, however, that the story was just frankly ridiculous, and no matter how good someone is of an actor when you put them in a vehicle such as this, it's just an accident waiting to happen. I thought that the priest, who accompanied Father Gabriele was just an OK actor until the last scene he was in. I think the biggest problem with the movie was the fact that the young boy simply could not act. Every single scene that he was in I just felt he ruined if you're going to have a movie with subject matter such as this you really need to make sure that that character that the whole thing is centered around is really awesome in the role. Unfortunately, it was a tragic performance.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","adrianhextall","11 April 2023","Inspired by rather than a retelling of a particular story does of course give the script writers and film makers far more freedom to do what they want rather than being trapped by the constraints of a story like the Amityville Horror.The story starts along the same lines as The Conjuring, the remote location, the family newly moving into the property to start afresh but this moves the location from outback USA to outback Spain.It's a neat move as it allows the scripts to focus on elements such as the Spanish Inquisition, the Catholic Church and more and keep the story grounded in some semblance of history and mythology surrounding religion.Russell Crowe does a great job as a wise, weary Priest (the Pope's own appointed Exorcist) and alongside the local Spanish Priest who unsurprisingly has no idea how to deal with a possession within his own community, the pair work together well. Their scenes are reminiscent of the pairing from the Exorcist (1973) with the older, knowledgeable one guiding the younger, more reticent one who believes but doesn't quite fully believe what is going on.The pacing of the story works well, the young actor playing the possessed boy deserves multiple supporting actor awards as he really carries the underlying feel of tension and threat.It all builds up to a satisfying climatic conclusion and comes recommended for anyone wanting a little more of the same with a modern take on how to present it all.","

He is still quite young enough to get himself back into shape, which may be why he was offered this part, where his weight is hidden by a black robe, please, Russ, get back to some semblance of fitness. His skin colour is quite healthy now, so it looks like he may have conquered cigarettes, which gave him the smokers grey skin for many years.

It's the same possession type movie you've seen before with a different title and actors. The same cliches and possession symptoms. All the actors performances were okay although I could not take the possessed boy seriously in any of his scenes. The demonic voice they gave him was just very comical and it didn't suit him well at all. He was not frightening or intimidating. He just looked like a sick kid.The scenes where the character ""Rosaria"" was used as an illusion could have been improved, they felt cheap. This movie didn't provide any terror or thrills.

"The Pope's Exorcist","nogodnomasters","26 April 2023","The film is inspired by the life of Father Gabriel Amorth, who was a famous exorcist. Russell Crowe played a convincing Italian priest, mostly because he doesn't have to sing. I still hold a Les Mis√©rables grudge. We see him performing an exorcism on a boy he does not believe is really possessed in June of 1987. In a subplot in July, Julie (Alex Essoe) from America is fixing up an old estate she inherited from her husband. She is there with her teen daughter Amy (Laurel Marsden) who would rather be anywhere but here and her son Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) who has not talked since watching his father impaled in a traffic accident. An incident causes Henry to have convulsions. The local priest (Daniel Zovatto) who has his own issues, believes Henry needs an exorcist after getting tossed out of the room. We later discover the demon's name is none other than Asmodeus and he wants the soul of the Father Amorth.If you saw the original Exorcist film, you pretty much know how the ritual goes and the profanity that is used. Even though things were ""predictable"" as far as the exorcist genre, I loved the ending basement scene with the use of flaming symbols.Guide F-word. No sex. Nudity (Bianca Bardoe, Carrie Munro)","

"The Pope's Exorcist","m-abtahi","28 January 2024","I recently watched the 2023 horror film ""The Pope's Exorcist,"" and it falls into the horror genre, sparking comparisons with other films in the same category, according to critics.What caught my attention was the film's unique focus on the seriousness of exorcism within the context of religious traditions. Unlike some, it neither denies nor dismisses the traditional aspects of exorcism but rather portrays traditionalists realizing the need to renounce the era of dogmatic scrutiny and excessive rigidity that has tarnished the Church's reputation.The plot takes a turn as the exorcist priest discovers a place, presumed to be the devil's lair, where documents from the era of the Church's extremism are found. The artistic solution presented in the film suggests a cinematic and creative approach to absolving the Church from its past extremism, symbolically placing it on the shoulders of Satan.Ultimately, the film serves as a historical reminder that there must always be those willing to shoulder the responsibility for mistakes. Interestingly, even the priests opposing exorcism refuse to undertake this responsibility, revealing the complex dynamics within the film's world.This cinematic creation, directed by Julius Evory and starring Russell Crowe as the exorcist priest Gabriel Amorth, offers a unique perspective on the clash between tradition and reform within the Christian faith.","

While based on a real character the story is completely made up but at least entertaining. If you like horror type movies this may be ideal for you. Any while it is not a great movie, it is heads and shoulders above much of the awful PC garbage that Hollywood produces these days. Russell Crowe is quite good as Father Gabriel Amorth as is Franco Nero who plays the Pope in this movie. While I can live without some of the silliness like a possessed person crawling around like a spider, the movie is still entertaining, which is the reason we watch movies in the first place.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","masonsaul","11 July 2023","It's not even remotely scary and operates exclusively on tropes that have been done better elsewhere but The Pope's Exorcist remains dumb fun mainly thanks to the fact that it operates like a buddy cop film almost as much as it is a generic possession film resulting in a lot of hilarious moments, intentional or otherwise.Russel Crowe is the main reason any of this works. Everything about his performance, including his reliably dodgy accent, is so entertaining and if this role was in the hands of an actor doing an actually good performance the film would be so boring. His jokes are also really funny and he's generally much more jovial than expected.Julius Avery tries to make the stale scares more dynamic with lots of movement and it works. It helps that what the scares lack in terror they make up for in how gross they can be and it's run time flies by. The soundtrack surprisingly has some 80s rock gems, they're only present for a few seconds but the film would still be weaker without them.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","manuelasaez","17 August 2023","Let's face it, Exorcist movies are the same no matter who makes them, especially when they center around Catholicism's ideas of demons and hell. Aside from there being accounts of demonic possession in every culture and almost every religion, they continue to focus on Catholicism's lame interpretation of it and at this point, it's laughable. The same basic setup, the same priests spewing the same nonsense verbatim (and i'm not talking about the actual words of God and Bible. Those are not nonsense, at all). You'd think they'd make a story concerning any other Christian sect or denomination, for varieties sake, but they continue to choose this one. Pentecostals, for example, have an exorcism a week in any church, and you don't need clearance from any ""pope"" to perform them. Anyone with a solid and infallible faith can exercise a demon. Why they haven't made a movie about this is baffling to me, but I digress....This movie is a very paint-by-numbers exorcism movie. Rogue priest, possessed child, demon calls for said priest, exorcism is performed, everyone survives, end of movie. This formula is the same one that most people, including myself, are absolutely exhausted by. There is nothing to differentiate this movie from the dozens of catholic exorcism films that have come before it, except....this movie like a freaking Michael Bay movie.People are thrown all over the place, people float, projectile blood, explosions. I'm surprised there wasn't a scene where the exorcist jumped over an explosion in a Motorcycle. Even the script was like a Bay movie; so many one-liners and attempts at comedy, that I didn't know whether to be concerned or to actually laugh. Demonic possession should never be comical, but I guess that's where society is right now, isn't it? I mean, Satan is everywhere these days, so why shouldn't he poke fun at himself?I watched the movie in its entirety not because I liked the movi (and I rolled my eyes more times than I could count while watching it), but because of its absurdity. It's like watching that one drunk girl at a party; you kind of feel sorry for her, since you've seen so many like her before, but you'll be damned if you aren't watching her make every mistake all the others have made while you check off each one in an imaginary list. This movie was validation that Hollywood continues to be a creatively bankrupt cesspool of nonsense, and just because a movie gets you to see it all the way to the very end, it doesn't mean the movie was actually good. I will probably forget everything that happened in a few months time, and that kind of amnesia is welcomed.Watch this is you want to see what an Exorcism film would look like if it was directed by the guy who does the John Wick movies. Everyone else, avoid this. You won't remember anything about it after a few months, either.If you want a real interested and unique movie about demonic possession, watch the South Korean movie The Priests. Than one is actually very well made and actually scary.","

The Pope's Exorcist was kinda silly (Crowe made it watchable) but a passable one time and forget about watch. A mother and her two children move into somewhat of home type castle in Spain only to discover that the within the walls lies an evil demon which takes over her son (of course, been there done that in how many films already?) Anyway Russel Crowe the popes exorcist is sent for by the demon and sent forth by the church to investigate. He arrives at the home, the CGI on the demon possessed little boy goes into full effect, yada yada yada, you kinda know how the story ends. It felt more black comedy than horror (my opinion) and special effects bordered on the likes of the film Drag me to hell. Watch once and call it a day.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","waterietarte","26 October 2023","I love horror and particularly the haunted house/possessed child category. The Exorcist chilled me with its slow-developing horror, and when the eponymous series/sequel came out, it built on the mythology and included creepy sub-plots involving the Vatican and heart-wrenching moments as characters you had grown fond of were tortured by demons.This is not that.The Pope's Exorcist is a Greatest Hits of exorcism movie tropes, assembled clumsily around a thin plot and characters that are no more than copy-pasted archetypes (Newbie Priest, Widowed Mother, Rebellious Teen, Innocent Boy). Except for Father Gabriele, who comes off as a parody of a superhero: larger than life, cracking jokes, and going ""cuckoo"" at people as if that's somehow endearing. Apparently in-universe it is, because all the cardinals envy him while the Pope adores him so much that he somehow gets sick/possessed when Father Gabriele is in danger.If you're the kind of stickler who reads the trivia pages of movies (ie, me) you'll notice an avalanche of factual errors. The setting looks like anything but Castille, the Spaniards look anything but Spanish, characters randomly switch to English during important meetings in the Vatican (where Latin was the official language in 1987), and speaking of 1987... apart from some old cars/scooters and a Walkman, it absolutely doesn't feel like 1987. The MRI machine (with laser beams!) in the antiquated Spanish hospital in the middle of nowhere was particularly jarring.You could forgive these things if the rest of the movie wasn't both boring and just really silly. Several pivotal moments in the plot depend on the characters, including Father Gabriele, behaving like incompetent idiots. In general the plot seems to be built around special effects or ""scary"" tropes that needed to be included, and so these moments are brought about in contrived ways and are easy to predict. There is no suspense or tension, just the occasional gross-out moment.Then there's the possessed child. I see what they were going for: he has big innocent eyes and would work perfectly well as a Scary Little Kid. But he's not given any opportunity to actually be creepy before they cover him in weird makeup (Gollum) and dub him over (with very bad lip-sync) with the voice of a Disney Villain who literally goes ""rarrrrr"" when he's trying to roar scarily at characters. That is pretty much the scope of his power. ""Rarrr, I'm so evil"".I gave this 2 stars, because it did make me cringe and laugh, but unfortunately I cringed at the jokes and laughed at the ""scary"" scenes, which isn't what you're looking for when watching a horror movie.","

Instead it is just a drawn out story about a priest confronting his demons, both literal and metaphorical. Personally I found this movie very boring. The opening scene is good, albeit not scary, but it just goes downhill from there. It seemed like it written by either 3 different people or maybe AI as the movie is all over the place. You have a very cliche family where we first see the daughter has horrible teenage angst against her mom, only for that to never pop up again in the movie. You also have a side plot that explores the church possibly being evil and priests are corrupt like abusing minors only for that to get thrown out the window about 2/3rds in. Meanwhile our main character tries to confront his guilt of being in a war but never firing a shot, but then also his guilt of not treating some mentally disturbed who think they are possessed (but aren't because they are just crazy). It just seemed like the writers did not know what story they wanted to tell so they just through it all in and hoped for the best.","

Even Father Mirren's lovable quip ""Thank god my will is weak"" when he was offered brandy in the cold weather is transformed into a full-blown drunkard Father Amorth.The result is an unexpected caricature rendition of The Exorcist with overuse of all the common exorcism tropes, and profoundly weak writing, especially in everything related to the Pope character.It's a shame because the setup looked promising, with the Vatican intrigue and the abnormal Amorth character. But all that goes down hill so quickly.I think the makers weren't really going for a parody or a spoof. But cardboard characters, shallow plot and complete absence of any personality conflicts or philosophical themes made it what it is now.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","docdra","18 August 2023","Despite the title of my review, I don't think this was that great...or good.25 minutes in and I was wondering why I was still watching:1) Typical setup with the single mother raising two children after her spouse dies2) The older daughter is the typical sluttish rebellious teen that's angry at everything3) The younger son, the subject of the movie, is the quiet traumatized child4) They move into a dilapidated abbey/diocese that was left by the dead spouse - they're having it renovatedI could keep going, but already the tropes are stacking up, and so is the nonsense. In that first 25 minutes, the mother is walking around this castle-like building barefoot in her underwear, despite the fact that the building is under renovation, thus dirty and possibly dangerous. This is just the minor dumb stuff though.The pacing is so off, that again, in that first 25 minutes we're rushed into the younger child's possession, subsequent hospital visit with an MRI, spinal tap, and other nonsense before they send him home after labeling him a possible psychotic...all in one day apparently.Another issue - the film isn't horror. In fact, it doesn't know what it wants to be. There are splashes of comedy throughout the movie, as if they weren't sure if they should take the subject matter seriously or not. The comedy was detrimental to the overall seriousness of the subject matter itself, making you doubt what you were supposed to be feeling, thus the point of the entire movie. Ironically, however, or not, the humor makes this mediocre film a bit more palatable, as it distracts you from the nonsense otherwise taking place.If they had gone with a strictly serious tone, but better writing, or leaned more into the humor, then this could have been better. As it is, it just seems like they didn't know what they wanted to do - almost if they were setting this up for a franchise run. Where, instead of a typical action movie, they were shooting for a religious themed movie with cheap thrills - like exploding bodies...","

"The Pope's Exorcist","derek-e-coster","18 August 2023","I like Russell Crowe. He always looks his age unlike someone like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise and thought this looked promising although I'm not really a horror film fan. I'm not even that keen on The Exorcist to which all possession are compared to and rightly so.However, after a fairly promising start things go downhill very fast. Some pointless Vatican politics and a family that are used to build the exorcism and which could have been done so much better.Then a load of over the top special effects and an old hidden history of some exorcism hundreds of years ago and there you have it.Russell Crowe can and has done so much better. I just don't know what made him appear in this rubbish..","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Tweetienator","2 May 2023","I wasn't too disappointed that's the good news, but I wasn't much impressed either - The Pope's Exorcist got some production value and a solid working cast (the boy of course is no match for Linda Blair but she was and is one of the best acted possessed lost soul ever) but what the movie mostly lacks is timing and the feel for real horror - The Exorcist or the first Conjuring movie (and there are some other far stronger possession/exorcism movies around) just play in another league in that aspect. I never had a feeling of being afraid, had no goosebumps, no jump scare hit me - here fails the director to deliver, which of course is a great faux pas. The level on the horror-o-meter is just too tame: one of the reasons may be that the movie uses every clich√© imaginable of this kind of movies, especially the horror scenes are, well, nothing really new or too interesting. Also the talking of the devil is, most of the time, stupid and rather lame. I hope, for the sake of the script writer, that the King of the Damned will not seek revenge for that blasphemy ;) What else? Production is pro, settings nice, cast solid. Verdict: watchable, but no must-watch for the lover of the art of horror - something that will please a mainstream audience maybe more, I guess.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","trinaboice","31 October 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
The dark, religious drama was directed by Julius Avery, leading the team of screenwriters: Michael Petroni, Evan Spiliotopoulos, R. Dean McCreary, and Chester Hastings. The movie is loosely based on the life of Gabrielle Amorth, an Italian priest who was an exorcist of the Diocese of Rome. The story is based on files of the Catholic priest that revealed a secret the Vatican was trying to keep hidden.I've always found movies like this to be super creepy because I DO believe in the devil. Do you? Comment below!When I was a little girl, I remember hearing people talk about the movie The Exorcist but it wasn't something my parents would ever want to take me to, plus the thought of it scared me. I still have never seen it! Some are calling this movie The Da Vinci Code meets The Exorcist.THINGS I LIKED:
Russell Crowe is great in this role. I love that he's trying out his talents in different genres. We even get to hear him speak Italian, as well as English with an Italian accent. Despite the dark theme, he brings welcome humor to his character and the film. It was his idea to have Father Amorth ride a Vespa. Ha ha I got to ride a Vespa in Tuscany, Italy. I felt like such a local. üòä
The legendary Italian actor, Franco Nero, plays the Pope, although he's not in many scenes.The rest of the cast did a good job and includes Alex Essoe, Laurel Marsden, Ryan O'Grady, Cornell John, and more.I don't usually like horror movies and wouldn't have seen this movie except I like Russell Crowe and was curious about his role. This is the first time he's ever starred in a horror flick.We get to visit Italy and Spain! I lived in Spain twice back in the 1980s. I left a piece of my heart there.I thought the special effects were pretty good.If you enjoy this, you'll be happy to know that the ending allows for sequels to continue the story. In a weird way, I like watching Russell Crowe kick demon butt.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I always worry about young children in horror movies and how the roles might emotionally harm them. Young Peter DeSouza-Feighoney did an excellent job. One thing I don't like is watching young kids swear.Some viewers have said they don't think this movie is scary. I did but that's probably because I'm not used to watching horror movies and don't enjoy being scared.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is not appropriate for children's viewing.Some profanity, including F-bombs spoken by a young boy
Italian and Spanish are spoken with subtitles
We see two boys possessed by devils.A priest drinks alcohol.We see blood, gore, and skeletons.!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","AfricanBro","10 May 2023","I watched this last night and didn't hate it at the time, but after sleeping on it I realized this wasn't great at all. This should've been way more scary than it actually was, of which it wasn't. People used to be scared to watch horrors and that was the best part. This felt like it wasn't even trying, it's riddled with cliches. The aura wasn't even eerie, they just filmed in the dark I guess pray it has the desired effect. Didn't even have cheap scares. On that note however, it does seem like production budget was slim, so the makeup was great considering.The performances of the children aren't always convincing, that coupled with the dialogue that felt out of sorts, it had one liners that were intended to be scary but sound like they were written by a child. They were too on the nose and sometimes illogical. If your son throws a priest across the room I don't think you'd be surprised the church showing up. The characters were so unbelievable and flimsy.The story isn't anything new to the genre, added a few things in the side plots but otherwise still follows the same formula in the end. The backstory was a nice touch though. And Russell Crowe's performance elevated this to just about mediocre. I loved seeing the priest on the Ferrari Vespa, I don't know why but I was waiting for mattia binotto to show up.The last half hour isn't great, just waiting to wind down the clock. There wasn't a lot of places the story could go so it was pretty predictable. Russell Crowe was great in this and that's the only redeeming and inviting factor for most, but even that doesn't save the movie for me especially as a horror.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","movieman6-413-929510","10 April 2023","The Pope's Exorcist is a new horror drama directed by Overlord director Julius Avery. The film is based on the life and stories of the Italian priest Gabrielle Amorth, exorcist of the diocese of Rome.Father Gabriel Amorth (Russell Crowe), head of exorcism at the Vatican, is confronted with his own past and the secret past of the Vatican during an investigation into the occupying Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney).In order to save Henry from the demon that has taken over him, deal with his own demons from his past with father Amorth and further uncover the hidden secrets of the Vatican.This is the first horror film in which Russell Crowe plays a part and has also dealt with ideas at the front of the film. Although this is Russell Crowe's first horror film, the film itself is a standard horror exorcism film. For connoisseurs of such films, the film itself can quickly come across as familiar or obvious.The film is also filled with horror clich√©s, where stupid characters will jump at any strange sound and then simply ask: Hello, is anyone there? Because of such clich√©s, the film itself is no longer really scary or exciting.Russell Crowe also comes across as a standard priest for his first horror film, trying to exorcise evil demons. He only often uses jokes and comic remarks, which can seem a bit contradictory in the front of a horror film. The other characters also play more standard horror movie characters, who, thanks to their many clich√© mistakes, remain difficult to take seriously or to really care about as a viewer. For Peter DeSouza-Feighoney, this is only his first acting role in a film. Despite the fact that his possessed characters come across as a bit of a stereotype, he knows how to come across physically believable as a possessed person.The horror makeup looks good and believable in the movie. Later on, when they start using less believable visual effects, the movie effects lose all their credibility and come across as a bit weak.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Wikkid_Gamez","19 August 2023","Like others have said, most exorcism movies are basically the same and are a dime a dozen.... This one was much better than expected, I'm sorry I put off watching it for so long! I had stashed it in my rainy day movies as something to watch when I couldn't find anything else I thought would be better. As most movies like this don't do much for me as they are too predictable and similar. The only reason I even added this to my list was because of Russell Crowe, I knew if he was in it then it had to be at least watchable. Well, I finally got around to it, and found it completely engaging! The history mixed in making the story much deeper than usual. Add to that the excellent acting and visual with the overall atmosphere the movie held and I would easily recommend this movie to others as well as watch it more than one in a decade myself, which is unusual for me, I don't watch most movies in the horror genre more than once every 10-15 years as I like not knowing what will happen because lets face it, most horror movies don't have much substance. I still love them, but they don't usually hold my attention beyond that first watch. Well, this one actually had more substance and I will definitely be watching it again, probably add it to our list of movies to watch around Halloween! A truly engaging and enjoyable experience! I actually kinda hope they decide to make a follow up sequel, that said I am probably asking for trouble even saying that as most sequels are beyond disappointing... But here's to hoping!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","neolier-1","14 April 2023","How did heck did they get Russell Crowe to star in this movie? Beyond my understanding. Poorly written, terrible acting, and judging by the ending, a lame attempt to start a franchise?This is more a (bad) fantasy flick rather than a horror movie. Flat plot combined with average special effects that don't help to create impact on the viewer, who far from feeling tension or scared feels more bored than anything else.If you like horror movies like The Witch, The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Midsommar, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, etc., the stay away from this movie and avoid the disappointment.","

I thought he did a pretty decent job with his Italian accent and his jests towards the other languages.

Russell Crowe, one of the finest actors is incredible in the role. If your looking for Hollywood horror gore this isn't the movie. This carries more suspense then horror gore but more focused on the story and great acting. The lines , script were given great detail and delivery. Nothing campy about this movie but well worth it. Now hopefully there were be sequels as fans of the movie would most likely want to know more about Father Amorth and the challenges he faced. As for the set designed, was perfect they put a lot of effort into this movie and it paid off.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","whitetowel-74786","12 May 2023","Ah yes, dear old (portly) Russell Crowe is back in Rome folks, only this time he's taking on the devil as... you guessed it... the Pope's Exorcist!Pleased to say the Crowe-man is back on top form here, drinking espressos, telling corny jokes and riding around on his vespa scooter in full priests garb with his trusty bag of anti-christ tricks strapped to the back.After a decent start sets the tone, at the behest of his boss back at Vatican HQ - the Pope, Crowe heads to a creepy rundown Spanish castle where a young boy has been possessed by a particularly evil entity, and so the plot thickens as the blood, thunder and numerous nods to Friedkin's benchmark 1973 flick The Exorcist ensue.The main plot (involving Vatican cover-ups) and many sub-plots just about manage to hold your attention, but the film starts to plod in places with too much downtime talk and unecessary backstory between the two exorcising priests (shout out to Daniel Zovatto as Russell's reluctant sidekick), which somewhat interrupts the focus and flow... as do The numerous subtitles due to different languages being used.Then in the final third things get pretty whacky, while the finale itself straddles the fine line between exciting and ott parody.Aside from a top performance from Russell Crowe (and indeed the entire supporting cast), the feel, lighting, cinematography, music and effects are all worthy of praise. However the overall screenplay is just not solid enough to sing it to the heavens.Based on the true stories of long serving lead Vatican Exorcist Father Gabriel Amorth, the film sets itself up for a sequel or two, so assuming it's a big enough hit, we could be seeing a hero rise from Rome once again... well, why the hell not....","

"The Pope's Exorcist","kuner-59029","13 May 2023","This film isn't shy about what it's trying to be. A modern Exorcist, a classic that does everything the Exorcist did, but bigger, badder, with a message, some history etc.They have an older and a younger priest like in The Exorcist, they set up a token tragic backstory for Russel Crowe's character, they set up a tragic backstory for the possessed kid and some stuff about the church burying (literally) secrets of the Spanish Inquisition.It's supposed to be meaningful, but it's painting by the numbers, and none of it amounts to anything other than actors making silly faces and screaming a lot, as is customary in these possession movies.If that's your thing or you really love demon or religious horror films, then this may be for you. Russel Crowe is reliably good, though his Italian accent never really works. The actors of the family are all good and Franco Nero is still alive and still great even if it's just a cameo role.You could do a lot worse than this when it comes to horror films. 4/10 is probably lower than it deserves, but with Russel Crowe and Franco Nero attached, I expected something smarter, but substantive than 2 hours of screaming.I will say it's neither woke and anti-Christian, nor is it pro-Christian propaganda nike Nefarious. It tries to be as neutral as possible with its subject matter, similar to the original Exorcist, although that film gave us a much better dynamic between the exorcists and didn't try to shove in some pseudo-historic mystery aspect. That really ruins the film, since it makes the narrative plot driven instead of character driven like the classic.I was thoroughly bored.","

The lack of real jump scares really takes down my score for this film I did not jump once we don't even get the cheap kill scare of a bird flying up. The family in the film I had no sympathy for what so ever I think we need more back story to them and also more back story for ""the dead girl""One positive for this film is Russell Crowe, I think he does a good performance and makes the character of Father Gabriele Amorth very likeable and they get a few funny moments in there but overall I was disappointed 4/10.","

How it was different from the glut of cheesy, sub-standard possession movies we've had our fill of in the last couple of decades. How an actor of Crowe's gravitas gives it an extra veneer of quality, and how it has far more depth than you'd expect for a horror film. Did I just watch a different movie? None of that turns out to be true. This is simply another cheesy, generic and predictable possession flick full of the usual gooey FX and OTT demonic voices that have been filling our screens ever since THE EXORCIST came out. The worst thing about it is the direction, from the guy who did the decent OVERLORD no less, which is so camp as to be ridiculous.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","paul_haakonsen","4 May 2023","Well, I have to say that director Julius Avery's 2023 movie ""The Pope's Exorcist"" wasn't too shabby for an exorcism movie. I had initially thought that it was going to be just another run-of-the-mill attempt at making an exorcism movie, so I hadn't cranked up my hopes for the movie.But with it being a horror movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I found the time to sit down and watch it. And I have to say that I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the 103 minutes that the movie ran for. And on that account, then I can warmly recommend you to sit down and watch ""The Pope's Exorcist"", especially if you enjoy exorcism movies.The storyline in the movie was good, though it was a fairly straight forward demonic possession and exorcism story, if you look at it objectively. But there were some nice twists to the narrative along the way. I definitely enjoyed what writers Michael Petroni, Evan Spiliotopoulos, R. Dean McCreary, Chester Hastings and Jeff Katz managed to put together based on the works Gabriele Amorth's books.Leading actor Russell Crowe was actually quite nicely cast for the role of Father Gabriel Amorth and carried the movie nicely with his performance. And young actor Peter DeSouza-Feighoney was outstanding as the demonically possessed Henry.Something that really worked well in favor of the movie, was the atmosphere that director Julius Avery managed to pull off, and the intensity of the possession and the powers of the demonic entity. That really added a lot of layers to the movie.Visually then the movie had quite good special effects.""The Pope's Exorcist"" is a very enjoyable exorcism film, and it is one that I definitely recommend.My rating of ""The Pope's Exorcist"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","kevin_robbins","13 July 2023","The Pope's Exorcist (2023) is a movie that I recently watched on a flight. The storyline follows Gabriele Amorth, who was an Italian priest in real life and reported directly to the Pope. He was an expert on demons and was only given special assignments by the Vatican. We follow a special case he is given that unlocks secrets that have been inside the Vatican for centuries. As he works this case he begins meeting the people that will one day help him put together the Association of Exorcists, which was/is also a real group within the Vatican.This movie is directed by Julius Avery (Overlord) and stars Russell Crowe (Gladiator), Daniel Zovatto (Don't Breath), Alex Essoe (Midnight Mass), Franco Nero (Django) and Peter DeSouza-Feighoney (The Girl with the Metal Heart).I actually liked aspects of this more than I thought I would. Russell Crowe was actually pretty good in this. His mannerisms and dialogue were entertaining and he looked the part. Zovatto delivers a solid supporting performance and Peter DeSouza-Feighoney delivers a great child performance. The exorcism scenes are very good and the makeup and effects during those sequences were top notch...we just needed more of them. The storyline was interesting, primarily because it was based on a true story, and the settings and backdrops were perfectly selected. The ending relied a bit too much on CGI but was still entertaining and rewarding in its own way. It definitely set up well for a sequel.Overall, this isn't the Conjuring by any means, but it is worth a watch for fans of exorcism films. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend watching it once.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","frank-liesenborgs","16 April 2023","""The Pope's Exorcist"" may not be considered as the best exorcism movie of all time, but it certainly stands out from the rest that have tried to explore this intriguing subject in recent years. This film claims to be ""inspired by Vatican files,"" and although the degree of factual accuracy may be up for debate, it delivers a gripping and engaging possession story that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The true highlight of this film is undoubtedly the performance of Russell Crowe, who delivers a powerful and nuanced portrayal of his character. Crowe's charisma and sense of humor bring an added dimension to the movie, making his character both likeable and believable. It's refreshing to see such a talented actor take on an unconventional role like this one, and he does not disappoint. The story itself is a breath of fresh air from the run-of-the-mill exorcism movies that have flooded the market in recent years. The dialogues are well-written and natural, delivered with a nice dose of humor. The soundtrack is fitting, and the cinematography and locations are a feast for the eyes. The practical effects and gore add a touch of old-school horror, which is always welcome. Sure, the digital special effects may not be perfect in a few scenes, but this does not detract from the overall quality of the film. ""The Pope's Exorcist"" manages to keep viewers thoroughly entertained throughout its runtime, and that's what matters most. If you are looking for something different, then this film is worth checking out. Two thumbs up for this one!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","benjaminskylerhill","14 April 2023","We live in a world where there have been thousands of demon possession horror films, and most of them suck. Nearly every one of them has taken elements from the few good ones and butchered them in execution.Tropes abound in these films, and they almost never have anything interesting to say and never do a single original nor compelling thing throughout their entire runtimes.This is not one of those movies, thankfully.Granted, it does make use of tropes and all of the more action-heavy scenes are full of cliches and visual ""tricks"" that got old about 30 years ago.But The Pope's Exorcist's screenplay is significantly more interesting than I expected it to be. It fleshes out the two main priest characters as human beings and plays with the relationship between guilt and personal faith to shockingly effective results.I became invested in these characters' success because I wanted them to overcome their pasts. This rarely happens to me when I watch movies like this.I was also impressed with Julius Avery's direction. He uses some very clever tricks with the camera to place the characters' emotional stare at the center of the action so the film never becomes tiresome to look at and certainly never gets boring.That's not to say that the film is great or revolutionary, though. Although Russell Crowe's performance helps keep the movie afloat, the story doesn't do anything new and the climax plays out in the exact same overly dramatised, melodramatic way that all of these possession movies play out.It builds up some intriguing concepts, but it didn't stick the landing with them in a way that would've been memorable.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Ruslanwashere","16 April 2023","Loved the movie! It's witty, dark and enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and this one was just perfect. Definitely more a mystical thriller with religious motives. Left the theater with a smile on my face.I think a sense of humor is what most of the movies lack today. Not Marvel stupid corny jokes, but a real witty humor. For me personally this was one of the major driving forces of the picture. You don't generally see that people laugh several times during a horror movie.Sense of humor, charm and charisma will go along way, when you're tasked with playing a priest exorcist. It's not what people would expect, and it's perfect.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","masonfisk","16 September 2023","An out & out further theft of 1973's The Exorcist comes in this recent release starring Oscar winner Russell Crowe. Crowe is the Vatican's head exorcist sent out when things get really bad which happens when a single mother, Alex Essoe (from Doctor Sleep) & her kids, Carrie Munro & Peter DeSouza-Feighoney, descend upon an old property they've bought which turns out to be the hub of demonic activity. DeSouza-Feighoney gets his Linda Blair on as he's possessed going down the checklist (body contortions, profanity laced tirades to onlookers, facial scars, etc.) before Crowe shows up abetted by a local priest, Daniel Zovatto, who get the assignment of their lives while the Pope back in his papal surroundings, Franco Nero, sits back & awaits the outcome. Slavish to its theft of the original granddaddy of possession pictures, one wonders if even the filmmakers were bored on set making this thing because I sure was while watching it which feels so passed its sell by date, you'd be surprised the finished product wasn't unearthed in an Egyptian tomb.","

The plot is good, and even if it messes just a bit with real history, it is compelling and open the doors to so many possibilities.This is not a generic film, and the main character is truly the star.At the end, there is something that ends up giving some doubts, but that should be something for a second film.The most important thing is that the movie is food and the ending is satisfactory.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Matt-Dawg420","8 May 2023","Now I don't believe in God or demonic possession my self (that's my belief) and hearing that this was based on a ""true story"" kinda makes it hard to believe it happened in real life, but as a movie, I enjoyed it a lot, the graphic depictions of possession, not as dramatic as The Exorcist 1973, but still good effects. Russell Crowe is quite the actor, watching him copy the behaviors and mannerism of exorcists and men of the church was kinda interesting to entangle that into his character role, gotta appreciate the lengths these actors go to to achieve that persona and make the audience believe. All in all, I'd say this is a decent movie, probably worth an Oscar or 2, maybe an Emmy, but was this movie ""The Best Worldwide"" I wouldn't say so, I just enjoy the movie for what it is.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","mschrists","6 May 2023","This is my first review of a film ever and probably the last too.Horror films are my favorite and I pretty much have seen most of them with knowing well what to expect, especially from exorcisms films like this.The scenario was always the same, what the priest full with hidden sins wasn't able to do, was done from film's main character. Pretty much Church and religion is weak against evil and at the end somehow someone who didn't use to believe, would make the come back and save the day...NOT THIS TIME!! Finally (and I challenge EVERYONE out there to prove me wrong), the priest won the daemon with his faith and broke the tradition, thank you!!!No matter if someone believes or not in any religion, this was starting to become boring and very repeating, so this movie was a pleasant surprise after 30 years of the same scenario.I really hope that they will produce many more films based on this one afterwards.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Meaningless_Signifier","19 August 2023","Russell Crowe carries much of the weight with his performance (I'm not a good judge of accents, so I can't comment on that aspect).The film seems well budgeted, and many of the purely technical aspects are fairly good, but the writing is mostly by-the-numbers, an adequate but rather bland facsimile. It tries to pack in so much, but most of the material lacks anticipation or tension, while many of the possession scenes border on outright comedy.It's hard to do something truly original. The real problem isn't imitation itself, but rather imitation which fails to truly elevate, enhance or stand out.","

Spoooky.I enjoyed seeing Gab ride around on his Vesper and the humor was decent.I don't know how directors/writers get away with this crap, and how companies even approve this trash. Like do they not watch it before releasing?? Unless you have literally never seen a horror or your extent of horror is equivalent of like the ghostbusters, I don't see how anyone can see the thrill or fear in this. I would also like to add that this is a classic example of how relying on cgi to create your movies just doesn't work, the only exception to this is if the cgi team are actually not brain-dead monkeys.","

I did a search on The Spanish Inquisition and its symbols/icons/seals/emblems thinking that the Game Designers might have taken inspiration from an original, medieval symbol, but nothing close came up. But the 'seal' the film uses is the EXACT COPY of Dragon Age: Inquisition's. It's likely a production staff just googled 'Inquisition Seal', and the Dragon Age T-shirts and stickers came up, so they just used it carelessly, with no one on set having ever played the game to realize the plagiarism. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm predicting a copyright strike.Anyway, I didn't like the film. Bad exposition. Too predictable. Bad demon big villain voice. Too many tropes. Too many CGI tropes even. The elongated 'The Mummy' mouth has been done a thousand times and now it's just cringe.Only good thing is Russell Crowe's inherent presence and charm.","

Only Franco Nero escaped this unscathed- all the other actors (sans Crowe) turned in boring and one dimensional performances. The direction was basic with nothing to raise your interest.

Which is another area where this movie kind of lacked. The dialogue is pretty not-so-good. It was like when you finish writing an essay, but you haven't met the minimum word count requirement, so you go back and make sentences long and unnecessary. The dialogue was like that. And the scary exorcist parts...were pretty redundant and contrived. Force-choke here, spider-climb up a wall there. Really just going down the list for an exorcist movie and checking the boxes.

It's not funny but it's not not funny either.

"The Pope's Exorcist","lee-96696","23 August 2023","This film is a strictly paint-by-the-numbers exorcism film, so I will not waste much time on the plot. The only highlight: Russel Crowe.It is set in 1987, in Castile, Spain. The basics: an American widow and her two kids -- a negative, bratty teenage girl, and a young boy maybe age eight -- come to an old monastery her recently deceased husband had left her. She's having it renovated with the intention of selling it for a big profit so that her family has some income. Strange things start to happen, and, you guessed it, full on possession of the little boy. (Too bad it is not the I-hate-everything girl).Who do you call? Yes, Father Amorth (Russel Crowe), the master exorcist and friend of the Pope. He teams up with a local priest, a young and somewhat teen-idol-looking Father Esquibel. I will let the reader guess the progression of the story. There are political shenanigans at the Vatican, research and manuscripts at the Vatican archives (Trinity College's Library in Dublin fills in here -- it has been used for Harry Potter films) and some routine exorcism special effects. You are quickly delivered -- it is paced like a television show -- to a fairly predictable outcome albeit with some twists and reveals and one or two unexplained matters, specifically the motivations of a very young Cardinal from America. He reminded me of the Jude Law character in The Young Pope an old HBO series.So it's a mildly diverting, not very challenging hour and a half. Good for a stressed out weeknight. But what makes this movie stand out is Russel Crowe's performance. He takes what the writers have given him and turned it into a likable, engaging character. This exorcist has a sense of humor melded with understandable world weariness. I may need to watch, re-watch some other Russel Crowe films.If I were a betting person, I'd say this movie is a set up for a series or sequel. There is the ""cop buddy"" vibe of Amorth and Esquibel. The loose ends at the Vatican just scream to be explained in greater detail. I for one, see trouble brewing with the American cardinal.","

His quality was not on show anywhere here and the sound mix made him often hard to understand anyway. The funniest moment actually comes at the end when it's clear what the producers had in mind / held out a forlorn hope for.If you like films on this subject, are not turned off by anything Dan Brown-ish and don't expect much, this film will happily kill 90 minutes or so for you.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","BJG-Reviews","7 May 2023","The stage curtains open ...Father Esquibel: ""Let's go to work.""
Father Amorth: ""Let's go to Hell.""""The Pope's Exorcist"" (2023) starring Russell Crowe and Daniel Zovatto is a loosely based film on the true life story of Father Gabriele Amorth, who was a Catholic Priest and an Exorcist for the Diocese of Rome which is under the direct jurisdiction of the Pope - hence, the title of the movie. I really didn't know what to expect coming in, other than your usual exorcist-type stuff (prayers in chaotic situations from priests standing over a restrained possessed individual tied to a bed). We certainly got that ... and a whole lot more.Father Gabriele Amorth (Crowe) is being questioned about his methods as an exorcist, one who is perceived as being a bit of a rogue and independent, taking matters into his own hands without receiving the required approvals needed first. But, when a little boy is possessed by a rather strong demon in an abbey in Spain, he is assigned firsthand by the Pope himself to go and investigate, as this particular location has been a sore spot for the church in the past. Expecting this to be the 'usual' situation, Father Amorth finds that this may be the biggest challenge he's ever faced, maybe even at the cost of his own life. This is no small deal ... this is something that could destroy everything he knows and bring the church to its knees. All they need is the demon's name ... without it, they are doomed.Curious, I did a little research on the actual priest that this movie was based on, and coincidentally enough, he has been described as the ""James Bond of exorcists"". I say that is coicidental because, after the movie ended, that is EXACTLY what I was thinking. ""I'm Amorth. Gabriele Amorth. I am Double O - 666. License to exorcise."" I was thinking to myself that if James Bond were an exorcist, this is how he'd be. There is very little to none with the scare factor here. It is heavy on the intrigue, the investigation that leads us to a solemn secret, and tons of special effects and action. We get a lot of the usual cliche'd dialogue lines such as 'God works in mysterious ways', and the like. As well as a formidable demonic force to be defeated.This wasn't a bad movie, per se. If you are going in expecting a good, scary horror film ... this is not it. Some of the situations were even borderline laughable, but the cinematography was excellent, and Russell Crowe carries the film remarkably, as he often does. I wouldn't recommend it, but I feel it is worth a watch at a rating of 6 stars out of 10. ""The Pope's Exorcist"" will keep you engaged and interested. It won't scare you, but it will entertain you.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Skruffbagg","29 October 2023","The is the second exorcism themed movie I've watched in the last week and is, by far, the more entertaining one.I can't help but compare this to The Exorcist: Believer, which is pointless, tensionless and dull. This is a far better movie, but is essentially a fairly routine horror elevated by a hugely entertaining and engaging performance by Russell Crowe, who is clearly having a blast playing the Vatican's Chief Exorcist, Gabriele Amorth (a real person - look him up).In the film, a mother and her 2 children move from America to Spain to take possession of a spooky old abbey, bequeathed to them in her late husband's will after he is killed in a car accident that the youngest child Henry was in, rendering him traumatised and mute. Whilst exploring the ruins, Henry disturbs a creepy door behind a crumbling wall, is promotly possessed by a demon and requests a priest - but he only means one in particular. Enter scooter riding, secret boozing, bantering Father Amorth, to investigate and help the family.The set up is short and to the point, there's no time wasted in getting to what we all came for - exorcism fun times! Brevity is the soul of wit, after all.The exorcism, subsequent investigation into the abbey's sinister history, and build up to the finale is all pretty good, I can't really fault it. The plot is very basic and the cast are all ok, but Crowe chews the scenery and steals the show, making an otherwise standard scary film very watchable. It's not going to frighten anyone who watches supernatural horror regularly, but I've definitely seen worse this year and would give it a light recommendation.My one major criticism is the ridiculous and slightly hilarious sequel-bait in the last 5 minutes, which felt like they were trying to set up a 'Conjuring' style exorcist universe and made me chuckle. I turned to my partner in this moment and said ""The Pope's Exorcist 2: This Time It's Personal""Stick it on, you could do a lot worse.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","FixedYourEnding","26 May 2023","Father Gabriel Amorth (Russel Crowe) is the head Exorcist for the Vatican. Apparently that is something that exists and even a first-person book memoirs written about that. There is even a more documentary style movie featuring the read father Amorth (""The Devil and Father Amorth"" from 2017), however that one got a horrid review on IMDB, so I was satisfied with watching the trailer.Obviously the fictional version of ""The Pope's Excorcist"" is much more fun to watch than the real thing. Crowe looks nothing like the real Amorth but somehow with his demeanor, the white beard and the duality between him and the church, he becomes a true protagonist. His apprentice, Father Esquibel (played by Daniel Zovatto) is a great character of a young priest who made some missteps along the way, but in it by itself does not add much to this film.The kind of sums up what is good in this movie, maybe other than the first scene (featured on the trailer as well) which is smart, a little funny and surprising, but unfortunately this trend doesn't carry on to the rest of the movie, which instead, is unimaginative dribble to down-right boring. I don't know if it's just me, but seeing a 12 year-old curse at an older man is not scary to me, no matter how bad of a dental work the makeup team arranged for him.Other than the fact that you do end up caring for the main character, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" fails to create any further emotion for the rest of the characters, or any kind of fear for that matter, which as a horror film seems should have been a goal for the director. So, a horror film that is not scary and actually kind of laughable, I don't think this is was the director was shooting for. On top of that we see all the usual stuff that we see in exorcist movies, demons with robotic voice, objects flying, upside-down cross, reciting of the verses, it's all been there, seen that kind of stuff.The movie is rated 'R' but genuinely is not scarier than movies like ""Pray for the Devil"" (which is rated PG-13 and I also reviewed recently) and better in that respect. In other words, I was expecting a lot more under an 'R' rating. I would recommend if you want to watch Russel Crowe in a good role, but otherwise very skippable. Exact score: 53 / 100.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","lroyce-48163","1 September 2023","There were things I liked about this movie. Russell Crowe tooling about on his Vespa-like vehicle, toolbox of exorcism paraphernalia strapped to the side, on his way to fight demons. Crowe's character is based on an actual exorcist who died in 2016. Wonder what he would have thought of this
Crowe appears before The Anti-Exorcisms-Without-Permission-Board where a snot-nosed cardinal (bishop?) tries to take him down. Not happening! Crowe's character even leaves before the meeting is over! The audacity! We have never seen this before...well, maybe a few times
The little boy who winds up being possessed by Asmodeus is very good.This movie borrows a lot from previous exorcism movies:
Furniture flying through the air
People flying through the air
Writing on the boy's stomach...but wait! It's not the cold raised letters of The Exorcist! The letter are red. Completely different
Lots and lots of growling
It's okay...just okay.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Kulin33","16 April 2023","This movie was so much more and different than what I had imagined, it's not a jump scare but has its fare share of movements.Russell Crowe does an amazing job as the lead in the movie, this is his first horror film in a long time. I mean this character literally rides Vespa and fights devils while drinking whiskey! Yeah you heard it rightThe story is very engaging and VFX are very good as well, it's more on the realistic side rather than your typical horror movie with jump scares. The movie can be a let down for some viewers as they don't get enough scares to experience.It's something new and fresh according to me which can be enjoyed on the big screen near you.Follow Play & Pause on Instagram for more authentic reviews.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","MartianTom","17 July 2023","Actually, you can leave the last two words off the title of this review, and the remainder will say enough. Huge ones!Ah... once again, I was conned by the 'above 6' rating on IMDb. All of those above 5 can really only have been given by reviewers for whom computer games or Marvel films give a satisfying level of dramatic engagement and plot complexity.To be fair, I've always rather liked Russell Crowe as an actor, feeling that he always brings a certain gravitas to his roles. He was certainly the best thing in this film - apart from The Cult's 'She Sells Sanctuary' on the soundtrack at the beginning. Sadly, though, even an actor of his quality couldn't save this abysmal mess - the product of a juvenile script and a director who thought that some whizz-bang CGI set pieces would make up for lack of plot, character development, and just about everything else. Every cliche you could expect was here - including the 'jump scares' which weren't 'jumpy' at all, given that we've seen them so many times before. Then the others, in predictable order: the possessed child, the slamming doors, the leaping cupboards, the bouncing beds. And why must demons always have that deep, guttural voice - part tenor, part wolf, part lion growling through a megaphone? How about an occasional castrato falsetto?On the subject of characters - there wasn't a single sympathetic one amongst the whole lot. I just wanted all of them to die, and horribly - perhaps with the exception of Crowe's. The performances - apart from moments with Crowe's, and perhaps the boy's - were uniformly terrible. Who cast this lot? Who scripted their words? Who gave the whole thing the green light in the first place? As a drama, it's laughable. As a comedy, it's unfunny. I don't think it really knows what it is. Nor does anyone involved in it.Give it a miss and watch the original 'The Exorcist' instead. Once you've seen that, you've seen all you need to - and you can leave rubbish like this to the kids.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","dissanctus","14 July 2023","I started out moderately intrigued, as Russel Crowe managed to convince me that his humorous gruff exorcist might be a worthy character to follow forwards. Everything soon fell apart into a shambling overblown mish-mash of every exorcism trope possible, and I quickly became bored of the family we didn't know or care about standing around while the usual cross-waving prayer shouting nonsense carried on. The young lad did a gutsy performance but the whole thing never presented any palpable sense of menace, believability or realism, in fact I felt like I was watching an unnecessarily long episode of Creepshow. By the end I was more interested in my toasted cheese sandwich than the screen, where characters were flying about in some completely nonsensical CGI comedy. In short, dreadful. It's convinced me more than ever that the whole possession theme is completely milked dry and has nothing new to offer. This was no ""The Exorcist"", not by a long shot, and even the vaguely Catholic moralising felt pointless, shallow, perfunctory. I wasted 7 bucks on this but I don't mind if it puts me off future gambles with anything similar.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","elvisvkolaj","21 April 2023","I have been waiting for a movie like this.A smooth horror film, no need for jumpscares, a good scenario and a great character. In my opinion the scenario could have been expanded a little bit more and be more ""mysterious"" due to the nature of the investigation taking place in the movie, let along that Russel C. Is not starring everyday in such films so viewers could have watched more of it. Great character, nice antithesis with the nature of his purpose. Yes, it is the classic exorcist movie plot but you knew that before you watch the movie, as an answer to critics commenting ""the same old exorcist story"".Movie was really enjoyable.RC's acting wasn't not on point, based on his accent, but I cannot think of someone else that could have nailed the Italian accent and be an actor of this caliber.(Who Al Pacino ???)
It's not a 10/10 but it definitely deserves a lot more than what it is.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","jonny_","17 April 2023","The first two thirds of this movie were actually an interesting and refreshing treat, the acting from Russell Crowe and Daniel Zovatto is honestly excellent from start to finish.Russell Crowe in particular gives his best effort since American Gangster and it really shows. He's showing off a range of emotions, accents and a good sense of humour in a movie that could easily have been instantly forgettable.The real setback is the ending, it's actually still a little satisfying storywise but the tone shifts quite a bit and it doesn't fit in with what the rest of the movie set up. It moves from moody intrigue and mystery to the more generic visual gore/horror which was a bit of a let down. It doesn't ruin it, but it definitely doesn't give the payoff you hope for.","

Then he's scurrying out of the boy's room while grabbing his religious crap with his mouth opened üòØ in fear. Are you serious?! LolHow the mom was never nearby to make sure a priest, of all people, knew what he was doing to her seriously ill son, but instead remaining downstairs in that gigantic dusty mansion made no sense.The young priest couldnt act, and when he was hurled across and out of that large room by demon boy into that big armoire against the wall in their hallway, he should have at least ended up in a hospital or needing a walking cane for a few days.Why can't directors, writers, etc... make intelligent horrors like in the days of ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Omen"" or even ""Bad Seed""? GeeezUs!Women Directors are creating some great films thou.And just seeing Catholic Priests üëÄ in a movie is terrifying just by itself lol, where I'd enjoy it if it was about them getting their tongues cut out, hands chopped off and other limbs too by abused deceased kids that are now slowly possessing Nuns, now that would be a great horror, eh?I'm sure vegans didn't appreciate the beginning scene.

"The Pope's Exorcist","privatck","10 October 2023","Of course, the possessed boy in the movie listens to Metal right before being possessed. How else could you possibly satisfy religious prudery and outdated clich√©s at the same time? The movie is based on the memoirs written by a guy that thought yoga and Harry Potter were Satan's work.I'm really really tired of horror movies solving problems like so-called possessions and hauntings by the help of ""good old Catholic religion"". By claiming at least some of this was real (memoirs!), it glorifies exorcisms and therefore the refusal to get ""possessed"" people the help they actually need. The movie tries to overcome the church's old-fashioned image by making a somewhat cool and rebellious man main character. But this character's actually based on someone who really hurt and endangered people, reducing their suffering to a religious issue. I'd rather not glorify a man like this and impute him with heroic actions.","

It's so bad. It's so good! Wonderful hilarity.If you know that it's based on the ""true stories"" of a real life Catholic dude it makes it even better imagining the mundane reality that was embellished by this guy to make himself the hero of the story.The ending of the movie has the funniest text overlay. Not really a spoiler but be warned in case you're extra sensitive. Russell Crowe wrote books about his exorcisms. THE BOOKS ARE GOOD. Those last 4 words are exactly what is written on screen.

"The Pope's Exorcist","adamblackshaw-14445","19 April 2023","THE POPE'S EXORCIST is truly a silly film. Not at all scary apart from a few 'jump scares'. It makes THE DA VINCI CODE look like a masterpiece and isn't a patch on THE NAME OF THE ROSE or even the original THE EXORCIST. I make these comparisons bc I was really hoping for so much more. I like a good mystery amidst the pomp and glitter of the Catholic Church. But it really doesn't come close.The real exorcist, Father Gabriele Amorth, has been used to create this totally predictable and fictional hogwash. We've seen these characters before. The innocent family heading to doom is from THE SHINING, the Father Gabriele Amorth character is Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing and his priest offsider is any number of ineffective wet priests from any number of movies. The 'possessed child' is no Linda Blair.Only one thing elevates it above 2 stars and that's Russell Crowe. He does his best with this unfortunate material. He really does fill the screen in the same way G√©rard Depardieu can. At 59yo he's looking the worse for wear these days but hey, he's an exorcist so I assume he's seen some stuff.Don't waste your time and money on this dross. I was laughing through most of it.It looks like they are wanting to turn this into a franchise. The ending suggests they could make another 199 films! God help us! That would make James Cameron feel inadequate lol.","

Honestly am supposed to make a practical opinion of my review but now i guess I'll just use this medium to express my appreciation towards the making of this movie to help accelerate the awareness of such being's that they actually exist but the faith in God is absolutely above all and we should not forget to confess your sins cause in the eyes of the Lord we all are naked as like the day you were born.

Alex Essoe needs a lot more studying and coaching. I found myself thoroughly distanced from the film just by her inability to show any emotion.Very little time given to the story, very little depth or thought put into dialog. The only actor who got decent dialog was Russell Crowe and even then his character's sarcastic wit is misplaced here.The director didn't care about any of this or he would have let the mother act like a mother. The sister? A Hollywood cliche'.Very disappointing. Russel Crowe deserved better. I felt bad that he took this and put so much work into it.

If you've seem a lot of exorcist films, then The Pope's Exorcist may feel like nothing new.Takes place in 1987 Father Gaberiele Amorth (Russell Crowe) is asked to perform an excorcism on a boy, but a mystery comes into play, has the demon knows him a little to well, and Amorth needs to know more about the demon in order to defeat m and save the boy, but the question is will he?The film is scary, but it never goes too over board. The film tries to focus on more a character study, and that is why you get such a memorable performance by Russell Crowe, a priest, whose past comes into play, of becoming his demons. All the rest of the cast are pretty good, but the boy is has equally has good has Crowe, he play it very scary has being possessed quite perfectly, almost steals the movie from Crowe. In the end I hope the movie teach us to never lose our faith in ourselves.","

Titular devil-battling priest Russell Crowe (looking the part but with a dodgy Italian accent) is the sent to a run-down Spanish abbey where American kid Peter DeSouza-Feighoney's been possessed by a demon that likes to snarl ""You're all going to die"" (sigh)... to the despair of mum Alex Essoe & sis Laurel Marssen (poor).

If you love exorcism movies you may enjoy this; otherwise you're likely to find it tedious and unoriginal. As usual a demon with a grandiose and convoluted plan to strike out at the RC Church possesses some kid who spends his days writhing around on a bed looking evil while making profane and threatening comments. You know from the outset where things are headed and the movie doesn't try anything particularly original. It's not frightening in the slightest; it doesn't even manage the disconcerting atmosphere of The Exorcist, a movie whose shocking elements are pretty dated and tame by current standards.","

Amorth had many supernatural experiences in his life, and they barely touched on his story at all. This could've been anyone's story, and I guess it was: I doubt this has any basis in anything to do with Fr. Amorth. What a missed opportunity.The dialogue was laughable, special effects eye-rolling, acting just plain bad. I'm surprised that Russell Crowe took an interest after looking at this disaster of a script. Think: The exorcist meets an American family with the stereotypical annoying disaffected teen daughter you've seen in countless bad movies...and set it in Europe in a scary old castle with skeletons in the basement.

I wish he could've had a decent cast to work with, but he didn't and as a result, he carried the entire movie. His Italian was on point and he played his part to perfection. Sadly, even Crowe couldn't have saved this one.

"The Pope's Exorcist","uberdonkey6","9 May 2023","Russell Crowe is a good actor with lots of charisma. The plot has some interest but isn't delivered well because there is too much action and special effects at the end. The same story, with the same actors, would have been better with subtle reveals and more feeling for the family suffering possession. It's like too many films today: action and special effects as a priority and the story and characterisation coming second. In many ways I feel it was a missed opportunity. I feel Russell Crowe could have done more with a more measured film. Some bits too much of a copy of 'the exorcist'. Are they tipping a hat to that film? Maybe, but creating emotion and an intriguing story line would have been better.So, yeh, watch the film. You won't hate it. However, it's not directed at an intellectual audience, probably for those around 16 or 17 years old. Crow could have done this film as a retirement project because while he's good, it's like the film was aching to provide more depth for him. I blame the modern Hollywood script and direction teams that have made this film too similar to any other adventure/horror film. A forgettable film but will pass the time if nothing else to do.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","rgkarim","15 April 2023","LIKES:The Setting
-The movie may not be the most on jump scares, but the setting does great work to help this.-The movie is dark, without being too dark, setting this ambience of foreboding doom that I absolutely loved when it came to the film, always showing the darkness with a hint of light.-Use of lighting paints the movie in a horror tone, and though some of the lighting makes no sense in terms of story, I appreciated what they did to make this movie pop.-The Abbey has great feel of being abandoned and the conclave for this entire ordeal, while the church has this majesty and regal atmosphere when we are there to sort of counterbalance it.-This scenery is much of the thriller feel for this reviewer, and the movie theater adds a little ambience to help things out.The Special Effects
-While not the movie with the biggest wow factor, I do admit I loved what they did in terms of making this movie come to life.-The Sound editing is tops for most of the film, each element layering to be a tad creepy and disturbing, and then builds up much more horrifying sounds that work well with the music.-I'll group the music in this, but the orchestra work feels like a play back to the movies of the 80s-90s, but now with more definition and gruesome moments that make it more powerful.-The visual effects arise to really start being a nice touch, blood looking much more realistic than some movies, while the powers of the demon really get these well-blended touches that I can't say much about, but work well.-Even during the CGI heavy moments, the visuals hold well, a tad fake here and there, but otherwise showing how the marriage of real and computer are the best hybrids for making something come to life.-And for the makeup, well dang. I just love seeing these transformations, augmented by CGI, but really bringing this punch that works to make these gruesome, nightmarish scenes really stand out and get under my skin.-Amazing.The Acting/Voice Acting
-Ralph Ineson is the voice of the demon, and I think he knocked it out of the park. While it is certainly not the most unique voice, the dude has the emotions, inflections, and menace to sell the big bad antagonist of the film.-Shout out to Peter DeSouza-Feighoney a kid who may not have said a lot of things in his own voice, but matched the intensity of Ineson's voice work, and played possession really well at his young age. Really sold to me that he was in this state.-Essoe was good as the mom for the time she is in. I think she needs a little more work on the crying and playing distraught, but otherwise had the role down pat for me.-Zovatto did great for me. He's got the vulnerability and strength of a believable character, with mannerisms and expressions that did well to convey his character's journey through this ordeal. I absolutely loved his chemistry with Crowe, and the fact that someone so creepy, came off so amazing.-Crowe though is the winner for me with Ineson. He plays this role so well, a combination of comedy, strength and vulnerability that I absolutely loved in the blend. He's got delivery, he's got timing, and he brings out some very good emotional game without going too far. So good at what he accomplished in this movie amongst the rest of the crewThe Thriller Aspect
-The movie isn't so much a horror, but rather a thriller for me.-The Jump scares are there, but it really has more an occult vibe with our heroes trying to stop this entity and I really liked the approach this movie took.-It's creepy, though not as scary, but the theatrics paint this monster picture that is super enjoyable to watch.-I loved the pacing with it, the goals, the gradual expansion of the story, and the climactic ending that really feels like a war story from the Exorcism, with just enough horror elements to give it some edge rather than being an action thriller.The Mystery
-Another great facet to the movie is learning the source of this possession and what all lies within it.-The Pope's Exorcist does so well with layering the story, giving qualities to the event and adding layers that most Horror movies fail to do.-It's paced nicely to carry throughout the movie, never taking too much from the thrills, but yet never feeling like it's distraction.-Building the antagonist, learning about the ordeals leading to it, and even adding some chinks into the protagonist armor, all worked to build this movie up, and kept me intrigued to figure out what guesses of mine were accurate.The Comedy
-I know, a comedy in a horror movie is a hard act to merge.-Yet, this film did it, using it at just the right moments to relieve the tension, and again never going too hard.-It's a natural character quality to Crowe most of the time, his words and jokes a part of his tricks.-Other times, the timing and delivery are so great, that I just laughed at the placing, appreciating that balance the writers did.The Story/Character Development
-And surprisingly, this movie is indeed about the story elements and really bringing something to this movie to make it stand out.-Crowe and the demon have a lot more levels than I expected, and they play so well together as their pasts come to light. It's believable, relevant, and quite a great dance of strong wills that I enjoyed seeing this.-Then you have the other priest who too has his own demons to face and it works to help further the plot and the story, expanding past the typical roles.-There are subplots that melt into it as well, and this battle that the church is facing gets its fair representation without stealing the show, so it really does work for me in a narrative based movie.DISLIKES:The Predictability
-It is an exorcist movie, and unfortunately there is a lot of things you know are coming that you've seen before.-The way the bouts occur, the usual tricks that they do, the nature of the story, it's all in the usual deck of cards these movies do.-Doesn't mean it's awful, but... if you are looking for that unique spin, you most likely won't find much in this film, which is more a warning than anything else.Crossed One of My Lines
-The over use of the F word is not my line, but for space sakes, the F word gets a tad overused in this film to the point of blatant use and boredom. Given it's the second movie to do this, can't say that it helped things either.-No, the other line that crossed had to do with animals, and though CGI, there is an unnecessary need for this display when there were so many other things we could have done.-This won't be issues for most other viewers, but it's another warning and a reflection of again, animal use for the sake of just being torturing.Some Story Lines Needed More Work
-The movie is trying to juggle a lot of characters, and while they mostly work, their plots may have been lost to something else.-For me there are two storylines that potentially needed some smoothing out, one slightly, the other majorly.-One goes towards the opening scenes and this battle with clergy and Crowe. It's got a rather build up moment, and then sort of fizzles out, only saved by the ending and a few fleeting scenes.-The other has to do with the mom, daughter, and son. There is trauma, hurt, and a lot of other things to explore, but we get the bare minimum use of these characters and I think another ten to fifteen minutes would have done well to give them more use.The Power Scaling At The End
-The movie is all about building up the power and seeing these legendary figures fight. It's tough, the climb is a struggle and the realism is playing well as each dive into the mystery is revealed.-But then the ending happens. Now we get anime levels of fighting that start to feel like somehow people not quite equipped become super equipped.-The power scaling works with the theatrics, but after such careful and logical build up, this sudden miraculous birth of strength may be symbolic and metaphorical, but feels out of place given the pacing.The VERDICT:
The Pope's Exorcist may not be timed well or the scariest movie of the year, but what it does achieve is a story driven horror, where the characters, narrative, and setting do the best job of making an engaging film. There is a lot more balance than I thought, and for those of religious faith, it really serves a great merit to the levels they dove into this man's books and his struggles. With great acting, some good chemistry, and time dedication to making the world come to life, this thriller more than hits levels to make it worth the investment, with I believe the theater helping enhance a bit. Sadly, the movie will not hit the scare factor for most I believe, nor does it shine on the unique flavor you might be looking for. Story lines need some smoothing out alongside keeping the realism, but outside of that, there isn't going to be much that I can really bash this movie for, nor do I want to. With this in mind the movie overall in my score book is:Horror/Thriller: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

While a bit cringy he was relatable and cute. The others apart from the other priest at the place were only there to exist and didn't provide any depth or whatsoever.Speaking of the depth. The movie was so on the surface on the time. Not even trying to be slightly original from the ""yet another type of a exorcist movie"". But that is ok. If you don't take the movie seriously and watch it as an American popcorn movie that is. It is ok.It's a perfect movie to watch at home like me, when u are sick. So happy I didn't give money for that. I'm sorry for the people that had to give money in the cinema.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","neil-476","17 April 2023","Father Gabriel Amorth, the Pope's Exorcist, has Cardinal Sullivan out for his blood when the Pope sends him to Spain to investigate a worring case of an American woman who, with her teenage sone and daughter, has moved into an old Abbey with past history dating back to the Inquisition. The son appears to have contracted a demon quite quickly.Amorth was a real person and this film purports to be based on reality. Without voicing an opinion on the man or his work, I personally suspect that this film consists entirely of made-up stuff to entertain a cinema audience. And it's entertaing. In the middle of all the usual supernatural shenanigans (because there's nothing going on here which you haven't seen before), Russell Crowe is having great fun as the clergyman who travels from Rome to Seville on a motor scooter, his exorcise kit strapped to the back (no crash helmet, he doesn't need one, you see), taking his ""It's a-da spicy meatballs"" accent with him.It's fun, and I'm sure it was meant to be. I'm not sure it ought to be, but that's another matter!I wasn't over-impressed with the lad who played the infected son. Also, I thought he was a girl for the longest time.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","jboothmillard","27 April 2023","I'd seen the trailer for this scary movie a couple of times, I saw it in a way as a warm-up from the release of the new Exorcist sequel in a few months (it's called The Exorcist), the leading actor made it appealing to me as well, directed by Julius Avery (Son of a Gun, Overlord). Basically, set in 1986, Father Gabriel Amorth (Razzie nominated Russell Crowe) is an Italian Catholic priest, an earthy, scooter-riding, humorous, practical man, and the Vatican's leading exorcist; he is the personal exorcist of the Pope (Razzie nominated Franco Nero). He is visiting an Italian village where a man is seemingly possessed by a demon. The man is tied up in his bedroom, Amorth and the local priest enter the room to perform an exorcism. During the process, using a Saint Benedict Medal sacramental, Amorth drives the demon into a pig, which is then killed with a shotgun. This incident gets Amorth in trouble with a Church tribunal, as he acted without permission from his superiors. The tribunal members include friendly African Bishop Lumumba (Cornell John) who respects Amorth, and vicious American Cardinal Sullivan (Ryan O'Grady) who is sceptical of demonic possession. Amorth tells his superiors that evil does exist, and that he did not perform a true exorcism, but rather, some psychological theatre to help the mentally disturbed man. Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal. In Spain, single mother Julia (Alex Essoe) has travelled from America to a mysterious old Spanish abbey which was Henry's father's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident. She moves into the abbey with her rebellious teenage Amy (Laurel Marsden) and her young son Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) who was in the car accident that killed his father Roberto (Santi Bay√≥n), he is still traumatised and has not spoken a word since it happened. The abbey is being restored by workman and Julia intends to sell it, but they are forced to leave when a sinister fire occurs. Slowly, Henry starts behaving bizarrely, speaking vulgar words in a demonic voice (Ralph Ineson). He is given serum chemistry treatment and an MRI scan, but the results show nothing abnormal. Henry, diabolically possessed, requests a priest. The local Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto) arrives, but Henry obscenely expresses contempt for him. The Pope assigns Father Amorth to visit the possessed boy in Spain. Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as his assistant, although Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist. Esquibel says he has heard of Amorth but not read his books. Amorth advocates the importance of prayer, though Esquibel makes mistakes during their exorcisms, including strangling Henry when the demon antagonises him, mocking him for his sins. The duo is unsuccessful exorcising Henry, as he utters blasphemous phrases during the rite. The demon even possesses Amy at times. Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood, but he convinces her to pray after she reveals she believed her guardian angel helped her in childhood. In Rome, the Pope becomes ill while reading documents about the Spanish case and goes to hospital. Amorth finds a well on the grounds of the abbey, beneath it is a complex sealed off chamber. He learns that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition, an exorcist, was possessed by a dangerous demon. The Church covered this up and placed him inside a cage inside this chamber. Exploring the chamber, Amorth also discovers the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism. Amorth and Esquibel participate in the sacrament of Confession and Absolution, mutually confessing their sins. Amorth was an Italian partisan, he survived World War II and vowed to serve God in gratitude, but he did not save a mentally ill woman who asked him for help due to his pride, she committed suicide and he has felt guilty since. Esquibel fornicated with a young woman he did not later marry. The two absolve each other for their sins and ready themselves to exorcise Henry. Amorth instructs Esquibel to wear a Miraculous Medal necklace. During the exorcism, they have horrible visions of the women whom they failed. The exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, following Asmodeus previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth. Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon does not allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church. However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon. Amorth is freed from the demon, as is Henry, and the Pope recovers in hospital. The triumphant Amorth and Esquibel visit Rome, finding Sullivan has taken leave in Guam, being replaced by Lumumba. Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive. Lumumba tells them they will be visiting hundreds of other sites suspected to have evil spirits, with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to fight against the Devil. Amorth jokingly says, ""We're going to Hell!"" The film ends with details about the real Amorth's career including his writing many books. Also starring Bianca Bardoe as Rosaria, Paloma Bloyd as Interpreter, Alessandro Gruttadauria as Father Gianni, River Hawkins as Enzo / Halphas, Jordi Collet as Carlos, Edward Harper-Jones as Young Amorth, and Matthew Sim as Cardinal Abato. Crowe with his up and down Italian accent does give a good performance as the experienced priest unafraid to go against satanic forces and with a sense of humour. It is fair to say it has similarities to the 1973 Exorcist (especially towards the end), there is not much original stuff, but the child possessed by evil and demonic battle sequences do get your attention, and the lead character is likeable, as an overall film it's a standard-issue just about reasonable supernatural horror. Okay!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","pinballwizard-83712","7 May 2023","Julius Avery's intriguing and gripping well-crafted horror film that truly delivers an entertaining scary good time. About the Chief Vatican Exorcist Father Gabrieie Amorth, marvelously played by Russell Crowe who delivers a brilliant nuanced star performance with some wisecracking humor that makes his portrayal so endearing, Father Amorth is ordered by the Pope, superbly played by Franco Nero, to Spain to a remote old abbey that has been inherited by an American mother Julia, teenage daughter Amy, terrifically played Alex Essoe and Laurel Marsden, and young son Henry, impressively played by Peter De Souza-Feighoney, who has been possessed by a powerful hateful demon that means to use the boy as bait to destroy Father Amorth. A young local Spanish Priest named Father Esquibel, wonderfully played by Daniel Zovatto, who has no idea on how to deal with possession will assist Father Amorth in battling this dark vengeful entity, and they make a great team together. Solid direction by Avery, who gives his film excellent and chilling scenes of horror with impressive visual effects. Beautiful cinematography by Khalid Mohtaseb, with an effective creepy score by Jed Kurzel. This surprise box office hit was way better than I thought it was going to be, and Crowe's committed performance is what makes this horror thriller work so well.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","alvdora-32334","4 May 2023","This movie was the best exorcist movie I've seen so far. It's creepy, shocking, and more complex than the other ones out there. I watched it twice in a row, and the 2nd time I realized that there was more to the story than I had originally thought. Example: the young man getting irate at the meeting with Gabe, the demon saying he's infiltrated the church, they make it seem he's going to use Gabe but then when Gabe begins to fight the demon from within himself that same young man falls to his knees in agony in the church and has to go on a sabbatical. Which implies that he had already began to influence the church by using him to denounce the exorcist. And saying that an exorcist is no longer needed within the church. Like I said the movie is more than just fear inducing. It's also thought inducing. Which is something we are beginning to see in a lot of newer horror movies. I love a good scary movie that's not all college girls with big boobs screaming and running up the stairs like idiots. Definitely recommend this movie. Very much worth the $19.99 I spent on renting it.","

Seen oh so many times, chewed upon, yet with the same silly approach, ancient beliefs, tricks, insanities that no one of this generation feels like swallowing any more. It's quite shocking in fact to what a poor scenario Russell Crowe signed up. He acted like he can't be bothered, the others couldn't even deliver that much. At points I was wondering if it was meant to be a parody or a horroresque.If it wasn't for the good special effects, this would have been a one-star-don't-waste-your-time movie, but I graciously gave it two.

It's a bit scary at times, but not too much. The story is ok but could have been better. This movie reminds me a bit of The Ninth Gate.If you like this kinda stuff, I recommend also checking out The Gift (2000) with Kate Blanchett, Frailty (2001), What Lies Beneath (2000), Dragonfly (2002), and if you are in for a really strong drink based on a true story: The Conjuring (2013). There are also good older movies to check out, such as Angel Heart (1987) with Robert De Niro and Mickey Rourke.In literature there is also the splendid, short book by Bill Wiese, ""23 Minutes in Hell"" which the author claims is also a true story.","

He plays a tortured soul who should have saved a young woman, but did not.

Is the only one in that priest's books?I understand that they tried to bring a different kind of prist, that had a different look to the situations, but the mix of little jokes and a such a superficial characters and situations just made it a bad movie.They actually had the nerve to absolve the catolic church form the horrors of the inquisition. It was a ""demon"" that possessed the church, guys, not the persons that killed other people because o their on volition.And, with no surprise, the demons that the priests face in the final battle had the shape of women.

Russell Crowe was really good as Father Amorth and I absolutely loved the fictionalised story line about the Spanish Inquisition. All the supporting cast were really good as well.My only criticism of the film is that I think some of the demon's dialogue was a bit corny. The whole calling him Gabe and a few other things made me cringe, but I was able to overlook it due to the quality of the film. Definitely a great exorcism film. No its not The Exorcist - nothing will ever compare to that film. However, The Pope's Exorcist would have to be one of the better possession films of the last ten years.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","darkreignn","16 April 2023","If you thought the Pope's job was tough, wait till you see what his exorcist has to deal with! If you thought that was a corny introductory sentence for this review, well, you're right - it was, however, my intention to kick things off as closely as possible to the way ""The Pope's Exorcist"" starts, as the movie itself begins in a similarly cheesy manner. Don't let my intro, or the film's for that matter, fool you, because this movie sets its intentions from the very beginning; ""The Pope's Exorcist"" is everything you've already seen done before from an exorcism movie, but perhaps never this self-aware and entertaining.Honestly, I loved this movie, and I was dreading walking into the theatre if nothing else because of the absolutely awful exorcism themed movies that were released in recent memory (""Prey for the Devil"" and ""The Unholy"" come to mind). I wanted to go and see one movie today (April 15, 2023), and I chose this over ""Renfield"" simply for the fact that Russel Crowe was playing Father Gabriel Amorth. Not even being a huge Russel Crowe fan, I know that he always gives 110% of himself in every single role (I mean, have you seen ""Unhinged?), and since I had enough Cinemark credits for a free ticket, I figured I'd give this a chance - and I'm so glad I did because I was so, so entertained by ""The Pope's Exorcist.""Listen, you're going to get exactly what you expect when walking into this movie: Someone projectile vomiting blood? Check. The possessed person spewing profanities and over-the-top sexual remarks? You better believe it. Someone contorting their body to crab-walk across the ceiling? Oh, heck yeah, that's in here! However, where past exorcism horror films have taken themselves way too seriously, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" has an air of self-awareness to it that led to a great sense of fun throughout, thanks in part to Russel Crowe's energetic performance.Crowe looks like he's having the time of his life here, playing a quick-witted, whiskey loving priest, and his energy radiates off the screen - I mean, I can't remember ever seeing a priest have this much personality in an exorcism film before, and it's so entertaining to watch Crowe in this role. And the movie as a whole has a really campy vibe to it overall, which I certainly didn't anticipate, but it was a welcome change of pace when compared to today's recent dark, dreary, and overly serious horror films. However, this movie is a horror film, and so we must talk about that.Honestly, I didn't find this movie scary at all, but the elderly woman sitting next to me was literally jumping at everything and covering her eyes every time something ""scary"" happened, so that right there tells you that some people will, and apparently are, finding this movie scary. And while I can only imagine that those who are scared by this movie have most likely never seen a horror film before in their lives, I have to say that, for me personally, the lack of scares didn't bother me because of how much entertainment value the film had. The exorcism sequences were a lot of fun, even if they were filled with the usual cliches. Director Julius Avery helmed the film, and I honestly think his direction elevated things past the typical exorcist fare - he has a really great sense of visual style to his movies (i.e., ""Overlord""), and so ""The Pope's Exorcist"" had a lot of cool sights to behold in terms of visuals. Sure, there's some CGI, but it honestly didn't bother me as the film played its exorcism sequences less to be scary and more to be thrilling; this is more of a thriller than a horror film, in my opinion, and I was thrilled - the climax especially had enough sights and sounds that even Helen Keller would find herself caught up in it all.""The Pope's Exorcist"" is, simply put, a ton of fun. I walked into the theatre expecting to hate this, and I walked out in love with it because of how entertained I was. Sure, it's nothing too innovative, but Russel Crowe's dedicated, infectious performance drew me in more than I thought possible, and the film has just enough supernatural escapades (wait until you see the pig) that even the most jaded horror fans will certainly find something to be entertained by.","

He must save the boy from the demon or they will lose their souls forever.Overall, I thought the entertainment value, story, and acting is good. Russell Crowe does a great job as acting in his role in a priest performing exorcisms. Shoutouts to the production crew that made the film more dark and demonic.

"The Pope's Exorcist","rogier-86785","29 October 2023","As horror goes, The Pope's Exorcist is more on the action-packed and classic side, with a possession story that combines elements of grief, mysterious objects, haunted house, history, deception and jump scares. It is well executed and played, and feels like a good, solid horror story with great action energy. As such it deserves a higher rating here than it gets.Although frightening, the film will definitely not be the scariest horror you'll ever see. It relies on well-known horror tropes, which allows it to quickly get to the point of exorcising and drive the story forwards, sometimes more akin to an action-thriller.This reliance on established cues however, also means it can mix new elements in it. The contentious relationship of main protagonist priest Gabriele Amorth (Crow's character) with the church being the absolute highlight for me. The dialogue in these scenes is often better than the horror elements all together. And a nice hidden sense of humor about faith tops it off well.Amorth as a character is also highly lovable (what's in a name), and Crow's depiction of him is another highlight for the actor. Which is saying something... because in real life Amorth was quite controversial. However, this is more of a fantastical historical demon story, that seems to just use a name to make a good movie, and in no way seems historically accurate. There seems to even be a mild setup for future story, so maybe we'll see more.All in all, don't let the lower ratings from reviewers fool you. Horror always gets a bad rap from them. This is a well-executed and entertaining exorcism story with a focus on action, twists and turns and some deeper historical thoughts. In other words, you'll have a good time.","

With all the money that they have to spend and the years of watching the original, these pathetic fools till cannot come up with better script. The directors are equally bum skulled and have no clue how to tell a story. The whole thing about this movie is vile, pathetic and unbelievable. The cast are all wrong. The possessed boy looks like a whimpy girl whose acting ability is worse than my parrot mimicking my dog's barking. Awful to the max. The script is poor written. Russell Crow must be super desperate and needed money badly to be in such horrid movie. His acting is so pretentious and awful that I thought he needs to go back to acting school all over again.I am so glad i watched it for free, otherwise I would have sued everyone in the film.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","sashairk","11 May 2023","While I'm not a big fan of horror movies, Russell Crowe was brilliant here in the role of an exorcising monk, Father Gabriel Amorth. It was a real pleasure to watch him acting in that role, a great difference from his usual characters that he used to play.Unlike the 'classic' Exorcist movie this movie has the message that the Gates of Hell were actually opened by the Inquisition with its multiple tortures and murders. So it was sort of 'mea culpa' for that dark period of the Catholic Church.Therefore, this film should not be viewed as a regular scary flick whose only purpose is just to entertain the viewers by watching just another scary stuff. I definitely recommend it even to those who usually stay away from this kind of genre.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","mbnn","2 May 2023","It has been a while since I actually enjoyed a film like this and let me tell you, this one is actually pretty good.Russel Crowe once again does an amazing amount of great acting and the character he portrays is absolutely interesting.The movie has a lot of the horror elements but instead of adding a lot of jumpscares it puts focus on story, character building and emotions. Which I actually like a lot.From the beginning till the end this movie keeps going strong and keeps you in it's story. I really hope the creators will make a 2nd movie as it definitely would be great to see how the story continues.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","BlueBird84","24 July 2023","It commits the worst sin a horror movie can commit. It is bad without being funny-bad. And it's boring to boot. The possessed children are laughable (but not actually, because you must remember this movie isn't funny). Father Amorth is a baffling character, hailed as the best exorcist around but strangely blase about his faith and his profession, seeming to take neither very seriously. Very few attempts at scares. The movie takes a couple stabs at being shocking and consistently fails. Both priests seem to have a combined IQ of 70. All characters are paper-thin and poorly developed. If I wasn't on a plane I would have stopped this halfway through.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","sanjubhat","3 August 2023","Film Review: The Pope's Exorcist streaming on NetflixBased on true incidents of exorcism conducted by Father Gabreille Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist , this film focuses on one incident in 1987 where Father Amorth and Father Tomas perform an exorcism to rid a young innocent boy of a powerful demon who has bigger plans which involve the Vatican and beyond !! In doing so, the 2 protagonists have to battle their own personal demons & so does the Vatican... Will our protagonists emerge as victors!!Russell Crowe as father Amorth, the whiskey drinking protagonist with a quirky sense of humour has an imposing screen presence and carries the film on his strong shoulders all throughout. Daniel Zovatto as Father Tomas ably supports Crowe in his fight against evil.The film is set in a remote Abbey in Spain, the ambience is dull, gloomy and sets the perfect precedance for a great horror film !! Not the scariest film ever, it however has a few decent jumpscare moment's. I would call it more of an adventure horror movie rather than a hardcore horror film. A bit of a dampner for hardcore horror film buffs!!Plans are in place to create a franchise and a sequel has already been announced !! Would love to see more paranormal adventures of Father Amorth & Tomas in future !!Going with 3/5 for this one ...

"The Pope's Exorcist","bbosma-24403","3 November 2023","As a movie, this isn't bad. Well put together, reasonable script, some good moments. What makes it worth watching is Russell Crowe. He hasn't been in many great things lately, but man ... he can act. He makes the character of Father Gabrielle Amorth - the Pope's Exorcist - interesting, amusing, likeable but most of all believable. That's important, since Father Amorth was a real person and he actually was the Vatican's chief exorcist. While Father Amorth is an intelligent man who recognises that 98% of the cases he is called to attend are actually not possession but mental health issues, on this occasion he confronts the real deal - and it's him the demon actually wants. Not for everyone, but as I said, worth watching just to see Russel Crowe making it obvious that he is still one of the best actors around.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","fnfighter","14 May 2023","If I had to choose between this or the new Evil Dead I would pick Evil Dead. This movie wasn't bad. But honestly, it wasn't the greatest. It's just too slow in my opinion. But the plot being so sinister did make it a bit more scary and I'm definitely glad I watched it. But if I had to choose between this or the New Evil Dead. The new Evil Dead was more satisfying to our family. Edge of the seat type of scary. So if you are broke like me and don't want to spend that hard earned money, go with what I said. Unless you are completely new to demon type movies then I could be wrong. But we've seen so many it's meh.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Ali-Hasnain","9 May 2023","I recently watched a horror movie for the first time, as I used to believe that horror movies were a waste of time since it seemed illogical to purposely induce fear in oneself under normal circumstances. However, due to Russell Crowe's involvement in the movie, I decided to give it a chance. Overall, the movie was quite enjoyable and managed to hold my attention throughout. However, I was disappointed with the director's choice for the ending, as the supposedly fearless and stubborn demon was easily defeated with just a prayer. I feel that the ending could have been improved. Nevertheless, I must commend Russell Crowe for his brilliant acting performance. I would rate the movie 7 out of 10.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","teacheranarivera","7 May 2023","Even though the movie is some kind of slow, we need to remember that the important thing here is that is a non-fiction story base on a true character. I do like it. I like the performance of Russell Crowe and the way they connect the story of the crusades with the demon explanation. For me was very well development and if the story was exactly like they shows in the movie, was really creepy. The only thing that I found not too good was the thing that the movie take 2 hrs and for me that's too long. Other than that, the other performance of the other characters was good. Specially the little boy who the demon posses.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","zzorn88","1 June 2023","It's been a while since we've seen an exorcist style movie come off the main stream of Hollywood. I will say that it is great to see Russell Crowe back in action after having a rocky career. I can really tell that he got into his role as the popes right hand exorcist man .. It's the fake Italian accent and especially seeing him ride in on a scooter that did it for me LOL.The plot line felt decent but it did have one twist too many. It was interesting to see the dynamic share between Crow and forces of darkness being that there's a score to settle. The child actor who is possessed by the ""demon"" did an excellent job at his role. Although the CGI effects were effective I did feel a sense of cheesiness about the make up and other actors participating this film.Overall I give us movie at 6.66 out of 10 seeing as how we are talking about evil trying to take over the world. I also give Russell Crowe a solid 8/10 for his over acting, enthusiastic character building, and mini scooter riding. I can't wait to see if they're going to make a sequel as that's how they set up the ending. Definitely worth a watch if you're into horror movies or exorcism films.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","jayboyjay","6 April 2023","I'll keep this brief. It's nothing you haven't seen before, however Russel Crowe does bring a certain gravitas to his character. Some.of the themes of belief and the power of unwaivering faith are briefly touched upon but the usual cgi fare, bombastic set pieces and the ""true story"" tropes are all here for everyone to see. Imagine Constantine meets the exorcist with a big of see no evil (Eric Bana) and your kinda in the ball park. Not a horror classic, not even an exorcism classic but Crowe does do well in his role and his accent is way better than Thor love and thunder. Passable popcorn flick. 5/10.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","highwingremnants","6 May 2023","It lifts the majority of its details straight from The Exorcist. Old experienced exorcist teams with younger priest with zero exorcism experience? The child's case has been dismissed by medical authorities as psychological trauma? The child is tied to bed for everyone's safety? The young priest loses temper and attacks child after demon reads his mind and plays on his weak points? A teenage girl's body distorts into the spider-walk? The implausibly copious vomiting of liquid straight into a clergyman's face? The demon referring to people as pigs? The possessed child's face being a mass of lacerations and their belly showing word messages like an information board? The demon is ultimately defeated via priest inviting the demon to take him instead? They're all here!Everything it bolts on that wasn't in The Exorcist is terrible 2000s horror rubbish: stretchy face CGI, jarringly prominent and numerous licensed songs, videogame fiery sigils, 2D characters with seemingly no internal substance or intelligence. Hmm, a huge stone seal bearing the symbol of the Vatican. I'll attach that to my vespa and haul that straight off. What's this now: another stone door marked by the Inquisition? Smash it down. A famous exorcist voluntarily locked himself in a cage and swallowed the key to protect an ominous iron door? Let's get into his guts and unlock that immediately. And no, that doesn't mean it's good-bad. I love enjoyably terrible films. This is not one.Even the demon is weak. It's meant to be Hell's baddest, but its most solid burn is to repeatedly call the exorcist ""Gabe"" instead of ""Gabriel"". There's no imagination here to make you buy the idea that there's a dangerous evil inside the kid rather than a slightly annoying goblin.I will admit that it's nicely shot, but that's about it. Okay, The Exorcist is an enduring classic and perhaps it's unreasonable to expect another film to reach that height, but couldn't it at least try? It fails to be even a tenth as good as a 50-year-old film.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","ma-cortes","29 October 2023","An acceptably watchable exorcism thriller but with some failures , gaps and flaws. Based on Fr. Gabriel Amorth's life, a known exorcist priest who made over 150 exorcisms. For 2,000 years the Vatican has recorded evidence of evil . May God have mercy on their souls. Following Gabriele Amorth (Russell Crowe), the Vatican's leading exorcist, as he's called by the Pope (Franco Nero) upon to exorcise the demon, as he investigates the possession of a child, Henry (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) living in Spain, suffering from the effects of being possessed by the devil and uncovers a conspiracy the Vatican has tried to keep secret. Henry, satanically possessed, asks for a priest; the local Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto) arrives, but Henry abuses him and says, ""Wrong priest. The possession proves to be an ancient satanic force more powerful than ever imagined. There is something dark and sinister inside Henry, a nasty demon that goes bersek and the exorcist wants to eject it. The child begins to have a devastating effect on anyone close, causing serious injury and death. He getting sicker by the time, being really possessed, so a demon into a kid gone amok. As Gabriele attempts to help the possessed child and submitting him weird exorcisms .There are some things best kept in secret !.The Pope's Exorcist (2023) is a creepy and horror film about exorcism, professionally, though flawed, directed by Julius Avery. Truly terrifiyng story following the ultimate battle between good and evil - God versus Satan √≥ Asmodeus. Horror picture shot in fits and starts with incoherent, predictible and well-known plot, dealing with a ghastly possession, as a kid is possessed by a malevolent and heinous spirit causing creepy, scary and terrible moments ; then , a Vatican exorcist and a young priest must do battle with an ancient satanic force to save the soul of the strange child. A rare and scary film about exorcism in similar style to classic The Exorcist 1973 by William Friedkin. Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth, Chief Exorcist of the Vatican, The Pope's Exorcist follows Amorth as he investigates a young boy's terrifying possession and ends up uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden. William Friedkin's The Exorcist's movie remains still startling and engrossing with every viewing, it spread countless sequels and imitations, one of them is this one, though , of course, it is far cry from the original. Genuinely scary moments overcome some obvious plot devices. This is a juicy terrifying material fashioning an iconic diabolic possession, providing screams, thrills, shocks and chilling scenes .It has an extremely known premise spawns the film in ups and downs. The Pope well played by Franco Nero makes references to the Fallen Angels, these come from the 'Book of Enoch', an ancient Hebrew apocalyptic religious text, attributed by tradition to Enoch, Noah's great-grandfather. The Book of Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons. 200 angels, who were called The Watchers, lusted after human women and came down to earth on Mount Hermon in the days of Jared (Noah's father). These fallen angels cohabited with human women and produced giants of human-angel hybrid called the Nephilim, and about why some angels fell from heaven, as well as an explanation of why the flood, as narrated in Genesis, would have been morally necessary, and a prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah. All semblance of plausibility is extracted, leaving a main and support cast of decent actors : Russell Crowe who had accompanied Amorth in order to better know the role he was playing, Daniel Zovatto, Alexandra Essoe, Laurel Marsden, Cornell John, while screaming, fleeing and be afraid of the strange possessions, poltergeisters and phenomena.It delivers a scary and eerie ambient thanks to expert cameraman Khalid Mohtaseb. As well as a frightening, suspenseful and chilling musical score by Jed Kurzel. Being efficiently produced by Sophie Cassidy, Homewood, Michael Patrick Kaczmarek, Jeff Katz, including abundant FX of possession and other visual effects in computer generator. This non-sense , late night horror picture was passably directed by Julius Avery , though with no originality and it has some flaws and gaps. Julius Avery has directed a few acceptable films such as : Samaritan (2022) with Sylvester Stallone, Overlord (2018) with Iain De Caestecker, Wyatt Russell, Pilou Asb√¶ka and Son of a Gun (2014) with Ewan McGregor and Brenton Thwaites. Rating: 6/10. The picture will appeal to Russell Crowe fans and horror genre enthusiasts.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","dannyboymcny-1","19 August 2023","I didn't exactly understand why there was a panel to ask questions of Father Amorth, not why some young American seemed to be leading the panel while older men with far more experience remained quiet. Given that Amorth was given a mandate to do what he was doing by the Pope they (he) had no actual authority, which Amorth recognized.The idea that the majority of possession cases was small worked for me. Mental illness was misunderstood in the past and so possession seemed to be an answer. Yet the idea that supernatural evil did exist was important.I had no issue with the acting or the possessed children. How were they supposed to sound? They sounded convincing to me. Not scary in the jump scare style often seen but instead in the idea that children children are being victimized and why 'lesser' targets were chosen. Fly under the radar to achieve a greater purpose.There were also doubts that were able to be exorcised by experience, forgiveness and need. That last part seems important and why the final showdown with Asmodeus turned out the way it did.It was the ending that was the chilling part. We knew about past plans for controlling or destroying religions but this was something else entirely. The bishops at the Vatican nearly gave the demons exactly what they needed. Instead, the Vatican gained the tools necessary to take the demons head on. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel because this movie is clearly set up for one.If you're looking for a deep horror, rather than blood, gore, and scare tactics, I think this is the one. The implied scale of what is going on, and what also went on centuries earlier, should be enough to put chills in anyone.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","TxMike","3 October 2023","This is not normally a movie I would seek out but I always find
Russell Crowe's roles interesting, some great. The DVD box says this movie ""was inspired by"" the experiences and writings of Father Gabriel Amorth, a Roman Catholic priest at the Vatican, working directly under the Pope. Most of his career he was the Vatican's exorcist. But he would tell those who inquired, about 98% of the cases referred to him required psychological treatment, only about 2% of the cases did it require exorcism.There are two things going on in this movie. First is Father Amorth in his work as an exorcist and we see an example of that as the movie begins. The other is an American family, mother, rebellious teenage daughter, and non-verbal young son. The husband and dad had died about a year earlier, the wife had inherited a Spanish Abbey that had been in the husband's family for generations. They traveled there to get it suitably fixed up to sell then head back to the States.The abbey had a dark history and soon after they arrived strange things started happening. Then the young son seemed to become possessed. Father Amorth was sent to evaluate it and take care of it. Things get really, really weird.It is important to remember this was ""inspired by"" and not intended to be a faithful telling of the exorcist's experiences. I enjoyed it at some level but overall I don't rate it particularly highly.At home on DVD from my public library.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","xxxxxdarkmoon","23 November 2023","What an overwhelming film experience! I don't see any weaknesses in this movie. The horror is so evil and scary that I found it hard to watch some of the scenes. The antagonist is played by two exorcists and one of them is Russell Crowe. His trust in God is so strong and deep that it takes away all fear, including the fear of the viewer. And that is exactly what makes the film unique. He provokes the demon by showing no fear and making sarcastic jokes. And he explains why he does this: demons hate jokes. Crowe takes away the fear by explaining everything that happens and why the demon does it.Russell Crowe's role as the Pope's exorcist suits him perfectly. I'm not saying this role surpasses his role as Maximus in Gladiator, but it's just as great.We all know that Russell Crowe is one of the most respected actors in the world, and no one would expect him to play a role in a franchise. But this role? I think he would do it. Mark my words.Verdict: Recommended viewing, for anyone who can handle this kind of horror. A fascinating film.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Real_Review","10 June 2023","The Pope sends Russell Crowe on adventures as an exorcist.This is a strange film. I have seen many exorcist-themed horror films, and most are rather 'blah'. This film is not 'blah'. I'm not used to seeing a cliche horror film with a real budget - but, I suppose this isn't a generic, cliche horror film. I remember being surprised that Vera Farmiga was starring in 'The Conjuring' series, but I was shocked that Russell Crowe was making this film. The horror movie model is profitable because there is little up-front investment. However, this film hired a real lead actor, had a real cast with some depth, and was filmed in a few different locations - there was a $20 million investment to create an outstanding horror movie experience.The efforts were successful - this is a good film that will have you on the edge of your seat. The ending suggests that this might be a series (like 'The Conjuring' was created into a thematic series), so long as they can keep Russell Crowe interested. Either way, 'The Pope's Exorcist' (2023) is among the best of the many exorcist-themed horror films.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:Acting: 1/1;Casting: 1/1;Directing: 1/1;Story: 1/1;Writing/Screenplay: 1/1;Total Base Score = 5Modifiers (+ or -):Music Score/Soundtrack: + 0.5 (A horror movie with a real soundtrack.

Same regurgitated tripe. The Rite (Anthony Hopkins) was better ten years ago than this. That was an astounding exorcist movie! Even the sequels to the original Exorcist movies were better. This had no tension, no impact, no stakes. A snooze. Even Crowe's acting couldn't avert this.If they intend on making a franchise out of this, they need to stop repeating themselves over and over and over again. Who gets clearance to make these endlessly repeating stories? Is this for the benefit of Gen Z which has no prior knowledge of superior films and therefore deems something like this acceptable?","

I almost felt bad that a great legend like Franco Nero accepted to play in this movie - it was the only good performance of the cast. Unfortunately, not even him could save such a bad script. The special effects and sound were more suitable for a cheap roller coaster adventure than for a film with a religious and spiritual bent.

In Spain there is this Castel which is being renovated and Russel Crow is sent to investigate. Crow has humor, and understanding which creates a likeable character. The supporting actors creates interesting story development. Second half of The Pope's Exorcist becomes a mystery which turns into Raiders of the Lost Arch with history archeological find, fire balls, with a mix of the original exorcist. The end ties up with a new Vatican confronting the Devil trying to hide inside the church itself and the use of evil distraction.

That did spoil it ever so slightly for me, it not having put a foot wrong to that point.This is the best horror film I've seen since the days of the original Omen trilogy.Such a joy to see a horror film with a decent budget and some intelligence.People have lazily compared it to The Exorcist because of the subject matter, but I feel it has much more in common with the aformentioned Omen films. It has that large scale, somewhat epic feel, plus great cinematography and production values. Oh, and the house itself is fantastic.Not to mention the above par acting with a superb performance from Russell Crowe.I hope there's a sequel.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","imseeg","1 January 2024","I had my trepidations watching another horror movie, since I have seen so many average or terrible ones lateley, but fortunately this one is a solidly made excorsist story with a lot of goodies and one lesser feature...The bad; let's start with what I found to be the least exciting feature and that was the use of special effects that were a bit underwhelming, AND they started using these special effects too soon into the story. Why too soon? Because what's most enoyable about this movie is...The good: solid slow buid up in suspense from start till finish, only let down by some silly over use of special effects, when it didnt need any. Why not? Because it's the CHARACTERS that are most important to this story and that's the way I like it!Especially Good: Russell Crowe Russell Crowe Russel Crowe. He nails his performance as a wise (and WITTY) excorsist priest. He truly is THE core of this movie. Terrific acting performance!NOT horryfiying, but suspenseful YES. NOT original, but enjoyable YES.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","PedroPires90","12 April 2023","Generic and full of genre clich√©s, the movie tries to be different by not taking itself too seriously. Sometimes it works, thanks to a badass Russell Crowe in the lead role, driving a scooter and drinking whiskey while he's exorcising demons. However, at times it goes overboard, with many elements that seem straight out of a Marvel movie, including some misplaced humor or underveloped characters.I liked the demon's visual, but I didn't like the acting of the assisting priest. However, the biggest flaw is that the story is boring, there's not much to hold our attention and the horror elements simply don't work, as it's never tense enough. Nice ""final battle"" though.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","JoshuaMercott","2 July 2023","My Impressions:When the Vatican's own leading exorcist found one of his 'cases' more challenging than most, serious demonic activity would, as expected, be unleashed.This movie was adapted from the real-life (as far as we know) experiences of Father Gabriele Amorth who served the Church from 1986 to 2016, in which year he died. Russell Crowe expertly portrayed him in ""The Pope's Exorcist"".Crowe soon became one of the main reasons I sat through the movie. His acting was empathic, engaging, funny, and powerful. Those portions of his performance in authentic Italian were amazing to watch.His character Gabriele's investigation into a possessed child, Henry Vasquez, led to scary sequences which evoked the performance of Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"" of 1973. But, alas, this one didn't meet that gold standard.The young boy (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) did notable work in the role, though. His character's sister and mother, Amy (Laurel Marsden) and Julia (Alex Essoe) Vasquez, respectively, gave great performances.Locations included Italy and Spain in the 80s, which added to the story's appeal. The attention to 80s-era detailing was nostalgic and impressive.The Vasquez family inherited San Sebastian Abbey (in Castile, Spain), which they wanted to restore in the hopes of earning an income by selling it later. Everything about the edifice - including the catacomb and cave (props and otherwise) beneath it - was an architectural delight.I liked how they introduced the possibility of a centuries-old conspiracy connected to the Spanish Inquisition and noted that it was later covered up by the Vatican. At the center of the plot was the 'king of hell' Asmodeus, considered to be one of the most dangerous of all demons, and a Fallen Angel besides.Next, the bold and open take on an exorcist's duties and their purpose, as evidenced by Gabriele Amorth in this movie, was as refreshing as it was riveting to see. Even though they relied a little too much on clich√© to communicate his work ethic, the story didn't suffer for it.""The Pope's Exorcist"" narrowly avoided pandering to religious Catholic sentiments. It also took into account real-world relevance. It made sure to address sexual abuse and psychological instability.Even the demon in question was a character in its own right and had its own motivation - to possess Father Gabriele Amorth, the titular Pope's exorcist, infiltrate the Church at the highest levels, and establish a deceptive direction in it.The concept of 2% of exorcism cases being inexplicable (to Science) and potentially 'evil' contained a good amount of credibility. By the time they revealed the exact identity of the demon (Asmodeus) that was dual-possessing Henry and Amy, all the dots that had accumulated so far in the plot had been diligently connected.Father Gabriele's negligence, pride, and past cowardice on the battlefield (when he served as a soldier in WWII) was a full-bodied human addition to the movie. Those haunting sequences, coupled with Russell Crowe's acting excellence, made ""The Pope's Exorcist"" fascinating to watch.The deceptive nature of demons and how they can potentially do evil in the name of god was a meaningful inclusion. It catered to Catholic sentiments, yes, but it was well within their spiritual context and culture. The notion even makes sense outside the Catholic framework.Given the dark nature of human souls, the idea of a demonic entity manipulating our weaknesses and 'sins' to serve its own agenda, including and especially infiltration and corruption, was not altogether impossible to believe. Great empires fall from within, after all. Planting this 'seed of doubt' in the viewer was, by itself, a stunning accomplishment in ""The Pope's Exorcist"".I did not think they would go so far as to actually let Asmodeus possess Gabriele, but they did. The finale was made doubly empowering because of that creative decision. Russell Crowe's all-too-human performance was praiseworthy and compelling.For the first time since I can remember, I saw Catholic priests in a movie owning their personal sins and shortcomings, using their faith to fight their inner demons - in this case, literally - and performing quite the shepherd's sacrifice to keep their flock safe.Good Lord, I pray there's a sequel. The movie's final scene more than hinted at one.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","daszemplinski","5 May 2023","Really thought this was going to a respectful movie about the work of Father Amorthe. He Seemed to be a good priest and devout Christian. This movie is a joke, Russel Crowe is a caricature of him. This is truly a horror flick along the lines of 80's-90's slasher, Freddy Krueger style. In fact that actually rip off a scene from the 1985 ish movie! Foul, ugly, banal, cliched boring. Had we not bout large beers we would have walked out. Apparently the majority of the budget was blown on Crowe's salary - because every other actor is bottom of the barrel. Fortunately, it was $5 Tuesday - and the large seats are like a bed. Should have taken a nap.","

You Would not think A Movie like this would have HUMOR, but it does Thanks to Russell Crowe. Priest with a Personality !Fair share of Horror and Gore but blended together just right. Best Movie I have seen this Year. Memorable and Hopefully gonna be a Sequel.The Story follows Father Gabrielle Amorth,( Crowe) well known as the Vatican's TOP Exorcist. He Receives his assignments directly from the POPE played with Class by FRANCO NERO.On a particularly harrowing Possession, Amorth enlists the help of Father Esquivel ( Daniel Zovatto) and their Chemistry and Friendship big part of the Film.Loved the Eco Friendly Travel choices by Father Amorth as Well.","

He gives a very strong performance in this movie. This movie is as effective as it because Crowe grounds the story with a very honest performance. The movie delivers a bunch of scary/exciting moments. I wasn't expecting much, mainly because Crowe was in it, but I was really surprised. It's a cracker jack horror movie. It's religious themes are as effective as those in ""The Exorcist"". This movie is not as good as that classic film but it's not far behind.

Of course like many people who saw the trailer would expect a scary, tight, dark movie in which you will be in the edge of your seat and scared to step away from the screen in case you miss something.But what you got was a campy, cgi effects (which don't work), non scary horror film.I must admit I was disappointed after this movie finished, yes I did enjoy it but it was not what I expected.Would I see another movie of the same character, yes I would as I enjoyed Russell Crowe as the main character and could see him playing this one for a few movies like the Insidious & Conjuring movie series.If they do, I hope they make it as a straight horror not the one we had hear.As my headlong says. It was okay, if you have nothing else to watch, see it it's not bad.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","AvionPrince16","11 May 2023","I didnt enjoyed that much the movie but didnt hate it also but it really annoyed me sometimes and how the dialogues lead us to a superstitious thing and how they made theories about the devil, Jesus, the sins. The performance of the main actor is convincing even if im not a fan of that kind of comedy in these horror movies. The mood was there, the ambience too: i enjoyed the blue and orange tone and give an interesting visuals despite the classic plot and characters. So its basically a story about a priest who do his job and we will just get to know him better trough the new case with the old case about a woman who he didnt saved. What else to say? The special effects were good: the boy look convincing and the transformation can be seen much more later in the movie and was well executed. We have also the discussions with the church, the purpose, the religious thought and so on and so on. We have seen a lot of times that kind of topic with the exorcist theme. We have also some history about the house that the family who just moved in. And we know also the name of the devil at the end; it make him more weak; same thing over and over. So to resume that movie: its a classic horror movie with the exorcist theme with some talks who was a little bit too much superstitious for me and some exorcist and some rude language as always the devil is still rude and not really polite so yeah it can still make you know a story about the priest but it made me think that they took too much liberty in my opinion mostly at the end. But it is what is.","

It's not particularly scary, it's not particularly original, the acting is hammy at best. No one has a serviceable character arc in the entire film including the badly written mother.And yet. It is quite fun. In spite of its weird casting choices, hokey script and copycat set pieces (up side down crosses, heads turning, possesions jumping from person to person) it is somewhat fun.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","henry8-3","6 July 2023","Russell Crowe plays Father Gabriele Amorth, exorcist to the Vatican - apparently man and role existed. The Pope himself (Franco Nero) commands Amorth to visit an old abbey in Spain where a young boy is possessed and advises that that the church have had issues there before. It is apparent from day one that the possession is real, but Amoth's investigations suggests there is more to this than meets the eye.Whilst 'The Exorcist' did this first and better and as such a lot of the possession stuff is pretty familiar, there is still a lot of fun to be had here. This is largely because of Crowe, who fills the screen with his performance and the glorious character he's come up with. The effects are impressive, it's intriguing and a little unsettling, if not really scary, but it's at its best when Amorth is in charge and fighting Satan with a smile on his face. A sequel is planned. Good fun.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","josephbrewster-88279","24 May 2023","If you like exorcism flicks or like horror or like Russell Crowe, see it. It's a well done, well acted, middlingly written, nicely filmed trip back a few decades with refreshingly relevant ideas packaged in moderately predictable structures.It's good. Not great, unless you count Crowe's performance, but good, dependable catholic horror, filled with enough action, tension and stuff flying around to void the ""slow burn"" category. It isn't incredibly scary, but doesn't try to have overly pretentious jump scares and sticks with on-screen violence and shock rock demon dialogue (demons say the darndest things).All the tropes are here, but done well. All the cliches are served up properly. Crowe shines on screen, like you'd expect, and the rest of the cast do well enough, although the kid's parts smell a bit stereotyped and overplayed at times. FX are solid, set is cool. What's not to love?This movie won't change the genre or win any awards, but it's good. It deserves a watch, so if you're reading this and you're on the fence, watch it.","

I like the duality of the church belief systems and how it has created its own political duopoly, thus creating a secondary tension between the characters.Even with a powerful performer as Russell Crowe, who knocked his character out of the park, the support characters needed more developing. This in turn, would give the audience cause to be rooting for them as well. A few parts seemed a bit disjointed as if added as an after thought, to support something that didn't need supporting.But all in all it was watchable and they left it open for a sequel... which I would watch.","

I was shocked when I realized I was 50 minutes into the film because the story flowed very well. I thought it was less time and I think it's because the film isn't all over the place all at once. It keeps its focus on telling the story and that made the film very enjoyable. Character introductions and set ups weren't over the top or too long. You knew who they were, what they were doing and where they fit in the film and the cast did an amazing job.

"The Pope's Exorcist","gianmarcoronconi","24 April 2023","OK, horror movie with a very basic plot that plays out a real-life character in a slightly exaggerated way. The film in general entertains a lot and even if it is very exaggerated and very banal it still entertains and manages to keep the spectator glued to the screen and this is always a good quality for a film. Point that I find negative, however, is the sequence of the Pope who is sick towards the end of the film with the parallel of our protagonist who discovers the real reasons for the possession and I also find the ending after the true ending a ridiculous thing left open to an almost ridicule of possible sequels.","

This should be expected during any better than average horror film, and this one delivered.If I have to make one complaint, and it's a minor one, there was quite a bit of captioning making certain that viewers had to pay close attention.I'm not big on horror films, but IMO this one was better than what some other viewers have reported.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Elvis-Del-Valle","10 September 2023","Based on one of Father Gabriele's cases, the film presents us with this priest on a dangerous mission that goes beyond anything seen before. The story even presents something linked to the ancient Spanish inquisition that suggests that even the Catholic church itself can be seduced by evil and carry out acts that defy Catholic ethics. Looking at it from that angle, it is clear that The Vatican itself has a dark past that it tries not to repeat, since that led a large part of humanity to turn its back on the faith as a consequence. What the film does is focus on the sins of the church itself and how the evil entity present can use that as a weapon. It really becomes a film with a fascinating premise, beyond being just another film about exorcisms. Furthermore, the evil entity proves to be a much greater threat unlike other demons seen in other exorcism films. Russell Crowe plays a priest who is quite charismatic, tragic and disturbed at the same time. A rather peculiar combination for a priest. What is also notable is the inclusion of veteran Franco Nero as The Pope and he has a fairly subtle participation that made it worthwhile for Franco Nero to return to the big screen. The digital effects become a bit obvious, but all those supernatural scenes that even become fantastical, give the film a very good flavor. There may have been some loose ends, but The Pope's Exorcist is really a good film that fulfills its purpose. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","ethanbresnett","24 April 2023","In the same way that cinema goers appear to be suffering from superhero fatigue, I can't help but think that the horror genre is suffering from exorcism fatigue.There have been so many exorcism films and this one doesn't really stand out from the crowd. It treads over the same ground that dozens of films have covered before. Everything about it feels rather cliche and formulaic. There are some interesting elements to the story but they aren't really developed until the final act, and never really get going.Crowe is a strong lead, and rises to the often tongue in cheek script with ease. At times though the film treads a little too much into the camp arena and undercuts the tension.The setting feels too cliche to be scary and overall the tone is a bit disjointed to inject any true suspense into the piece.Ultimately this film is fine, but it just doesn't stand out at all. When the horror genre is pumping out kooky hits like Barbarian and genuinely creepy pieces like The Black Phone, it's hard for a film like this to find its place. If you want a quick cheap thrill, this will deliver, but it will almost instantly be forgotten.","

Quite frankly, I'd say this movie didn't scare me one bit. Plus the Russell Crowe depiction of the whiskey-drinking, joke-cracking exorcist, the least scare I expected going deeper into the movie. What I didn't expect to be wowed by is in fact how the movie depicts the relation between our own sin, guilt, God's forgiveness, acceptance of that forgiveness, and afterward claiming the power to banish the devil in God's name. It all adds up to the bible's description, sans the need to recognize the demon's name in order to banish it proper. Maybe I just forget the biblical reference, but I remember they did that too in the Conjuring.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","andrewpetrouap","8 April 2023","A very poor film full of cringeworthy moments and ridiculous unintentionally funny themes and scenes.The sight of a huge portly Crowe confronting and chatting with a allegedly possessed tiny skinny kid, is stupidly hilarious: it tears a huge hole into any semblance of believability.The plot becomes a tedious, convoluted Dan Brown silly mess.Watching a very overweight Crowe use a very tiny mini scooter to supposedly move another massive weight is farcical. The movie is filled with such cringeworthy scenes which culminate in a crock of bad cgi ideas.Crowe's best scene is when he voraciously guzzles whiskey from a silver vial with all the gusto of a true alcoholic.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","athanasiosze","29 August 2023","1) This is better than i expected, i agree with some reviewers here, but it could have been even better. Too much CGI, why? It should be less cartoonish. No need for all this pandemonium (no pun intended!). Demon would be more menacing if he talked less, in any case, not with that voice. I disagree with some reviewers here saying that it looks like a comedy/horror, no, it doesn't. However, it should be scarier. Less noise and style, more substance. If i was not a Christian, this would be no terrifying experience, for sure.2) Having said that, this is a very good horror movie, exciting at times. All the actors here do a good job, and Crowe is excellent. His Gabriele Amorth is one of the most interesting characters in horror movies. I didn't know anything about him. I read some things, as it seems, Crowe portrays him well. Ending was the best part of the movie.3) I don't know what is real and what is fiction here, but it seems realistic to me. Demon in this movie had a plan. Take a look at Vatican today. If there was a plan indeed, what do you think, did it fail or succeed? (Just kidding. Maybe)","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Inteshari","30 July 2023","This movie was top-notch. It wasn't a mindless horror flicks. There was depth to it. Stories that show that there is something deeper going on with everyone. Dialogue, the acting, the cinematography, everything was upto the mark.How our guilt makes us vulnerable, and if we accept our mistakes, learn from them, seek atonement, do the right thing, we become much much more powerful.The movie was critical of some practices of the Vatican but it was not an all out attack, which was refreshing to see.If you are a fan of mindless horror flicks, this movie is NOT for you. If you like deep, dark, thought-provoking psychological battles and the power of good over the evil, then you will love it.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","hildimre","9 April 2023","There were a couple of funny mistakes in this movie - Russell is sent to Spain by the pope, effective immediately. The next day, he arrives in super hilly Spain with his trusted scooter. Never mind the 1,800 km distance and the country of France which lays in between Italy and Spain. The same scooter was used as heavy machinery, when he moves a solid well-cover in rainy, muddy conditions.Also, the 'possessed' kid is tied down to the head of the bed, although he never even attempts to leave the bed for the entire movie....
Russel has a sense of guilt becuase in WWII he survives a Nazi ambush - all his comrades are killed but he makes it with a smear of blood in his forehead. Where is the guilt part in it?!The Pope vomits blood and seemingly recovers in no time - of what illness? If it is the work of the devil, why mess around with Russel 1,800 km away in the Spanish forest?By the way, the abbey - it sits in the middle of nowhere, yet electricity comes on and off as if it was attached to a city grid. No power supply station or anything.And last but not least - Russell tells the novice priest that saying a praying in Spanish is 'even better'. Should we tell it to everyone who doesn't speak Spanish?","

The story felt a little bit ""forced"". Kind of someone trying to excuse the inquisition. I would have enjoyed a little bit more back story from the family.The performance of the actors were good, mostly the kid. For some one his age I think he did a great job. It got into my attention that the exorcist travelled in a scooter from Rome to Spain, I don't even know if that is possible.It still not better than the original exorcist but, definitely not a scary movie but worth watching.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","cj70","7 May 2023","As if we haven't seen enough terrible exorcist movies since the original and unsurpassable The Exorcist.This movie damns the whole canon of terrible exorcist movies with one cliche after another. The deep raspy voice of a man as the voice of a demon coming out of a child. Staying in a spooky old house and repeatedly staying there or going back into the room where the boy is possessed. Approaching the possessed child when you know it's going to attack. Flames, people flying about. Every cliche in the book is trotted out to torment the viewer.Are there any positives to this movie? Sadly not. Russell Crowe gives us a modified version of his character Zeus, from the god awful Love & Thunder, only with a more Italian flavour. And frankly, since doing any notable acting turn, he seems happy to turn up in any old movie, do his schtik, and get a pay cheque.The other characters are very forgettable and it's nice to know this movie will forever remain a stain on their CV.If you want to watch a good movie with fine acting just watch The Whale.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","DBlackthorne","19 August 2023","The Catholic Church crumbles beneath its own hypocrisy. Plus the secret sins of the two priests assigned to 'exorcise' /Asmodeus\ from a boy recently come to live in a Spanish Castle with his sister and mother.The slanted biopic features the story based on preeminent exorcist Fr. Gabriele Amorth, and assistant Esquibel, who harbor a plethora of transgressions, exploited by the devil.Description and location really gives the impression that it is actually Trasmoz, the only place designated by the roman church to preserve witches & warlocks - the utterly damned who cannot be saved, nor wish to be. This is due to the notion of the macrocosm & microcosm. Heaven, world, Hell, dualistically reflected upon the mortal plain as it is ethereally. So if the so-called ""holy see"" is reflective of 'heaven', Trasmoz is Hell on earth.For a possession movie, the demon appropriately proves extremely powerful, revealing holy lies left and right, allowing him ingress, and the multiplication of nightmare materialization, according to subject. Thus, a shadowmantic dynamic.Again, the host was set to expire, and thus departed to fresh flesh elsewhere. Despite their efforts, ultimately results in failure as the demonic influence proves too pervasive worldwide. And thus the subsequent increased implementation of exorcism initiatives.The film is intense, with fantastic effects and great writing, acting. Of note, She Sells Sanctuary by The Cult in the soundtrack.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","faranak-tiba","9 May 2023","In this movie, viewers will find themselves sorely disappointed by the complete absence of anything fresh or groundbreaking. Rather than pushing the boundaries of storytelling and artistry, it opts to be a mere imitation of other films, displaying a conspicuous lack of creativity and originality. What's even more disheartening is the wasted opportunity to create something truly remarkable, especially when there is so much talent and potential within the film industry.It's a tremendous shame to see filmmakers resorting to recycling old ideas and concepts rather than investing their energy into crafting unique and captivating stories. This approach not only does a disservice to the audience but also stifles the growth and evolution of the industry as a whole.One can't help but question the motivation and rationale behind making this movie in the first place. Was it purely for financial gain, or was there a misguided belief that the formulaic approach would somehow resonate with audiences? Regardless, the end result is a film that leaves viewers feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied.In an era where there is an increasing demand for original, thought-provoking content, it is both perplexing and frustrating to see movies like this being made. Audiences crave innovative narratives and rich, complex characters, and it is the responsibility of filmmakers to rise to the challenge and deliver on these expectations.Unfortunately, this movie falls woefully short of the mark, offering little more than a hollow, uninspired rehash of what has come before. It serves as a stark reminder that, in order to push the boundaries of cinema and create truly memorable experiences, filmmakers must embrace originality and take risks, rather than settling for the safety and predictability of the tried-and-tested formula.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","kmkevinn-64733","18 April 2023","Great cinematography, solid acting, at times more amusing than frightening. Plot was highly suspenseful, if not cliched. But it doesn't really go deep enough into exploring the castle's origins or history. The foolhardy protagonists must've had massive balls to keep coming back for more like they did. Just nothing seemed to phase the exorcist or his sidekick priest, as long as they could recite some holy prayer.The faith that they all embodied to save the boy was the underlying message. It raised a point that if there were no such evil, perhaps in the form of the devil Himself, then what really is the purpose of churches and religion?! This catalyses the underlying allusion to the shadow side or id during their momentary disarrays, among suppressed confessions.Worth watching as there isn't a dull moment - best enjoyed as a cinematic horror movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. In terms of screenplay, think indiana jones meets the exorcist with a hint of scary movie, but without the corniness (it's not 18+ rated after all).I suppose the exorcist's suaveness all throughout was accounted for when he finally took a valiant swig of drink from his vial at the end. Oh and the many books he authored as Amaroth were rather good indeed... as in good versus evil!","

This is Russell Crowe speaking Italian.His name bought me to watching this film. I have seen more than my share of average or even below average exorcism films. I did not expect much from it but came in watching it with an open mind.This is a serious film that somehow managed to steer away from the pitfalls where all other wannabe films have failed. It is not generic with lazy writing and predictable endings. The writing is considerably better than most that have tried and failed.Russell Crowe (Father Gabriel Amorth) is the front end centre of all that is great about this film. He is charismatic & brings a warmth believable pope character that is in possession of devine expertise with an injection of humour. The supporting cast are all decent. The possession scenes and the storyline are done expertly. You can tell that particular care was taken to ensure this film will succeed where others failed.","

I wouldn't say I'm generally a fan of movies with Russell Crowe in them, but I did enjoy this movie.It's a good take on the whole demon possession theme, with some homage to the original Exorcist film. The story centres around a family that moves to an old Abbey they've inherited from their deceased husband/father. While renovations are going on, an old kl buried secret is revealed. The young boy gets possessed and it's up to the popes exorcist (Russell Crowe) to help the boy and banish the demon.Along the way, the exorcist reveals the reason behind the demonic possession and the dark history of the former Abbey.Maybe not as scary as the original but there's some good special effects, a little bit of humour added in with a few jump scares. If you can get over having to read a lot of subtitles, it's not a bad movie.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","atklein-90191","16 September 2023","An artless, rushed outing that tries to combine elements of Davinci Code with The Exorcist.As someone else mentioned, it's hard to know whether we are supposed to take this seriously or treat it as the cheap parody it actually is. If movies were a checklist, this one manages to check off all the generic beats of an exorcism flick. But it rushes through the setup and setting, introduces virtually zero original concepts, and leaves you without any feeling of urgency or concern for the characters. Performances are either entirely flat or cranked up to 11 (out of 10), likely due to lack of context from the contrived script.Perhaps most egregious is how this movie attempts to skate by, appealing to our collective fondness and familiarity with Friedkin's infinitely superior Exorcist film. Don't be fooled. Any commonality between the two begins and ends with the title.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Mike_Devine","10 September 2023","By 2023, the ""priest investigates allegedly possessed person and attempts to save them"" plot has been done to death, going all the way back to the 1973 original that started it all. Therefore, it's not surprising that 'The Pope's Exorcist' is a mediocre-at-best telling of yet another spooky case that needs solving.There's no denying Russell Crowe's starring role here makes 'Exorcist' worth a watch, as the actor's storied career is more than enough evidence that he can bring it. In his portrayal of the no-nonsense, flask-carrying Father Amorth, he brings a sense of gravitas that sets him apart from others who've carried this torch in past films (and he is a foil to Daniel Zovatto's inexperienced Father Esquibel). But as we've seen time and again, acting can only take a film so far.While 'Exorcist' has its fair share of jump scares and ""shock and awe"" moments as the two priests try to aid a widow and her children who just inherited a troubled Spanish abbey (worst lottery ever), it feels very ""retread"" for the most part. Yes, the setting is creepy and intriguing...at least, more so than the typical suburban house where these movies take place. But there are shades of less tolerable films here, including 'The Nun,' that make it feel like we've been here and done this. There is a twist that history buffs may find interesting, and the tie-in with the politics of the Vatican isn't ordinary, but the execution of the screenplay leaves much to be desired.It's fine to give this 'Exorcist' a try, but don't expect any real out-of-body experiences.","

THE EXORCIST. It and the film from 1982, 'The ENTITY' are still the two most scary films I have ever seen; because they are based upon facts. Modern schlock horror does not compare.I can only explain it as it is in the title for this review. Any more and I would be giving the good away. It is a surprise to see Russell Crowe as a priest but he is excellent in the role. The people who say that 'its just the same old type of Exorcism style film' are unequivocally wrong! There has never been a scripted story that was not about the beast just causing havoc to innocents on Earth. This one was original in that possession of great length would kill the currently possessed and, the beast was was there for payback on the Russell Crowe priest character; who has been a successful Exorcist for 20-30 years., But more importantly it was there to bring down its revenge upon the Vatican! Its tense, its scary, it superbly acted and it ticks most of the boxes that makes for a good film!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","davidgee","28 April 2023","This is a lot less schlocky than I expected. The demonic possession we see here, a small boy in Spain, brings unavoidable echoes of Linda Blair's Regan in the 1973 movie. The demon speaks in a guttural voice. The boy levitates and also hurls people across the room by pure mental power. Writing appears on his skin.But despite the recycling there are many genuinely goose-bumpy moments. The boy (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) is believably desperate. Russell Crowe and his young sidekick (Daniel Zovatto) give measured performances, not too shouty. Franco Nero as the Pope is still a commanding screen presence at 81.The last quarter of the film goes into CGI overdrive, bringing THE MUMMY remakes to mind, but even if the ground is a bit familiar, this is an exciting and entertaining way to revisit it.","

It's pretty much impossible to be original with this niche genre.However....as far as they go it was pretty good! The best I've seen for a while.Russell was good, apart from sounding more like a Serbian veteran than Italian.Was it scary? Not really. There were times when we were laughing at it rather then be scared. They made a valiant effort at adding a Da Vini Code style of plot so that it wasn't a rinse and repeat of other similar movies.There were pretty good effects on the possessed one. Good acting all around, which is rare for this type of movie!Overall I thought it was a good attempt. Everything was done reasonably well without anything being outstanding. If they wanted to take it to another level I feel there could have been more shock/scare moments that genuinely wanted you to grab a cushion to hide behind. But that's subjective on my part.Worth a watch!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","Screen_O_Genic","13 May 2023","One of the best and most gripping Horror flicks of recent years, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" is highly-charged drama on the deepest and most fundamental realities and truths of existence. Gabriele Amorth is the chief exorcist of the Vatican and highly regarded at what he does. Independent and cavalier with his superiors he has his brushes with the authorities. When a young boy is possessed in Spain he is sent to help the child and what he faces is more than he expects and will unearth all the complexities of his life which he will have to face and surmount in order to accomplish his mission. Good direction, acting, pacing, cinematography, special effects and music fuel this edge of your seat thriller. Russell Crowe is a natural in the lead role with his burly and flippant demeanor and the supporting cast adequately help carry the film through. Although the clich√©d scenes that usually accompany these films are in full display and the typical pc tinge tags along as usual the power and message of the film washes off the cack like holy water on undesirables. A primal and profound examination on good and evil, life and God, ""The Pope's Exorcist"" reminds us of life's purpose and the one, the only one, we can trust to help us get through and the only one who matters.","

It was a little bit different, Russel Crowe's character, the priest who carries out the exorcisms had a sense of humour, much to the disgust if those above him. It was the usual trope, child becomes possessed and needs an exorcism. However, the young boy that is the victim is just not scarey, he doesn't make you jump or do anything remarkable. Even the accent the demon possessing the child has a British northernish/cockney accent and it just isn't scarey it's sort of amusing. This character was mis cast and needs some work.

I can agree Having Russel Crowe play the exorcist was great but Anthony Hopkins already nailed that role and he did it better than Crowe could. By default this can only get a 5 because you're watching the same exact thing over again. Mocking God ""what's you name?!"" ""Don't address the demon directly"" ""Pray"" ""Unclean Spirit"" I mean it's all there and all the exact same... The movie takes place in an Abby which screams ""The Nun."" With all that said it's worth a watch because it's funny at times and it is a horror movie about exorcism.

"The Pope's Exorcist","therealjaysmoke","3 May 2023","From the opening scene, you could tell that this was going to be an epic movie and boy, I wasn't disappointed. It had everything you would expect from an exorcist movie. The demons, the crosses, the flipping and flying, the prayers, the wall climbing. It was great.However, I don't think there was anything here that we hadn't seen in other excorcist movies and I think that's where this movie lets me down. The story was ok, the acting was ok, the cinematography was ok but it was too long with very little happening, I wanted something more. It didn't have the depth that a movie like The Conjuring had and maybe it had to do with the kids. The little boy just looked too innocent to pull off a mean looking demon, the girl child was too annoying for me to care what happened to her and the mother just didn't push herself hard enough. Also I felt that their memories were too weak and uncreative.All that being said, I believe that this will be loved greatly by all Catholics and conservative Christians even though there are some curses, some alcohol and cigarette consumption and some boobs. Overlook all these and you will have a faith based movie that will make any Christian proud.Judging by how it ended, I believe this will be turned into some sort of a franchise.

"The Pope's Exorcist","Jack_B_Nimble","10 May 2023","Greetings movie enthusiasts. First a disclaimer. I don't believe in demonic possession, not even a little bit. I've seen videos that claim to show actual exorcisms and I remain unconvinced. I didn't enjoy the original Exorcist or the subsequent sequels. I consider projectile vomiting silly and made all the more so by James Wood's hilarious sendup of the original as Father McFeely in Scary Movie 2. Worst of all is the very real possibility that, due to demonic possession films, real life children with Tourette's, or Epilepsy, or ADHD might be subjected to the trauma of an actual exorcism. It can happen.However, much to my surprise, The Pope's Exorcist worked for me. I was drawn into its odd, dark and bewitching world. Russell Crowe was great as always. He brought warmth and humor to the role of Father Gabriel Amorth. Whether you're Catholic or not he's the sort of priest you'd like to sit next to at a dinner party.Peter DeSouza-Feighoney was perfect and terrifying as the possessed boy. No, his head didn't spin around three hundred and sixty degrees. He didn't have caked on makeup an inch thick and, I'm happy to report, he didn't misuse a cross. He didn't need to resort to such cheap tricks to be spine-chillingly nightmarish.The most spellbinding parts of the film were the conversations between Crowe and the boy, but those moments were far too brief. Imagine that you're a priest, or not a priest, and fate has cast you the opportunity to speak with an actual demon. You're conversing with an unholy and supernatural being, something not of this Earth, a creature of darkness and sin.Wouldn't you be tempted to ask the demon about his existence, his views on freewill, his views on morality and on God? Was he created depraved or was he once pure and now fallen. And if fallen why? The mind boggles at the possibilities but this movie doesn't address those issues.In the extended cut of The Neverending Story Atreyu didn't ask the G'mork his name. There was no need for that. The boy already knew it. Instead Atreyu asked his antagonist, ""Who are you really and what makes you so wicked?"" Those are the very questions that Crowe should've asked the demon who inhabited the boy. I'd like to know the answers.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","MattTB87","6 May 2023","First up, massive respect for the makers of this to not have a single jump scare in the entire film. That should show you what we're dealing with here; Action thriller, rather than horror.There are of course horror elements, but this is more akin to Constantine or The Last Witch Hunter, an overly serious but totally solid 6/10 action film with both too much and too little exposition.Crowe gives a decent performance, as does the kid, he's like a de-aged Andy Serkis and honestly is great, but again, let me remind you, this is not a horror film in any way and honestly, it should never have been marketed as that. Because as an action thriller, it's perfectly fine.7/10 - would action thriller again.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","hanianuar","1 June 2023","Coming from someone who's easily scared, it wasn't scary at all. Best they tried were the loud jumpscares and even those were predictable. The consistently criminal lightning n rain effects throughout the movie threw me off tbh üò≠. Also the kids demon voice is just silly. The start was very cliche, an american orphaned family moves into an inherited haunted mansion and starts getting possessed. Other than that, the Storyline wasn't too bad imo.. maybe if they were executed well enough i wouldnt be so critical (the acting was noticeably bad). I dont know how they imagined to appeal to the audience but i was not scared, not interested, not emotionally invoked, and not laughed (although there were a few poor attempts)...","

"The Pope's Exorcist","comps-784-38265","24 April 2023","This is the first semi-decent horror i've seen in some time.It's a solid workmanlike exorcism and demons plot with plenty of prayers and chanting. There is a view nods to predecessor films without being too cheesy or going over the top in gore. .Throw in the charisma and presence of Russell Crowe (on a Vespa) and he really brings 'The Pope's Exorcist' up another full notch or two on quality, and even throws in a pinch of comedy.Worth the price of a cinema ticket ? YesWould I watch this again? Possibly for a sunday matinee, yes.Without Crowes presence I would have said this film is 6 or 6.5/10 but his presence definitely raises it another full point.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","ce971665","2 June 2023","I must begin this review by stating that I am not accustomed to sharing my opinions on movies, but I am compelled to make an exception for this particular film, which undoubtedly deserves the ignoble title of the worst movie of the year. From start to finish, it is a train wreck of catastrophic proportions, with abysmal acting, an incoherent plot, lackluster writing, amateurish directing, a feeble story, and laughable CGI effects.To call this production a movie would be an insult. It feels more like an uninspired rehearsal or a half-hearted attempt at creating a coherent narrative. There is an utter lack of suspense-building throughout, and the absence of any truly frightening or amusing moments leaves the audience perplexed and unengaged. Scene after scene, the film descends into a pit of laughable, disjointed mediocrity.Even the presence of Russell Crowe fails to salvage anything from this movie.My advice to anyone considering watching this film is to save your precious time and seek entertainment elsewhere.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","CineviewUK","5 June 2023","Well Rusty hasn't lost any weight, in fact it looks like he's added some (for this role?!). I guess he had to give up fighting, but on the other hand I did enjoy him speaking Italian for some of his dialogue which was impressive.I struggle though to not draw immediate and glaring similarities between this movie and William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist) (1973). As soon as the kid Henry appeared in the first shot I knew it was him who would be possessed. The kid actor did a good job by the way.However overall it does lack the feness, tension and outright fear that Blatty's movie drew from it's viewer. Great sets and cinematography unfortunately doesn't help this movie as it doesn't offer anything new or original to the subject material at hand. You kind of feel like you've seen it all before.I watched it, but won't ever be seeking out a second viewing.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","MJB784","26 April 2023","I loved that they flipped the exorcism genre around and provided us with new ideas. Most of them have a teenage girl possessed, but this had two characters and then the exorcist towards the end. Also, it takes place in a mansion bought by the father who died in a car accident. The family being dysfunctional and the exorcist having a sense of humor haven't been in a possession movie I've seen. Nor do I recall one where a young boy is possessed by the devil and can bring back evil memories of failed exorcisms to the title character. The movie doesn't explain why the father had the mansion in his will though. Me and a friend of mine were quite scared.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","gpwdxrfv","18 November 2023","This is a good movie, good performances, sets, atmosphere but you can't escape that it's quite clearly The Exorcist with a gender change.Some of the dialogue is the same, the words under the skin, the two priests, the sexuality...obviously the genre only has so many things to work with and it's not too say this is a bad film because of that but at times I felt like I'd seen it before.The rest of the family being 'attacked' is a different spin, the professional telling the younger priest not to listen to speak with the demon was written by William Blatty.All that said I enjoyed it, but the original will always be one of my favourite films ever.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","khalidmoubile","13 August 2023","The Pope's Exorcist.Follow Gabriele Amorth, the Vatican's leading exorcist, as he investigates the possession of a child and uncovers a conspiracy the Vatican has tried to keep secret.First of all, watching this movie was almost a coincidence, it wasn't planned at all and suggested by a cousin to watch it together at the same exact moment.This movie is an average exorcist movie, a typical story expect of Russell Crowe being an Italian pope, yes it is a typical one nothing really was that special but at least it got me interested until the end.I believe that Russell was the best thing about this movie and without him this movie wouldn't hold-up together but unfortunately he couldn't do much about the movie itself, it's still not good enough , does it worth your time ?Not really, but if you're with a company and your curios how Russell Crowe looks like in this movie, go for it.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","AlchemicalFilms","7 April 2023","I'll come out and say it, The Popes Exorcist is difficult to like. The movie replays a lot of the tropes of exorcism/possession movies and it feels tired. Low gravel demonic voices? Check. People flying across the room? Check. Bodies misshapen? Check. It's all been done to death and there is nothing worth your time here.I got so bored that the question of ""why is Satan always bed ridden if he is so powerful?"" popped up. Perhaps this would be been more interesting?I digress...The good parts of the movie are the characterization of Father Gabriele Amorth and the conversations with the Pope. The theological debate piqued my interest, as did the council questioning Amorth's methods, but it was all too brief. The scenes within the underground chamber had promise, but then it went all Hollywood and ""the power of Christ compels you"" for the ending.We need to see something different with possession movies. As a filmmaker and writer, lazy scripts offend me. The film is presented reasonably enough but it just doesn't scare me, or make me want to see it again. The writing wheels out trope after trope and it could be a good drinking game.If I was being harsh, I'd say the movie is so bad that it is proof God doesn't exist. No benevolent force would allow it!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","HafizhMaulana21","9 October 2023","Based on the true story of Gabriele Amorth, a prominent Vatican priest who became the Vatican's Chief Exorcist. Father Gabriele Amorth is now handling and investigating the possession of a young boy amid the emergence of a conspiracy kept secret by the Vatican.Based on a true story, The Pope's Exorcist is one of the religious-themed horrors that is quite dark. Presenting the story of a priest who is famous for exorcism to his congregation, The Pope's Exorcist is enough to give a terrifying atmosphere in it. There are not many horror elements like in other horror films, but it is enough to provide tension and horror. The Pope's Exorcist for me wasn't very impressive and didn't feel enthusiastic in watching it in its entirety. The conflict of the story that for me does not appear convincing and too many scenes are over-dramatized. Likewise, there are many conflicts that become plot holes in it so that it becomes one of the less interesting pieces of the story. The conspiracies presented are also not very good so that overall this film feels responsible to have two conflicts. Overall, The Pope's Exorcist was quite good with Russell Crowe's performance which for me was quite slick.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","craigpb1976","7 April 2023","I'm not going to delve into this film, as there is nothing to delve into.Russell Crowe is in it, it couldn't be that bad, right? Wrong. This film is extremely bad, if it wasn't meant to be comical, or funny in some satirical way, then it's worse than I thought.One of the main problems is caring about literally anyone in it, I didn't, and I wouldn't know how you could.The biggest and I do mean biggest irritation is the possessed demonic voice over they gave the boy. Now as soon as I heard it, I wanted to laugh. It's corny, it's silly and it sounded like Rhys Ifans. There was nothing, and I do mean nothing, scary or creepy about any of the film. So if it was aiming for say, Sami Rammi territory, it fell way way short.I can't give any redeeming comments, I wanted it to be over half way through, and watching Crowe was painful, he was lost in a mire of plotless, badly written pulp.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","mikan2040","9 May 2023","Firstly, unless you believe in reincarnation or are happy to waste the one life we have on this earth....spend it better than watching this film. So where to start with this? It starts off as a generic, if weak, story about an Exorcist doing well Exorcist stuff. There isnt too much too it there isnt anything new that we havent seen in a hundred other films. A family is introduced as they move to Spain. You could easily be forgiven for thinking that as these are the victims of a demon they would be fleshed out as characters...you know so you give AF when something happens to them. Well in this case you would be wrong. The family are merely vessels for the story...I mean demon to happen. What happens in the next hour and a bit is a downward trek towards utter garbage. While the synopsis may not sound too bad...believe me when I say it is atrocious. I'm not going to go into more details as I'm not a critic and this movie has taken too much of my life already. There are zero pay offs and dont expect any jeopardy.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","ronterry55","19 April 2023","I love exorcist movies! I went to The Pope's Exorcist because Russell Crowe stars, and is based on an actual papal exorcist. This movie, and Russell, did not disappoint. It is a well done exorcist movie. Russell Crowe was terrific as the priest who was the Pope's Exorcist. It was lovely to see Franco Nero onscreen again as the Pope. The entire cast was wonderful. It was a decent script about a demon from the time of the Spanish Inquisition. I enjoy these movies depicting religious folk fighting against evil, especially when it relates back 500 years
The special effects and CGI were perfect. There were a few jump scares throughout the movie.It is a well done horror movie . The ending seems to set up for a sequel. I would enjoy that!","

"The Pope's Exorcist","buzzgary-61934","15 April 2023","A movie about historic religious ignorance to epilepsy and psychosis.While epileptic seizures may resemble possession they aren't due to anything supernatural.Same goes for psychosis. It's another medical condition in which hallucinations and delusional thinking are taking for reality.Sad that there is no mention of this in any other review.Exorcisms are often attributed to religious or spiritual beliefs and practices aimed at expelling evil spirits or demons from a person's body, mind, or soul. While some people believe that exorcisms can cure a range of physical, mental, or spiritual ailments, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.In many cases, the symptoms of supposed possession may actually be due to underlying medical or psychological conditions, such as epilepsy or psychosis. These conditions can cause a range of symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and altered states of consciousness, which may be interpreted as signs of possession by some.It is important to note that medical and psychological conditions require proper diagnosis and treatment by qualified healthcare professionals, and that exorcisms are not a substitute for medical or psychological care. In fact, attempting to treat these conditions through exorcisms or other non-evidence-based practices can be harmful and may delay or prevent effective treatment.While religious or spiritual beliefs are a personal matter, it is important to seek evidence-based medical and psychological care for any health concerns, including those that may be attributed to possession or spiritual causes.","

"The Pope's Exorcist","romanprv","3 May 2023","I don't think I ever saw a AAA movie with such a vast number of logical flaws and story holes. Sure, a movie is not a scientific paper but there has to be some kind of consistency and plausibility to keep it enjoyable. I'm a huge fan of fantasy, science fiction and horror but this flick makes even me wonder how it would make sense at all.As a fan of Russel Crowe I really wanted to like this film but I just sat there wondering how a demon powerful enough to possess a grown man is taken out of his body within seconds with a trick hardly a 6 year old would fall for. Further I admired the luxury the exorcist has to travel with his very own unique scooter(!) between countries. I also could not find an answer to the fact, that he still has to convince a mother to visit her possessed child while he was already announced by the Pope himself, travelled hundreds of miles (with his scooter) and the mother already accepted a priest in her home. To keep my amusement up, I witnessed an experienced underground worker lighting a small fire torch(!), instantly completely burning a bystanding co worker as if he was soaked in petrol. Moreover, no one can explain why the sister of a possessed child joyfully and carelessly listens to music in the room next door(!) while her younger brother suffers from possession, scratching his eyes out etc.Sorry, even a die hard horror fan like me who likes to oversee logical flaws in favor of a good story is not able to enjoy this trash. I give 3 stars, because acting, directing and setting are decent, yet a total waste to a story book written by a bunch of ... okay, I'll spare the insult.",NA
"The Pope's Exorcist","andrejmitrovski","11 May 2023","I have watched a lot of horror movies and this one might be in the top 3 of all time. Why? Because it's different. I'm used horrors to be scary, to have tension, to be dark and everything, but in this one Russell Crowe made something special. He combined the scary part of the movie with his humor which makes you interested even more during the scenes, because it's unexpected when he'll say something to even make you smile on something like this. For a horror movie these ratings are pretty high, but I'm going to agree with the audience and I'm going to rate it with 7/10. It's worth watching. It has some things that could be better ( ex. Spend more time on the blood at the end which I hated ), but overall solid movie.",NA
