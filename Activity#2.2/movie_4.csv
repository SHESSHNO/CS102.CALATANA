"kuuk3","6 September 2023","So the aunt was developing weapons. The daughter did not like that but wasn't the one running the company. Her dad designed those weapons and built his own, which she used. It didn't make sense. Besides, there is nothing wrong with building enhanced suits for soldiers, that will save lives, when your being invaded by alien armies every few years!The room with the alien tech in it, didn't have anyone guarding it. She pickpockets a pass and walks in, then walks out. Walking past the entrance to another corridor that did have a guard next to it. What was in that corridor that it warranted a guard? And this one with the advanced weapon in it did not? Then the scientist she stole the pass from, walks back into the room without his pass?The building it put in lockdown, but the boy just walks out. So much for lock down.The beetle suit (and OMAC) is never explained. It can seemingly do anything but how? Where do the bullets come from? How are they replenished? How is it charged?When they drain the suit for the code, they tell us repeatedly it will kill him. They drain the code, but he lives. So what a waste of time. A plot point that went nowhere.Blue Beetle doesn't want to kill. But the Uncle is willing to stab people with the bug mobile legs. Grandma machine guns down security guards just doing their job.The Uncle builds a localised signal jammer, and the building he uses it on with high-tech weapons inside doesn't hit the alarm when all their feeds go dead. Besides the fact that there was zero guards in the main lobby, and the blue beetle tech is in a display cabinet which can be picked with a paperclip?The uncle can pilot the bug mobile having never seen it before, just because he drives a truck. He knows where all the buttons are and how to do tight manoeuvres .","

"martinrobertson300482","11 September 2023","Everyone knows this is yet another dud by dc by now. But after hearing some positive buzz i thought i'd give it a chance. But nope. Its just another superhero movie.What it really is is just Ironman meets Spiderman. No one really cares about this character so they would have had to do something special to make the movie great. But they haven't. Cobra Kai's Xolo Maridueña is likeable enough as the hero. But everyone in this (except Susan Sarandon) is the hero. Either that or they're an annoying ""comedy"" sidekick.At least the action starts overshadowing the lame jokes at the half way mark. As before that its just the character getting thrown around as he discovers his powers. But even later its just robots fighting. This is something we've seen a hundred times at this point. But at least the hero doesn't fight Susan Sarandon in the finale.So i guess it could have been worse. Its not completely awful. There's just too many superheros now to care about this familiar feeling one.","

"HabibieHakim123","18 August 2023","I found Blue Beetle as the most basic teenage superhero origins story that are no longer special, and it leaves me no impress whatsoever because we all already way too familiar with this type of story, it's predictable and literally nothing new, it's bland and the action was boring, my face was literally straight the whole time, and the villain was also meh, what i like about Blue Beetle was the family dynamic that's definitely there, and the family itself as their own was good enough, Bruna Markuezine was good, including Xolo Maridueña himself was good and just if his story wasn't the same like most of teenage superhero origins story, Blue Beetle would've been something else because what i do like again was some of the cinematography, editing, the Blue Beetle suit was amazing and i really love it, and the special effects for the most part was good, but again overall i just can't found something new in terms of story, and it would've been just an ok movie but it's too bad that the action was boring and the comedy also didn't work, the villain wasn't that good, so it is what it is unfortunately, Blue Beetle is not a bad movie, it's a basic teenage superhero origins that fills with ok performances but a predictable and unoriginal story and also boring action and uninteresting villain.","

"Xstal","18 September 2023","It's sad, not unexpected, to say that it's a chore, as you've seen the story told here a thousand times before, no surprises or things new, this will really make you blue, all in all more than two hours, that will bore you through and through. The CGI is not that good, and it will not make you marvel, plus the story is predictable, and I might suggest - quite larval, the acting's amateur, so is the dialogue and score, it's a challenge after watching to applaud and not ignore.If we're really unlucky they'll make another one that will take us to places increasingly common in the world of Superhero desperation.","

"FeastMode","18 August 2023","Let's get the positives out of the way first. The musical score is pretty good, although not up to the normal DC standards for music. There are a couple of cool action moments. Half of the comedic attempts made me laugh. And I loved the intro artwork/music, it got me excited.The bad... sigh. Blue Beetle is fairly boring and had difficulty getting me invested. The majority feels generic with nearly everything having been seen in other superhero movies. The one it seemed to copy the most is Shang-Chi. Numerous aspects are nearly identical. Like the zany sister who never stops talking and gets him into trouble. It's the same character that Awkwafina plays. They even steal jokes from it. I knew the joke was coming because I had already seen it in Shang-Chi.But the biggest problem with this movie is that the protagonist doesn't drive the plot. Things happen TO him, not BECAUSE of him. And he is saved by something or someone an absurd number of times. It becomes laughable and makes it difficult to root for him.To make it worse, we have the stock-est of all stock villains. She's played by veteran actress Susan Sarandon. Not only was this a terrible casting choice, she gives an atrocious performance. Her line delivery is cringe. It doesn't help that the dialogue is terrible.I mentioned that half the comedic attempts made me laugh. The other half are awful. They were either cheesy or fully predictable. I knew exactly what would happen or what the punch line would be.This movie is also extremely dumb. It's mostly small stuff that can be ignored if it happens once or twice. But it happens 100 times, no exaggeration. I'll give an example. The enemy starts shooting at his friends. Rather than stopping the enemy who is right next to him, he turns around and runs towards his friends. Why? To yell, ""you guys need to get out of here."" It's just bad writing.I have no allegiance to DC or Marvel, but I truly feel sad for the die-hard DC fans. They continue to receive bad movies and have to watch as the once endless potential of the Snyderverse is thrown away.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 8/17/2023)","

"caomorte","19 September 2023","This is the worst thing I have ever seen. I'm not into the cancellation system kids have nowadays when there is prejudice or when it just looks like there is prejudice at stake but I think who wrote this doesn't mean it, maybe it was really written by a 10 year old.The stereotypical Latino family thing that reminds me of a Fast and Furious surrogate scenario but with clowns instead of braindead glorified criminals.I just want to regurgitate after watching this. My eight year old was bored like hell. She is way smarter that the guys who thought this was a good idea. The portrayal of the Latin community showed here isn't very serious. Off course there are happy positive resilient people in those communities but taking every stereotype and put it all at once in a family and making them look like the jesters is really annoying. This wasn't a fun movie, it's forgettable, it's the same old story again, it's meek, it has no villain , it's meh...
I wish superhero's could be treated more seriously than what they are getting this days. If you looked to South Korean show ""Moving"" you could learn a thing or two but no: the american paternalistic media society will only take that show and do a remake just because in their deranged conceptions Americans can't read and a foreign language is too annoying and capable of brain damage or creating communists or democrats as they call it there(Lol). Anyway, having a Batman (after Nolan) isn't enough. DC is way more childish and the CGI is always the worst but Marvel movies ,although better like their comics always were, are getting seriously damaged by the idea every hero needs to be Deadpool or Spider-Man copycats.Once again ,DC has shot itself in the foot, wait...it blew both feet with a single shot.","

"Tweetienator","19 September 2023","What you get are some okay action sequences and okay special effects. That's more or less the core of Blue Beetle. The story is one straight out of generic-not-so-wonderland, lacking any creativity and any juice (in my opinion, simply embedding a pretty standard story in another cultural context is not the work of a creative titan). At most, this flick will engage three or four of your brain cells. Moreover, most of the fun and comedy elements don't work too well either. These days, writers, directors, and producers seem to think that they can get away with anything because of the work of the special effects department - good storytelling seems an art mostly lost these days. Blue Beetle tastes like one of those chewing gums that have long lost all flavor. Unfortunately, there is no power of cheese to save this one with some decent high-octane schlock. My exact rate: 3.5.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","26 September 2023","College Graduate Jaime Reyes is chosen by a powerful Alien scarab beetle to be its host, bestowing him some amazing powers.I honestly started to question whether or not superhero films were no longer something of appeal to me, but I see from several reviews, that some people have a few similar problems thay I had, it felt like a Spiderman knock off, a not too successful one.I'm actually surprised that it was given a theatrical release, it seems more like one of those films that would silently make it's way onto a streaming platform, then just vanish into obscurity.I had no issues with the acting, Xolo Maridueña was pretty good, and it was great to see Susan Sarandon.The story was the major problem, we've seen it all before, it's a formula that's simply been done to death, and so much better, it offered nothing original.As a character, they might as well have done Wind Man or Giraffe girl, they'd have been so much more interesting.4/10.","

"tdsearles25","20 August 2023","ORIGIN: I am writing this as I watch the movie. So far the first 40 minutes are basically the combination of Spiderman(Iron Spider cant control suit), Ironman(the suit mimics Ironman in looks, function and design) and Venom(alien symbiote attempting to work with human host) origin stories. There is nothing new, fresh or interesting here. It has all been done before, only better.FOCUS: I like the family focus here. However, George Lopez is exhausting and cringe throughout. Kind of like Thor Love and Thunder dragging out the screaming goats joke; that is George Lopez in this movie. Very forced. Otherwise, the family focus works.DESIGN: The Blue Beetle suit and design is probably the highlight and coolest part of the movie. Though, its nothing too different than what we have seen Ironman, Spiderman or Venom do.VILLAIN/PLOT: Extremely weak, predictable, cliché and underwhelming. We all knew exactly where everything was going.XOLO MARIDUENA: I was really rooting for him. And he wasn't bad. But his acting skills don't always work. Maybe give him some more time to develop before handing him such a large role?TONE: Like the trend of recent superhero movies. The tone is Chaos. Think more chaos=better movie. Only when done correctly.VISUALS: Better than The Flash but that's not saying much.Overall, this is just more of the same. Look at Shazam 2, Thor Love and Thunder, Flash, Antman 3. The trend of new superhero movies are trying too hard, cringe, not doing anything fresh and overall very average movies.As a side note. DC is dying, sadly. What is this, 7 flops in a row? Call me crazy but I don't think fans are too thrilled about the announced reboot. OR they'd be showing up to the box office? $24m opening weekend? Yikes.Its a shame. Blue Beetle has a ton of potential! Wish he could have been a stronger part of the Justice League down the road.","

"pinkled5","19 August 2023","The dialog in the very first scene was so bad that I couldn't help but laugh out loud. I hoped it would get better, but it didn't. Every line Susan Sarandon's character says is some of the worst written dialog, and not even her acting chops could salvage it. But it's not just her character, the entire movie is full of terrible exposition presented in what seems like the laziest manner possible.The plot is paper thin, too. The only thing the main character wants is money to save his parent's home. Everything that happens to him is caused by happenstance, serendipity, or a ridiculously hard to believe contrivance. I was given no reason to root for any of these characters.I did like how they tried to develop the family dynamic, and I was hoping I could rally around that, but even that was clunky, at best. I had the urge to walk out from the very opening scene, but I forced myself to stay for nearly an hour. Eventually, the urge became too strong and I could no longer overcome it, and left the theater about halfway through.I'll give this a 3/10 because the actors were trying their best with what they were given, and it really showed in their performances. I especially enjoyed George Lopez's performance, but it wasn't enough to save this film. I also thought the CGI was pretty good (except for the shot looking up inside the Kord building, that shot looked rough).","

"MiroslavKyuranov","16 August 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is simply B or even C grade super hero movie with some charm along the way. I don't think it will be realistic to expect something else to be honest. The trailers showed that pretty well in my opinion.The tone of the movie is close to that of ""Shazam!"", given the fact that the family got bigger role in it again, that said the story is not all that good. Not that ""Shazam!"" got some epic story, but I think it was one idea better.The cast is fine, maybe the best part of the movie is the family dynamic, except when they lean too much to the melodrama side. Xolo Maridueña as Jaime/Blue Beetle and George Lopez are the standouts no doubt.The villain is everything you ca expect from B grade super hero movie, from the introduction, through his motivation, the fights and the conclusion is nothing particularly memorable.I must say the suit looks great when is practical and not CGI all over the place. There are some cool fight scenes with our protagonist, most of which are shown in the trailers, which is kinda of a shame.There are plenty of jokes in the movie, but for me, most of them doesn't land. I mean they are too childish. I guess the younger auditory will laugh out hard, but me and my cinema crowd were silent most of the time. Of course there were funny moments, but don't expect ""Deadpool"" level laughs if you are a bit older.The movie is not bad, but it's kinda cringe, predictable and given the fact that the audience know this genre already, they expect something more clever, which sadly to report ""Blue Beetle"" is not.There are already enough talks about the future of this character, is it part of the DCEU or DCU, will there be a sequel, or the character will transfer in the newly formed universe? If you ask me, there will not be a second movie, because this one will bomb hard, also, I'm not sure how you can do clean slate without the bagage of the previous universe, when you always lean to what was, not what it can be. In other words there is always a chance to see Blue Beetle again, but who will portray it and will the origin story be 1:1 identical is something I'm not sure about and I don't hold my breath for it.In conclusion the movie is ""okay"", got its moments, but there is nothing really memorable, also there are two credit scenes, which are fine I guess.","

"benjaminskylerhill","17 August 2023","For a movie being heralded as one of the least-white superhero films, Blue Beetle is white in one respect: it's as bland as plain white bread.Starting with a couple positive remarks, newcomer director Ángel Manuel Soto has a keen eye for action. There's a rough-and-tumble quality to his camerawork that makes the fast action intermittently fun. The performances are also quite fine, with George Lopez being the primary standout and the one bright spot of personality in the film.That's about all in terms of positives. This script has the intelligence of an actual beetle, the tact of a jackhammer, and the consistency of a pandering politician.Characters? Bland. Jaime, our protagonist, complains and is cowardly until the film's last 20 minutes when a character arc is rushed upon him with no skill or feeling.Plot? Perhaps the most predictable I've ever seen in the genre. Every single moment of the movie plays out exactly as you think it would. I predicted the end of literally every single scene. Not an ounce of creativity is present in this piece of writing.Dialogue? Inane. It's always contrived, corny, and shows blatant disregard for its audience's reasoning capabilities.In short, it's a sometimes flashy piece of total redundancy that's a complete bore from start to drawn-out finish.","

"deveshk-51057","14 September 2023","I'm a big fan of superhero movies and especially DC. I really loved the style of Man of steel. I love that DC takes the time to make action and movies more intense in their fight sequences and also does a great job at setting up characters and making you care about them.Well this movie literally just had me bored and I don't know what else to say. The only good part was the family dynamic in the movie which was nice to see but I really found myself caring very little about the characters and the villain is extremely average and uninspired.The fight scenes I just very bland and it seems like there's a lot that happens but they were just boring and very average even though they try not to be. This movie really made me contemplate why I even watch movies anymore and how predictable cinema has become instead of being something that should ignite the senses and the imagination and this was the complete opposite of that and has made me not go and watch random superhero movies anymore.I've never given any marble or DC movie of 4 out of 10 and this is the first because it just felt like a waste of my time and at no point was I excited and in fact I actually walked out in the middle of a fight scene with 25 minutes left to go in the movie.","

"hongsc","19 September 2023","Blue Beetle isn't one of the well known DC characters. My only experience with him was from the Young Justice cartoons, which was positive. Blue Beetle is another DC superhero movie failure. A Latino superhero movie that was predictable, had uninspiring characters, a weak, boring villain, and a movie that played too much on Latino stereotypes. This could have been an inspiring Latino superhero movie that many could have related to and enjoyed instead it became a jumbled, boring, amateurish mess. No, even Nana couldn't save this mess of movie. The sad part is that the 2 leads seem to have amazing chemistry together based on their rounds of promotions. But have none in the actual movie. And based on the quality of the movie, it should have been direct to Max not worthy of a theatrical release. How many poorly made DC/WB movies can be made? All I can say is a wise man once said, ""That the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result."" Can James Gunn save the DC universe? Stay tuned!","

"anabel-paz1","4 September 2023","It was so bad I couldn't stand to finish watching it and left the theatre. It's boring, and the jokes are plain awful - playing them over and over like the one for Maria la del barrio, or scatological jokes. I can't even fathom how the Mexican actors in there are okay with the simplistic, absurd, and ridiculous portrait of a family of immigrants depicted in this film. Xolo Maridueña's range of acting is clearly short. Are there really no better Mexican-descent actors in Hollywood? Disappointing. Having Susan Sarandon is not enough to save this disgrace of a film - her character is hollow and exaggerated. It's no surprise why DC's films performances are so low (in both the ticket office and quality) compared to those of Marvel. The love interest is predictable and forced. What a way to waste money and time this film is. I truly advise you not to watch it. It's not fun, like, at all. I had no expectations and either way, I was utterly disappointed.","

"dextermorgan-91603","19 August 2023","Welcome to yet another hot garbage by WB studios. This cannot be a movie written by humans. The dialogue is just beyond gut wrenching puke. No way this was written by a sanely functioning human. Has WB lost its mind completely? From Immigration to name mispronounciation, poverty and other such blatant in-your face tropes about the latin american genpop. What were they trying to achieve here? Score ESG points for appeasing the ethnic minorties ?Susan Sarandon is completely wasted and reduced to a script reader with a monotone voice. The physical thrreat aka bad guy has to be the THE worst character ever produced in the history of movies. With a singular expression on his face and no character development he was punching bag for the protagonist. The supporting cast is headache inducing with non-stop conversing in their own colloquial terms much of which is left to be deciphered. Horrendous doesn't even begin to cover this movie. Steer clear and wait for streaming after all this movie was meant to be a streaming release initially, so that just tells about its quality.

"cgzhjq","19 September 2023","I would honestly rate the movie lower but the sort of beautiful landscape of the movie was rather enjoyable to look at. I am not entirely sure why I was reading a news article before this movie came out where they said ""this movie is a win for Hispanic people"" thought I'm living in Romania, most of my friends live in Spain and not a single one of them felt like this movie was a win of any sorts. Anyways, the plot of the movie is bland and overdone, maybe if it came out in 2015 it might have been rather enjoyable since they hype was there, although I highly doubt it since the dialogue literally made me gag throughout the entire movie.I can't say I'm disappointed in this movies flop, but I'm not surprised either. Main stream media and entertainment has been nose diving in recent years, so I guess this movie decided to join the kamikaze.","

Now feel sad. Now you should feel a romance between the only two characters.

This a film that reminds me of the 90's children science fiction like power rangers.

"PedroPires90","16 August 2023","One of the biggest surprises of the year. It's also one of the funniest superhero movies ever with a very distinctive identity.There are some typical exposition dumps for the genre, and the emotional moments don't always hit the mark with a familiar structure, but it's a film with a huge heart, incredibly good humor, and excellent characters. All the ""good side"" characters are very well crafted and distinct, each of them having moments to shine.In technical terms, it has some surprises and tricks up its sleeve, with good editing, well-choreographed and entertaining fast-paced action, and a strong score and soundtrack. What's even better is the way it incorporates Latin culture to show us the true sense of community and family, elevating the film's message and contributing to most of the arcs.All the performances are outstanding. Madridueña has what it takes to be the star of this film and all of them deserve praises, but the best is the crazy uncle portrayed by George Lopez. Good movie even if you are tired of superhero movies.","

"chand-suhas","18 August 2023","For what it's worth, this is not an origin story yet is designed to be one, atleast for the main lead. After graduation, Jaime Reyes returns back to his family who are near bankrupt and on the verge to lose their home. Desperate to save the house, he looks for a job and lands at Kord Tower, after an invitation from Jenny Kord. Meanwhile, Kord Industries CEO Victoria Kord, is a greedy woman who wants to control an alien species Scarab for it's technological power, to create a deadly weapon. Jenny's attempt to steal this Scarab leads to Jaime getting hold of it and eventually becoming the host. What follows is, Jaime realizing his purpose and acknowledging his connection with Scarab.Blue Beetle clearly has arrived a decade late, which is also what works in it's favour. There is no pressure of building in/adding on to the DC universe. All it aims for, is to be a simple silly fun entertainer, going over the top at every opportunity and yet succeed in entertaining. This is simply not the kind of film one should take seriously. The humor is hit and miss, thankfully the emotions work well. The Latino superhero does leave a lasting impression. There is not much about the Scarabs so the film directly focuses on Reyes becoming the new Blue Beetle while casually dropping the fact that there were others before.Susan Sarandon's Victoria isn't evil enough whereas her own weapon Carapax isn't menacing enough and are barely serviceable. What does work is the goofiness of the Reyes family and right dose of father-son dynamic, because what's a DC superhero without that? The action set pieces are generic and like I said, the film still delivers on providing basic harmless entertainment. The post credit scene does set it up for a standalone sequel without burdening itself from being part of DCU's planned future.","

"willz187","20 August 2023","Blue Beetle is featured well in one of the Batman cartoons i think in the Brave and the Bold. In that he is a fun teenager trying to figure out his powers and how to help Bats. If you want to see a good representation of Blue Beetle i recommend finding this animated series. This movie kind of felt like Power Rangers on the CW network, albeit with a much higher budget. There was nothing to care about here. I think DC was stretching to find more characters to bring to big screen. He is a supporting character at best. It is a good comparison to Shazam 2 with all the focus on secondary characters. Both are a waste of money and a little on time. If you have nothing else to watch its ok.","

"pranayjalvi","19 August 2023","Blue Beetle doesn't suffer from the ponderousness that weighs down so many other DC movies. It's lighter, more fun, and delivers the jokes, bright colors and nods to the ridiculousness that you want from a superhero movie, a slight improvement than recent DC movies.The movie has a big heart, ambitious references, and moments that make it an entertaining watch, but it can curdle thanks to the constraints of the superhero genre. The cultural specificity is also an asset but feels rushed in a format that, unlike the pacing of a series, creates a greater imperative to get to the next battle. Though it may have some novel elements, the franchise already feels tired, and isn't much more promising than recent DC efforts ""Black Adam"" and ""The Flash.My Rating: 5/10.","

"adambenjamingibbons","21 August 2023","Let's start by just saying granny with a neon automatic gun. That says it all, 600 characters not needed. 4DX was pretty bad too. Bumps and shakes that just didn't make sense. Like a thud in the back when the door got kicked. Really, 4DX is trying to put me in the shoes of the door. Although as the characters were all wooden too, it probably wouldn't make much difference. I literally didn't care about any of the characters. They could have lived, or died and I wouldn't be bothered. Personalityless shells. Really silly film but also not funny, just lame. Usual poor Hollywood dialogue and unmemorable performances, with no story other than good guy has thing bad guy wants, bad guy chases good guy.","

"vandreren","21 August 2023","You've seen one, you've seen them all. Blue Beetle is about as cookie-cutter as the bombastic superhero mcmovie genre comes. This generic mishmash of the well and truly worn-out superhero template differs only in that it desperately tries to pander to demographic stereotypes and messaging. The origin story needs no description, you've already seen it a hundred times over in various films, tv shows or comics. Sarandon's mailed in performance as the villain was dull, wooden, and witless. As always, George Lopez played George Lopez as well as he knows how - with the voice of a badger and the personality of a telemarketer calling you on your personal cell at 9 o'clock at night. Some will say it's superhero fatigue. For myself, it's dumpster fire exhaustion. We need to get back to making great films for everyone. Great writing, acting and directing will always have universal appeal. Blue Beetle proves yet again that the Hollywood sludge factory is entirely incapable of providing it.","

"ajacayen-90247","17 August 2023","DCEU's 2023 has been at a dipping point. With the disappointment of Shazam! Fury of the Gods, in which the first one I really loved, and the somewhat decent of a Flash movie, it seems like the way the franchise is ending doesn't seem like a bang. Fortunately, Blue Beetle has already come out oh boy did it not disappoint.Now let me preface this: it is by no means a classic nor is it groundbreaking in the superhero genre. At the end of the day, I just want to have a good time in the theaters and, for the most part, it succeeds in what I'm aiming for: a fun time.Xolo Maridueña as the titular young Iron Man-like superhero, alter-ego Jaime Reyes, was really good. He brings a lot of energy to his performance filled with charisma, awkwardness and relatability because of his love for his family.Speaking of family, everyone was really good playing in their respective roles but George Lopez was easily the standout because of how funny his lines and reactions are towards Jaime.And the theme of the family is really at the center of Blue Beetle, it's really hard not to ignore it which is similar to Shazam. But as the film moves on, it does feel like everything that was done to make this possible was filled with heart by the filmmakers and knew just to be simply entertaining, hitting at all the right beats to make you laugh and cry.The pacing was surprisingly good as to how they were able to fill in the runtime which doesn't make it feel like two hours at all as you are watching it. It's like it took two to three days in the story, if you look at the second to the third act. That was really impressive.Visuals are great and the action sequences are really good to look at. Props to the director of photography, who by the way did Hereditary and Midsommar - yeah, let that sink in.Of course, the film is not without its faults. It is cheesy at times, does feel generic and doesn't seem like it wants to outshine the rest of the films not just in DC but everything superhero in general. But my personal issue would have to be how they handled Susan Sarandoncs character and the nemesis of Jaime. While I get where they are going, it felt like it needed to be more compelling and not just some cartoony villains.But by the end, I walked out of Blue Beetle thinking how good it was to see an enjoyable film with the message of family that hit me emotionally. Would I recommend the movie? Yes.","

"mindlessmoviemaster","21 August 2023","Yup that's how I knew the cringe movie was going to be as bad as it looked. This movie is just filled with cringe cliche stuff that they believe the Latino family is into. Blue Beatle needs his family to fight all his battles for him that's not surprising when you one these New Gen kids can't do anything without mommy and daddy holding thier hands and that's what this is all about. I was hoping this movie would do good too! Nope they had to ruin it with bad stereotypes. I guess that's fine stereotype it up man but BatMan is the Fascist.. I was wondering if they would take that out of the film cause they removed it from the trailers but nope they kept it in. They want to try a kill one of DCs best characters ever for a side character.. Go watch it if you love cringe cliches then this is the film for you.","

"akira-hideyo","19 August 2023","There seems to be alot of these such movies lately where something incredible is chosen for someone to be great and the so called chosen recipient of the gift or blessing is so non deserving with highly irritating low self esteem that one starts to cheer for the bad guys instead to end the audiences' suffering. What happened to real super heroes like John Wick or Jack Ryan where they wear their battle amour with responsible conviction and honourable mission to do good without a second thought. This show comes off the lot to fill the ethnic diversity quota in Hollywood of recent push. Yes, by all means, but for goodness sake, arm such protagonist with more oomph and self pride and courage. All needs a dash of Bruce Lee to make this porridge perfect for all future Goldilocks.","

"ethanbresnett","31 August 2023","Blue Beetle has the unique angle of bringing a Latin superhero character to the screen in a leading role for the first time, but outside of that nothing about this film is unique or original.The story is a formulaic superhero origin story. It's fine and it does the job but isn't particularly inspiring or overly engaging. There's an attempt to inject some emotion into the piece but it feels a little half-hearted. Susan Sarandon feels under-developed as a villain which makes the stakes feel quite low.For the most part the action is pretty bland. The final set piece is a CG blur that is a bit of a snooze and considering the skill set of Blue Beetle the action could have been a lot better.Despite all this, the performance from Xolo Mariduena is strong and he creates a likeable and engaging character, as do all his family members. There's some good humour throughout, and the film does look quite good in parts, with some decent enough direction.Overall, this film is a perfectly average superhero film. It's formulaic and uninspired, but it is a fun enough watch.","

"Ltufano23","28 August 2023","Blue Beetle comes at a time where Multiverses are breaking and worlds are ending, but it stays in its own corner and maintains a strong, grounded story with family at the center. The entire main cast are the heart of this film and the hispanic family dynamic feels so real and distinct. I found myself deeply connected to their story and invested in their emotional moments as if I were joining them on the journey as well. While it can be said that the rest of the story feels very repetitive from previous superhero films, that would be the biggest fault of the film. The action, emotion, and unique style leave a very memorable mark on the current state of superhero film. Had this been released 15 years ago, it could've been as big of a hit as any MCU standalone film, as it shares the same quality of the likes of Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Captain America. With the way superhero films have been, this is a breath of fresh air, even with the familiar taste.","

"AfricanBro","18 August 2023","I remember loving blue beetle in cartoons growing up so I was excited for this. I feel like people, generally speaking, aren't as hyped up for this. I enjoyed it but it was a mixed bag, there's nothing really adventurous attempted and for the most part, just felt good or okay enough. Too many things could've been done better.The family's dynamic was fine, yet the emotional connection between Jaime and Jenny was notably nonexistent- their attempt to forge it even prompted some to audibly scream no in the theatre. The actors' portrayal felt unconvincing, and the writing felt contrived, unimaginatively executed too. The familial bond is likely to resonate with fans later in the future, as evident in their concerted effort to show Blue Beetle is a family guy, along with the Perez family ethos. They really wanted to push that narrative and hammer it home. While I do know that in my brain, but I also wanted to feel that in my heart. James Gunn is a master at this, adept at bridging the gap between what I know and what I feel about a group of characters. They had too many family talks in my opinion, tried too hard. As for Blue Beetle himself, he's a character we'll love more the more we see him(I think), making his debut a respectable foundation for the future DC Universe. However, the ongoing controversy between DCU/DCEU and James Gunn's new vision might contribute to a diverse range of reviews.Pretty good comedic timing and the jokes didn't feel contrived. The suit had a cool design, and despite not having watched Blue Beetle cartoons in over a decade, it had familiarity. The transformation into Blue Beetle was strikingly done with a hint of horror, which I found compelling. I appreciated the mix of cartoonish yet realistic action sequences. There were still some 'fast and furious' ludicrous level action scenes.Some animations looked like video games with their 3D-like quality, and a few scenes lacked the grandeur suited for IMAX screens. The density of the visuals didn't match up, perhaps I'm influenced by the standards set by ""Oppenheimer,"" which was what I saw last in IMAX. Initially planned to watch in standard 2D, I went for the earliest available viewing instead.The story was a generic but it had a lot of interesting stuff in. Beyond the superhero himself, DC's attempt to bring some novelty into the genre was lacking. Some plot reveals didn't have the impact they should've. Improved character background execution, particularly for Nana and the main villain, was needed; their histories felt like it was mentioned only for plot convenience, notably the grandmother's history just because of how it was revealed. Some dialogue and plot towards the end was very predictable.Fighting scenes were mostly cool, although apart from the final one, they didn't reach their maximum climactic potential; only the last battle drew me in. The high personal stakes were great, clearly showing what was at risk and effectively following through on those stakes.A more serious and slightly darker tone would have heightened the emotional impact of the events in the third act. The movie seemed caught between taking itself very seriously and/or embracing a fun, lighthearted vibe, leaving an uncertain feel. It lacked a distinct impact or identity, floating in a sort of no man's land. If you didn't know Blue Beetle already or indifferent towards him, the film struggled to convincingly make you fall in love with the character or feel a connection. On the positive side, the movie showcased significant Latino representation. In terms of cultural blending, I'd rank Shang-Chi, Black Panther 2, Blue Beetle, Ms. Marvel, and then the first Black Panther.The movie excels in certain parts, while its shortcomings aren't overwhelmingly bad, but they could be better. Sadly, seemed to be more of the latter. The quick post-credit scenes were nice, sparing us from what often feels like a long wait usually. Loved that they included the previous versions of blue beetle, it's also quite rare for a superhero film to have a sense of standalone authenticity, rather than just serving as a vehicle to introduce new characters or set up future movies.I typically avoid badmouthing actors, but I believe acting could've been better. As previously mentioned, my earlier comment about the love interests still stands. The chemistry between the actors, the portrayal of emotions in their eyes-whether it was excitement, agony, or loss-and the conviction of the main villain didn't resonate with me. The lack of connection and genuine emotion felt like a first draft, and felt like a mid-2000s Disney show. This contributes to the feeling of a medley mixed bag, the dialogue, story, and acting all fell short of being amazing individually. While nothing was too bad, when combined, they accentuated each other, drawing attention to each.While far from flawless, I still left with a smile. The story was somewhat straightforward, and considering Blue Beetle's unique, I half-expected the movie to reinvent the wheel, though my hopes weren't too high. There were a lot of elements of a potentially mind blowing fantastic movie, It just doesn't feel like they were pieced together the best that they could've, but definitely still enjoyable. I know it's an origin story but it just feels like DC just played it super safe; and at a time when ""superhero burnout"" is a thing, playing it safe ain't too safe.","

"That_Movie_Watcher","17 August 2023","The marketing is letting this movie down! This film is so much more than just a origin story for a new superhero! This film has a lot of heart, with the directors love and care for this character being evident throughout the film! The character was introduced perfectly, and I hope it gets enough love to get a sequel because it deserves one! Also, so many touchy and difficult societal issues are brought up and tackled in respectful and nuanced ways. Their inclusion doesn't pull you out of the movie whatsoever! You aren't hit over the head with anything and these issues actually end up aiding the story and character greatly and give the film that much more of an emotional punch!The acting was phanominal as well! All of the actors gave amazing performances and really were able to convey each of the characters emotions beautifully in every scene!The action was by far the best part of the film! The camera angles and movements made you feel as if you were experiencing the fights irl! They were awesome!The comedy was also fantastic and handled perfectly! I found myself laughing every other minute at some points because the jokes were just so good! George Lopez was AMAZING throughout the film and really brought life to every scene he was in! Perfect casting!!Overall, I had a fun time with this movie and I highly recommend watching it!","

Are you people so hard up for DEI & Woke points that this is what you are making for 'Super Hero' movies????I am a moderate super hero/ comic book person and had never heard of Blue Beetle before this, why did you think you were going to get enough customers that would want to see this???Next, I know Blue Beetle is hispanic, but sorry, I don't know Spanish and too often they would be speaking in Spanish as if everyone in America speaks Spanish and WE DON'T... so either do it in English OR PUT IN SUBTITLES so we know that they are saying.Lastly, WOW... great job stereotyping hispanic people as if they are all loud and corny. This was one movie I was tempted to turn off most of the movie, but I was basically reading the news while watching the movie waiting for it to get good.... yea 3 out of 10. If you are really needing a super hero fix, I guess this could work for you.... but I would simply watch one of the Spiderman, Superman or Batman movies over again.","

"kuner-59029","18 August 2023","After the midly amusing The Flash, this is the final DCEU movie. The trailer looked bad already, but the final film is a boring mess. Blue beetle is generic, unoriginal paint by numbers superhero filmmaking, the 100% regurgitation of the same old tired formula. The story is basically ""Spiderman, but boring"".The hero is boring, the villain even more so, so they decided to make this some kind of ensemble movie with a quirky sitcom family. It doesn't work. Everyone tries to hard to be funny and likeable, that it feels faker than politicians smiling.In many ways, this is the filmic equivalent to the scene in Joker where he gets up on a comedy stage and tries in vain to make people laugh. It's sad. It's a waste of everyone's efforts and talents.Just let the superhero genre die already. Batman and Spiderman have some great story potential, but the rest is just played out. There's nothing more to be squeezed out of the genre.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","19 August 2023","When a teenager goes through a Cronenbergian symbiosis with a space scarab, he is targeted by the corporation that discovered it.I watch almost all of these comic book adaptations, and it's rare that I see one with this much heart, and one that wears it on its sleeve at that. The empathy is overflowing. There is such celebration of the indomitable spirit of the Latin American immigrant, their success despite hardship. The Reyes family are supportive, sweet, loving and unashamed of their specific cultural identity. Apparently James Gunn did not have a huge amount of input on this, but this does work well as a lead in to his handling, aka the DCU: it cares deeply about its characters and ensures you do as well, there are great needle drops, and it really makes you care about someone that a lot of people currently do not.I would say about a third of the quick fire jokes should have been trimmed out. There are times where it really feels like they're jingling keys in your face. The fairly frequent, fun if not always the most creative action features a lot of CG, and though it's definitely better than the Flash and Ant-Man 3, it's especially helped by the fact that this was clearly shot on actual locations and physical sets, not surrounded by green screen screens or on the volume. They actually did toss a stunt person through the air, that car was actually knocked over, etc.Some of the violence in this really pushes the PG-13, and though there's not a huge amount of moderate to strong language in English, note that anyone speaking Spanish will pick up on some swearing there. I recommend this to any fan of comic books and the films adapting them. 7/10.","

"Garcwrites","16 August 2023","It became increasingly obvious that Blue Beetle was designed to be a fun family film with maybe the younger members of the family in mind. It's not quite a Spy Kids movie but it's close. A young adult version if you will. Don't get me wrong I love the Spy Kids movies for what they are and this movie made me think of them, but a grown-up version. Blue Beetle has heart, the emotion - I teared up a few times, - and the family dynamic is...great. It's a joyous movie that celebrates Latin culture well, but it falters when it comes to the superhero side of things, mainly the villain's goal and that he's fighting another version of himself.The violence and the softened but still gory on-screen deaths would be the things that make this Spy kids-like movie - to keep the previous example - more adult but it's the performances that make it so, except for one. Uncle Rudy was too much, he was in a low-budget Spy Kids movie, while the others weren't. It was so jarring. He was so grating for me that I was tensed whenever he was on screen, which was a lot. It's like he's trying to be the main character in this movie instead of the supporting. Not everything he says or does is cringe but enough to be worrying once the pattern was identified and there's two third of the movie to go. I don't know if it's the casting, the direction, or the script, maybe all three but Uncle Rudy was not it, not the secret sauce. He really brought this movie down for me. This role could have been played differently. He's being a caricature when the others are desperately trying not to be. I'm not hating on him but him being the main thing that doesn't quite work in the movie is pretty good in my book.Xolo, Bellissa, and Bruna really shine in this movie as do most of the Reyes family cast, they made me care about the family and what happens. Xolo is a great Jaime, I'm most familiar with the character from Young Justice but I recognized him in Xolo. Belissa as Jaime's sister was amazing, she seamlessly brought the dry humor and the sadness, she didn't lose me once. Bruna is a great find and this is probably the role that I'll recognize her from.Blue Beetle is entertaining and fun, a good time at the cinema, yet just shy of being great.@garcwrites.","

The family members got way too much camera time and to be honest, made me cringe. Boy turns into a blue suited super hero and flies through the roof - family start singing and dancing. The uncle character - SO ANNOYING.Grandma with a gun - stupid.Blue beatle being beaten to a pulp but refuses to use weapons or take down the villain.Walk into old mansion - press a single button on watch - secret trap door to secret hi tech head quarters. Just really silly.Oh look.an old bug ship we can use.

"rannynm","16 August 2023","I really love the film Blue Beetle! One thing I enjoy is the strong cultural theme at its center. It is a great sci-fi film, with a great tone and some pretty fun comedic scenes and characters, which is different for a DC movie.The storyline is set in Palmera City where Jamie Reyes (Xolo Maridueña), a Gotham pre-law graduate, is trying to get a job. When he meets Jenny Kord (Bruna Marqueszine), she gives him a piece of alien technology called the ""Scarab"" that gives him superpowers. The plot thickens when a woman named Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) tries to steal the Scarab back from Jamie, putting his entire family in danger.The storyline is great. What this story does differently than other superhero movies is make the main character's family a big part of the action. There are a lot of other unique things about this film, too. I love the way the director and writers bring representation of Latino culture into the film through the characters and the sets. Palmera City, Jamie's house and Jamie's family all feel very realistic. The costumes are incredible as well, especially the Blue Beetle suit-it's slick and has a personality of its own. Of all the characters, my favorite is Rudy (George Lopez), who brings a lot of fun into his scenes. He is the 'tech support' for Jamie, but is also a conspiracy theorist, and there are a lot of jokes based on his quirky personality. The makeup effects are great too; for example the scene where Jamie transforms into the Blue Beetle.The film's message is that family makes you stronger, not weaker, which is a theme I love. Be forewarned that the film has a few violent scenes, a lot of action, some profanity and sexual references.I give Blue Beetle 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases in theaters on August 18, 2023. By Connor S., KIDS FIRST!","

"maxwelloreocookie","20 August 2023","I REALLY wanted to like this movie, despite hearing a lot of people say it's mid or bad, and constantly hearing it's gunna bomb at the box office. Despite hearing all that constantly, I still tried to go in with a clear open-mind, and I was still disappointed.It's been said a million times before because it's true, but this is an EXTREMELY cliched super hero origin movie. The super cliched plot wouldn't be as bad if the characters and humor hit better, but that sadly isn't the case either.The humor for me just didn't hit whatsoever for me like 90percent of the time. Some of the humor is SUPER corny, and I generally don't mind corny humor, but the corny humor in this movie just takes it to a WHOLE Nother LEVEL! There's good corny and there's bad corny, this is bad corny, which doesn't even bring a little smirk on my face. The suspension of disbelief they pull just for a cheap unfunny joke is lowkey insulting.Xolo Mariduena is the best part of the movie, He's my second favorite character on Cobra Kai, the first being William Zabka. It's too bad Xolo was given a bad movie to work with, he's very charismatic and see great acting potential in him, but he just isn't given enough material to show that with this movie, could've made him funnier or at least give him a real arc. Jamie Reyes/Blue Beetle doesn't even have a real character arc. I guess his arc is he loves his family, then by the end, he still loves his family? Huh? I guess he has this super random thing that he's against killing, but I thought that was so dumb and unnecessary to include in the movie. Obviously killing innocent people is wrong, but killing people who are trying to kill innocent people isn't that bad. Plus after his anti-killing scene, it's barely ever mentioned again and this message really goes nowhere, so why was it ever mentioned in the first place? The movie would've been better if the ""no killing thing"" was just never bought up. And the no-killing thing just makes Xolo look like an idiot. The ""no killing"" message made sense in a movie like Terminator 2 for example because it's a huge part of the overall narrative of the movie, but here, it doesn't really do anything, so why is it here?The two main villains are super cliche,"" Your family is what makes you weak!"" Give me a break, seems like this movie was made for 10-year-olds. It's just SO BASIC and cliche that it's corny. Susan Sarandon completely phones in her role too, but I don't blame her because she is given nothing to work with. We all know Susan Saradon is a seasoned actor and clearly knows how to act, so she obviously chose not to even try in this movie, because she knows there is nothing to work with.The ""girlfriend"" is probably the worst actor in the movie. I supposed she's supposed to be the ""love interest?"" But huge quotations on that because she's really bland and has zero chemistry with Xolo. She's more like an AI exposition dump, and that's it.The action was overall just decent. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's barely just good either. It could've been way better, and Xolo barely used any cool stuff with the powers he has. This is not a spoiler because it's in the trailer, but he makes a Final Fantasy sword, this was kinda cool, but it seems random in the context of the movie. It would've been cooler and made more sense if the movie showed he was a big gamer or Final Fantasy fan earlier in the movie, and could've used other video-game weapons. And would've been kinda a cool, unique, and relatable thing for a young adult to do. But this movie only shows Mexicans liking stereotypical Mexican stuff, can't be more unique and show Mexicans liking other things like Final Fantasy, anime, or video-games in general.I'm just sad because we don't get a lot of Mexican superheroes, so they should've put way more effort into this movie if they wanted it to be successful, but they didn't. The lack of quality in the movie shows it. You just can't be super pro-diversity, then when finally get a chance to make a big-budget Hispanic movie, you made a below-mediocre mess of a movie. Whoever wrote and directed this movie just ruined it for more diversity movies in the future. And I know the writer and director of this movie are both Hispanic, so I don't get why didn't they try harder??!?!!?! They should've tried harder or the main studio should've hired writers and directors with more talent and/or cared more.I just wiki'd who directed and wrote this movie, and the director only has 2 movies before this I never heard of. They should've hired a way more experienced director. As for the writer, he DOESN'T even have a wiki page!!! WOW! So your telling me the studios hired some guy to write this movie has no prior movie writing experience or even show writing experience in his whole life?!?!?! Why was he hired?!?!? No wonder the writing is so bad, and I know there can still be studio inference as well, but we still deserved at least a competent writer for this movie.This was my last hope for the DC cuz 90percent of their movies are awful, and they recently keep just making flop after flop and it's easy to see why. It BLOWS MY MIND how one of the richest studios struggles to make a single good movie when they have WAY MORE resources than 90% of other movie companies. They can't even decide if this movie is part of the rebooted DCU or not. How about this, you'd never have to worry about rebooting your series in the first place if you just consistently made good movies like youre supposed to! Making good movies should ALWAYS be at the top of your list.","

"eoinageary","18 August 2023","So Blue Beetle is definitely fun, I'm not sure if it's as amazing as people are making it out to be but it's a fun movie and a solid introduction.The story is about Jaime ( Hi May ) who comes in contact with the Scarab and turns him into the Blue Beetle. His family are under threat as Cord Industries want the Scarab back, He must become one with the Blue Beetle and fight for his family and his freedom.The family element is really good, usually they say it's family oriented and there a joke or 2 but family is at the heart of the movie and the stand outs for me is NANNA the goat, a caring figure and a bada$$, the uncle is also great, he has some funny likes but his overall character works.Blue Beetle himself is really enjoyable, the movie is fine to be honest it's an origin story. Not man of those are AMAZING but his personality and likeness pulls the movie. Good action scenes and I love the suit, overall a good movie definitely worth watching and I'm looking forward to more Jamie. 2 post credits, the end one not worth it, it's a joke hahah 7.5/10.","

"shovon-1","4 November 2023","What was this movie actually about? Mexican immigrants and their sob story in the United States? I just could not grasp WB's plot here at all. Was I watching a superhero movie or a mash-up of Power Rangers mixed with Bollywood emotions among a group of Spanish-speaking immigrant people who think doing education brings you in debt ? I was completely alienated from the plot, story, and the general content. If immigration sob stories are what WB wants to delve into, they might as well make a documentary rather than enticing potential customers with this worthless content. My two hours, or whatever, lost into a worthless oblivion.","

"HernanTrujillo","20 December 2023","As a Latino myself, I was looking forward to this film but, I was unfortunately disappointed. I was excited to hear that we had a superhero movie starring a Latino cast coming into the works but, it was executed poorly. There are times when they were trying too hard to portray a Latino family, a bit exaggerated and tried too hard to be funny. The acting from a few of the cast was fine, some of it felt forced. It seems like they didn't put as much heart into this film as they would a Batman film. With some work, this could've been a better viewing experience. Xolo was a great casting choice but could use a bit of work on some of his execution to the character.","

"TomTalksFilms","20 August 2023","Another day and another superhero film graces the big screen. This time it's DC with a film that feels like a cheap spider-man rip off without any of the interesting bits.Xolo Mariduena plays a young Mexican guy who's just returning home to his family after becoming the first of his family to graduate from college. Like many of us he finds himself jobless and it debt and now the pressures on as the rent for the family home is about to be tripled. What follows is a story about how a guy who's down on his luck mistakenly unleashes the power of the blue beetle and as we all know with great power comes great responsibility which is a quote that maybe Hollywood execs need to start putting into practice with how they treat their writers.The film is about as formulaic as it could be with every single Mexican stereotype forced in there often in the form of jokes that rarely land. I appreciate seeing diversity in my films but Mexican please let me know are you happy with how you're being represented because I wouldn't be if I were you?The films tone doesn't even feel like that of a DC film it's strangely light hearted to the point where it at times feels like a parody of a superhero film. This becomes an even bigger issue when the film throws in some emotional scenes as they have no affect on an audience as they feel so out of place with the light hearted nature of the rest of the film.I tried to stick with this one for as long as I could and there was a scene in the middle between the main character and his uncle (who by the way is by far the best character) where I felt the film may be about to pick up. This wasn't however the case and for the last 45 minutes I found myself on my phone and I can't say I've been this bored with a film since Ant Man Quantumania. Whilst I know this film isn't apart of the new phase of DC I do worry what may happen to the state of their productions in the hands of James Gunn who has publicly defended this film.For me it's the worst film of the year so far.","

"klchu","20 August 2023","As a far of Blue Beetle from Young Justice we were excited to see this movie. For the most part this is a success and the movie has a good heart and cast. If you have ""super hero fatigue"" this movie won't help but it does change things up a little.First the weak points: Not the best villain, but at least a believable one. The pacing of the movie could also be a little tighter. There are a few scenes which probably should be been DVD extras.The strong points: A decent cast who all get meaningful things to do. The core messages are good, but perhaps not original. Still, well-done tropes are still enjoyable. The SPX are very good. Most of the suit is practical effects so they look real and there isn't CGI overload.This is definitely an ""upper tier"" DC superhero movie. I hope they make a sequel.","

"demonblade-37792","18 August 2023","This is a great way to start off Blue Beetle (2023)! The first impression is that it had good jokes that I laughed along with. The whole movie revolves around a comedy-action movie so there was plenty of jokes to go around with. The acting was great with everyone especially Jamie Reyes/Blue Beetle (Xolo Mariduena) making him a likable protagonist. George Lopez playing as Uncle Rudy was my favorite character because he was basically the comedian of the movie. It was glad to see him back on the big screen. The cinematography with the special effects and CGI was good of Blue Beetle himself and there was a lot of blue and purple color schemes going on. It was fresh to see an old DC character getting his own movie. Director Angel Manuel Soto does a great job of portraying Blue Beetle's origin story off to the world. Overall, Blue Beetle is great with its acting, jokes, and action. I would recommend watching it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","

"ifychukwuokafor","21 September 2023","There's no other way to put this but this movie has no business being in the cinema. An absolute waste of 2hrs with a storyline that would make B-rated movies look top tier. The dialogues appear forced and cliche. I can see why it went through development hell for years and I believe it should've remained so.The script felt like it was made for Nickelodeon but somehow managed to find its way to Warner Bros and don't get me started on the action scenes.What a joke.In all, Blue Beetle was set to flop from the beginning - From the cast to the scriptwriting to the obvious CGI, it stood no chance.I'd not recommend this unless you've got time to burn.","

"GhostFoxX","19 September 2023","Anyone who follows DC or even comics as a whole, knows how promising of a character Blue Beetle is in the comics-verse. Guy has been a featuring member of Teen Titans for decades, holding his own as one of the coolest drawn characters that has a very interesting backstory regarding an alien symbiote. The character had immense potential to be turned into a promising live-action film-series out of it. And frankly speaking, I think the cast choice was good as well - they could've pulled off the hype. The only thing that ruined this film, however, is the writing. It's terrible - felt so rushed and low-depth at some points that you'd feel like pausing to not continue watching anymore. CGI was bad for some parts too, but that can still be overlooked as most of it gets the job done quite well. But the writing, man, it's awful. DCU won't have much to build on if they continue doing such pathetic job at writing stories like this.","

"GusherPop","17 August 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is a new DC movie that follows the box office success of ""Shazam!"" and ""The Flash."" The film stars Xolo Maridueña as a young superhero and is rated PG-13. The film is inspired by Latin culture and follows the story of a 22-year-old Mexican college grad with a cool family. Director Ángel Manuel Soto's fantasy adventure is familiar to fans of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming,"" ""Black Panther,"" and ""Iron Man,"" but features a main character's superteam instead of Batman and Wonder Woman. Jaime Reyes returns to Palmera City after graduating with a degree but faces a difficult situation as his parents, Rocio and Alberto, have shut down their auto shop and are about to lose their house in a gentrified area. Jaime meets Jenny Kord, who volunteers to help him find a job. However, things take a strange turn when Jenny gives Jaime a blue scarab, a valuable piece of alien biotechnology. Jaime takes the bug out of its box, and the otherworldly entity chooses him as a host, giving him a supersuit and cool abilities. ""Blue Beetle"" takes a Spider-Man comic playbook approach, putting Jaime through the wringer with his new powers, accidentally cutting a bus full of people in half, and even going to space. Maridueña's performance in the learning-to-be-a-superhero scenes is likable, allowing viewers to understand Jaime's strengths and insecurities. The world begins to fall apart as Victoria seeks Jaime to remove alien tech from his body. Jaime's openness to love adds humor and young-adult hormones. DC has had some crummy supervillains in recent years, and Sarandon's antagonist is one of the better examples. Victoria wants the scarab to help her create a One Man Army Corps of souped-up soldiers, including Carapax, a character tied to the controversial real-life School of the Americas. Jaime takes Victoria on with the help of his family, including his Nana, sister Milagro, and Uncle Rudy. Jaime's loving relatives ground his story and add a key sense of representation. The film's plot is grounded in the love and loyalty of Jaime's family, making it a relatable and entertaining story. ""Blue Beetle"" is a comic book series that features Jaime's transformation into a body horror character, blending lively personalities with a deep comic book mythology. The story revolves around Jenny's missing dad Ted Kord, the previous Blue Beetle. As the DC universe undergoes changes, fans can expect more of Jaime in the upcoming reset, highlighting the ongoing flux in the character. ""Blue Beetle"" is a politically spry film that explores the ills of white-American imperialism through the love and loyalty of its characters. The villain, Victoria, is a metaphor for the past and present, while the hero, Love, triumphs over self-discovery. The film's comedy focuses on how these characters mesh, rather than low-hanging memeification, and the family-bound narrative is pure and pure. ""Blue Beetle"" is a superhero film by Soto that despite its unremarkable action sequences, it still maintains vigor due to an entertaining ensemble. Adriana Barraza delivers punchlines, while George Lopez as Uncle Rudy delivers animated pratfalls and one-liners. The film's strength comes from its family, making it an enriching experience at the movies. Although it may not break the mold, it does break expectations. ""Blue Beetle"" is a film directed by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, which focuses on convenience and convenience. The story revolves around Jenny stealing a blue scarab, which Victoria uses to develop super-soldiers. Jenny then smuggles it into Jaime's hands, who is unaware of the scarab. Jaime becomes symbiotically linked to the scarab and gets a blue suit. The film's weakest components are the inarticulate composition of the characters, with the villain Victoria being portrayed as a stoic henchman. The film also lacks chemistry between Jenny and Jaime, partly due to Marquezine's overacting and overacting. The film's plot is a mix of nonsensical events and smart beats, but it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling story.","

"MovieNinjaGuy","21 August 2023","I had low expectations of this film.I don't ask for much with movies, just for them to be mildly entertaining at minimum and have some heart. All the talk about bad CGI in the likes of The Flash I don't care about so much. I thought that particular movie was fine. Fun, had decent heart and some likeable characters scattered about who are at least trying to do things to move the story forwards.Blue Beetle however, is as bad as things can become I think when it comes to superhero movies. We have seen some terrible entries in the Marvel space recently as well with Thor 4, Dr Strange 2 and Black Panther 2 being very poor. Strange story choices, terrible villains and bad resolutions. In all 3 of those films the main super heroes are almost just background characters and no longer the focus.Blue Beetle is on that terrible level and this film makes even less sense I have to say and again the main superhero is relegated to be less important than he ought to be for some reason.Every character seems so unlikeable, except for the father. The sister talks about taking a big dump at her cleaning job after we first hear how the family struggles financially. Charming. The grandma ends up with a higher kill count than the super hero. The uncle is a computer wizard who drives a big truck but still can't help the family keep their home.This whole family, who can't make end's meet but who can do everything else when it suits the story just doesn't work in a superhero film. It is not convincing. Story wise I think it is fine/good if they can be there for support and guidance. But to physically take over I think is a crazy approach that doesn't land well at all, especially when the best person out of that bunch is the one who dies before all that takes off.After the father's death the family straight away uses all the abandoned (supposedly) Blue Beetle related gear as in a sort of kitted out ready to go endless Batcave supply. But then we also find out the original Blue Beetle host who that all belong to is still alive in the mid credits scene? Why are we doing any of this? It is all so dumb and never focuses on what the current Blue Beetle superhero could do for humanity.Susan Sarandon, as the baddie, phones in her performance to make things worse. An utterly pointless villain who has some vague mission to make her robot army more of a robot army with the Blue Beetle scarab thing.Furthermore, early on, we find out that the Blue Beetle suit / scarab that gets fused with our hero's body can actually run on auto pilot. So what is the reason to keep the host conscious in that case? The suit seems to make better decisions early on whilst the host succeeds in convincing it to stop it from killing baddies, who then when still alive cause his father's heart attack and death.Compare that badly thought out drivel to the excellent story in the original Superman movie where Superman can't save his father from a heart attack death. He has all these powers but couldn't do that. Reality sinks in and it makes him more determined. There is no such character arc here at all.I didn't like any of what was presented in Blue Beetle story wise or character wise. There isn't 1 thing I can tell you I liked.There have been far better small budget movies this year that should have enjoyed more popularity over this endless superhero nonsense in which we constantly have to put up with lower quality story telling and horrible characters. Some good films I saw recently this year that may have gone unnoticed are: Talk to Me & Sisu. If you're after a big movie go see Gran Turismo.Look for those and give this tripe a miss.It has not been a bad year for movies I think and this hopefully is as low as it can go cinema wise.","

"masonsaul","18 August 2023","Blue Beetle is a very generic comic book movie that doesn't do much that's new however thanks to a core focus on family and groundbreaking representation that informs and enhances every decision made it remains a really good comic book movie and definitely one of DC's better films from their recent output.Xolo Mariduena is charisma incarnate here, Jaime is so loveable and leads the film effortlessly. Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Elpida Carrillo, Belissa Escobedo and especially George Lopez are a great supporting cast with a believable heartwarming family dynamic.Susan Sarandon could've been a delightfully evil, scenery chewing villain but unfortunately she isn't given much and ends up being completely forgettable. Raoul Max Trujillo isn't much better until some very last minute flashbacks that do actually completely change the character for the better.Ángel Manuel Soto doesn't do a lot to bring his own style to this genre but any and all flourishes of blue neon are greatly appreciated and the hand to hand combat is really fun. The music by Bobby Krlic is one of the most unique superhero scores thanks to its synth style which works well for this character.","

"torgis","18 August 2023","I watched the trailer and thought it told the whole movie; corny and cookie cutter, nothing spectacular. I know there is a ton of bias going into this with people assuming DC this and Gunn that, but this movie was so much more enjoyable to watch than expected and I was pretty happy with it.Yes, there are a few phrases that feel forced and would fit into the cookie cutter superhero flick. However, that only really happened 2-3 times. The tech shown in the movie was so incredibly fun and the suit - AMAZING. The quality of that suit is what got me in the theatre in the first place and it did not disappoint.It was a really fun movie (without spoiling it), it was not a replication of another, it had some fun characters (and one or two I wasn't a fan of, some moments of not great acting, but it wasn't a massive budget to begin with). Actually teared up at one point (okay, maybe 2).The best way to enjoy this movie is to get out of your own head with the expectations and inter-connectivity of the films and weird sensitivities. I saw another review mentioning the ""fascist"" comment - as a big fan of the character referenced, I still laughed out loud hearing it because it fits the wild energy of the character that said it (clearly intended as a joke). There's no secret agenda, it's a fun movie for a more obscure character, and I had a blast watching it. Went in thinking it wasn't going to be worth the money, but was pleasantly surprised and look forward to watching it again.","

"namob-43673","18 August 2023","One of the best from DC and kinda endearing. This is cute-ish, and if this movie had came out 25 years ago we would probably be pretty happy with it. But this is a C-movie, and it does not cut it today, and being cute is not enough to win over viewers.I have not liked a single one of the DC movies. Not even one. A couple of them have been watchable if you have had a few, and this is in that same general area of ""entertainment"". If you'd been gobbling down a 6-pack and a couple of shots, and you have a soft spot for cheesy cliche 1990s superhero movies than you might enjoy this. If you want quality, originality, good writing, good CGi and other things that make a good movie than this is not for you.There are a few cool moments, a few laughs, a couple of scenes which is good, and the music score is pretty nice. But other than that this is simple, perhaps something cute, something old-timey flashback but also so cliche so you know what is going to happen from start to finish, but yea, so what? You have seen this a million times, why not a million and one time? You could actually do worse. So if you are a big fan of the character, you might even find this to be good or great.I give this a very generous 4/10. Which I believe is the second highest I have given to the DC movies. And the reason is I do not think I wasted my money. Despite the score this is endearing and cute and sort of fun. But anyone claiming this is a good movie is delusional. This does not suck, but it does stink and you should be aware.","

"claszdsburrogato","7 November 2023","DC has not been having a good year with the films released in 2023. Blue Beetle is everything we've seen before, further reinforcing this tired and repetitive formula. This film again falls into the line of mediocrity, making it forgettable. The whole look of the film doesn't please me, it's sickening to see these extravagant lights and this soulless technology. The humor is forced in many moments and apparently the script doesn't realize this. They repeat the same jokes all the time trying to get at least one laugh, it seems like they try to make the joke stand out, but it's just unbearable every time it occurs. It's unbearable having to talk all the time about films like Blue Beetle. It doesn't deliver anything new or striking, not even striking in a bad way. The only thing that can be taken away from two hours of film is the Latin representation, which is indeed important, but at certain moments they manage to force even that, returning to stereotypes.","

"theffachrif","25 September 2023","Directed by Angel Manuel Soto, the story follows Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) as he searches to find purpose in the world after just graduated from college, but suddenly life throws a curve ball when he unexpectedly finds himself in possession of an ancient relic of alien biotechnology: the Scarab. When the Scarab chooses Jaime to be its host, he is bestowed with an incredible range of superpowers and weaponry.I get it, resetting what is already a risky and messy cinematic universe is a risky move, especially since opening it by introducing a quite unpopular character for the wider audience. But man I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't enjoy this one, it's a fresh and solid start if not a great one. It's slick, fun, and packed with emotions, while this type of origin story isn't new in the superhero genre but there's something special about Blue Beetle's central plotline. It's about the power of family's love and support also acceptance of what destiny has given to us, sometimes it doesn't meet our expectations, and sometimes it's exceeded it more than we can imagine. We can see it from Jamie's character developed throughout the story, actually not just him but also his family. Life after college isn't what he's imagined, Jamie even said he failed the family and it just gets worse when the scarab chooses him. He couldn't grasp the reality of it at first, but he slowly embraced it, Jamie is destined to be their hero, to be bigger than he had hoped for.I never see Maridueña's prior work, but he's certainly the right guy for the role. He delivers a joyful and honest performance, not to mention the rest of the cast who played the family, their chemistry natural and strong. George Lopez' Uncle Rudy is probably my second favorite, The dude is literally a comic relief. I'm not a big fan of the villains in this movie, there's nothing really special other than they play an important part in the story, obviously. I think they are sort of merely a threat, Susan Sarandon's performance isn't bad though. It's crazy that the CGI is way better and cleaner than The Flash, which has more budget than this movie. Both of the suits are practical but, once again, the Blue Beetle is definitely superior. The first suit-up looks terrifyingly awesome.Blue Beetle is a promising start for the DCU.","

"rgkarim","19 August 2023","LIKES:The Music:
-A simple like for some, the music has a bit of a mixture that is fun, toe tapping, and representative of the moment.-Hispanic raps and ballads have melodrama and that spice at moments with their catchy beats and vocals.-Other songs are that hip hop attitude that comes at the perfect moment to go with the impressive action and training moments. Really pushing the boundaries
-And the symphony songs are quite impressive when they come out in key moments.The Comedy:
-A big selling point, Blue Beetle is a lot of slapstick and jokes that might get excessive for some.-If you are Hispanic and have the relevance, it makes the comedy even better, as the cultural references are a deck of cards lined to be a winning hand.-While others are less specific, with great execution, timing, and quirkiness that I had fun with when it all came together.-And those who like uncoordinated tripping, stumbling, and accident prone comedy work to help raise the torch.-While not the most unique, it works for a comic book movie and has a place with a lot of other elements in this movie.The Story:
-The movie works to add elements that are good for an origin movie trying to reset a big universe.-We have a character arc, some tragic events to put pressure to meet them, a few representable villains, and the growing pains coming with the new power.-It has enough of these elements to blend mostly well, and I enjoyed a lot of the building this movie did with elements that have emotion, growth, and fire that I want in these movies.-And throw everything together within two hours to give you a concise story that is not too convoluted or thought provoking.The Acting:
-It's a comic book movie, and though we have seen monuments to the acting trade in some other films worthy of pedestal raising.-This movie is not bad, in fact good, for what I call the standard way of comic book movies, with a cast that is likeable, feels like a family, and has a bit more realistic feel.-Becky G's voice is not so much singing, and her new interaction as the Beetle's brain is funny, robotic, and near the end shows elements similar to Jarvis.-Bruna Marquezine has a commanding prowess to her. A balanced array of strength and vulnerability, matched with a real character that works well with the various groups she has to be with.-And Xolo Mariduena the lead is sensational. He's funny, charming, delivers his awkward young adult lines well, but grows into some more engaging moments that match the early days of Marvel and D. C. movies.-And George Lopez is... well Lopez. He works as both comedic relief and a good plot device, which might be annoying and old cad to some, but again holds merit in this movie and build up.The Effects... to some degree:
-The effects are what you expect in this movie, and DC continues to put out some impressive moments that worked for me.-Seeing the Blue Beetle fly, alongside his fighting mechanics was good for CGI to most degrees.-Fluid animation, good shifting changes using hard light technology, and a few other things that made the currently impossible, possible.-And with explosions and fires having some practical effects helps further blending of the worlds make it a little easier on the fakeness.The Action:
-It's a little meager to start with as the suit gets time to adjust, but once it does... I was happy.-Blue Beetle has several varieties of action to it, utilizing the start of the abilities and adding a little strategy to the mix up.-Impressive blasting, some good choreography, and helping add a little physical combat offered some mix up to the moments, and with the other things mentioned work to craft a comic worthy battle.-Good cinema alongside adding story elements to it only further enhanced the experience for me, and made most of the fighting in the small time.DISLIKES:The Comedy a Tad Excessive:
-If you have a high tolerance or an attitude of never enough comedy, you'll have no beef with this category.-For me, there are times where the emotional moments and developments are overtaken by another Spanish driven rant, or another screaming bout.-It gets a little tiresome to hear Lopez cry and scream at every other word of his, but it's not the worst compared to some of the other movies I've seen with overutilization.Predictable Story:
-I know that originality is tough to acquire these days, but this movie was very easy to guess what was happening.-Foreshadowing paints an obvious direction this film is going and it takes some of the twists and surprise that you might want in a film like this and an edge.-It all ties up about as I expected, and I think could be part of the boring part that people talk about in their reviews.The Visuals Dip Into Mediocre At Times
-I know this isn't meant to be the most realistic of movies, but Blue Beetle does things well for the most part.-However, there are times that the movie sort of dips in the frame rates and smoothness and gets lost in the hokey fake tones.-Blue Beetle has some polishing to do if they get the okay for a second movie. Maybe a little more blending of the real and the CGI to help blend things. Alongside some better depth and details.-Again, it's not as big for me for most of the movie, but there are some times where post editing was a tad too inconsistent.More Action At The End With Other Characters:
-There is a part where the movie is about planning out the final battle well and using the players.-They kind of do this, but it's underwhelming and used more comedically than that cool finesse to the grand finale.-Blue Beetle picks up the slack, but everyone else is kind of a waste when the potential was there to soar or fly like the character.-Given some of the fun aspects they were going to look at, but then just dropped or ran out of time or creativity.-This happens a lot at the end with a lot of characters, and this might be the biggest dislike for me that I hope will expand in the next attempt at the DC universe.The VERDICT:
Blue Beetle is the supposed start to the Gunn universe, and I had a lot of fun with the movie. It's nothing spectacular, mind blowing, earth shattering, or really sand out like they were int eh past, but that doesn't mean it's a throw away movie for me. The film works well with comedy, origin story, and characters, to make an entertaining build of the world and just focusing on the movie itself. While there are hints at what is to come, the movie is trying to just be a comic book come to life, and bring the punches that comics can only do with a good imagination. And the way they utilize references, technology, and action that I really enjoyed and would have liked a little more of. Yet, the movie is indeed predictable in story terms, a tad excessive at times, and needs some polishing to really hit a consistent B and A gam. Blue Beetle may not be the redefining piece many are still looking for, but it was still a fun incursion with enough gusto to dip into the movie theater.

"sherjan-aamir","17 August 2023","Blue Beetle works well for what it is trying to be, a fun time a the movies that you won't be thinking about once you leave but during the time you're watching it, it'll keep you engaged and entertained for its runtime. The family dynamic works wonderfully and while a few moments can be a bit on the ""childish humour"", most of it came off as charming to me. In tone, it's the closest to the first Shazam film and a similar degree in quality as well. The suit looks great, the fight scenes are cool and the story is unfortunately, generic. The niche fanbase of Blue Beetle will definitely enjoy this one as it is one of the better DC heroes debut and a much big screen debut than a certain other, much popular hero dressed in red who runs fast. If you'd have told me a few years earlier that I'd have a significant better time with this than a Flash film, I would have called you crazy but here we are...","

"josephbarros-16407","6 September 2023","Here we are the first movie in Gunns supposed Reboot and DCU and in fine fashion just like his The Suicide Squad Movie its flopping and sinking faster than the titanic.I tried to give this movie a shot I really did but its terrible and generic to the point they even tried to play the ethnic card and it has completely fallen flat on its face.On the good side atleast the special fx were an improvement.....atleast compared to the flash but come on the DC property since 2017 from its managment and choices has been low par.The movies since 2017 Josstice League onwards have floundered and completely imploded, but hey thats what happens when a studio decided to listen to critics and haters and then started making the movies for those types of people, you get a mess, you get flops, you get mediocre, you get generic and pointless movies.I have no interest in Gunns DCU because if its anything like this then it is over before its started, think I will download his movies because I sure aint going to pay to see them after how the studio treated the actors, directors and its fans for almost a decade.James Gunn good luck with Superman Legacy because even that sounds like another retread of the flop Superman Returns 2006 all over again, gunn your going to very much and seriously need it.","

"mesho_","16 August 2023","Everything about this movie is so clichéd and generic.And for a 2023 movie, it looks so average. And I can't believe Oppenheimer's production budget was less than this trash by 20m!.Mediocre acting , awful writing , laughable villain. Couldn't you try something different for the villain's motive?I think the end for the superhero movies becomes more clear with every new installment.I'm not asking for you to make a masterpiece but atleast show me that you are trying to provide a work that stands the test of time, I went to watch The Dark Knight just after I finished watching this trash and the difference is absolutely laughable tdk has better visuals and it came out 15 years ago! ( and the marketing of dc claims that their movies are the best since tdk with every movie they release)From this stage I will stop watching any new dc project until I hear something good about it.","

"LordJiggy","20 August 2023","A real disappointment. The creators had a ""message"" they wanted to hammer home, and there was this mildly interesting story they decided to hide the propaganda in.The execution had promise, especially with the excellent reactions of the lead actor to being the unwitting/unwilling recipient of a forced integration with the alien life form (think...a nicer version of ""Venom"").Lots of laughs there, but they kept hammering the propaganda into any gap in the CGI action. You know, all the evul white peoples keeping the saintly People of Color down. Because all the people of color were either unappreciated (and unexplained) geniuses, Saints-in-Training, or the Oppressed with Hearts of Gold. Meanwhile the forces of Darkness were part of the white power structure that owned the courts and the police, and were even (SURPRISE SPOILER!) responsible for creating the villain's henchmen.Who could have seen that coming?Man, it was stupid. To say nothing of how the dipshit uncle character (a fitfully funny George Lopez, when the script allowed it) could control an aging superhero's all purposed vehicle just because he was another one of the story's ""Magical Latinos"" and the writers/director were too stupid or lazy to come up with even a minimally logical reason to explain why.Also, the Hero/villian CGI designs owed a LOT to Transformers...they should really cut Michael Bay a check for his stolen creative input.","

"isabellacheng","4 December 2023","Why, why is everybody yelling all the time? The dialogue so cheesy, the plot so flimsy. Never was I so annoyed watching a movie I actively wished all the characters to die a painful death. Perhaps except the father and Jenny. Oops. Heck, the mystery of Jenny's dad, who was never shown on screen, was more enticing than the premise of the whole movie.Dude, your boss at a weapon's tech company gave you an important box when the company was entering lockdown, told you explicitly not to open it, not to touch it. You opened it, understood that it was indeed something important despite the box's unassuming appearance, and went ahead to play around with it anyway. What the heck?And so much for insisting ""no killing"" in the first half of the movie, which led to the protagonist annoyingly becoming a punch bag who won't even defend himself. The movie ended with a massacre of the ""bad guys"" while his family was visibly enjoying themselves while doing do. Oh yeah, and there's one last ""no killing"" at the end, which led to the whole island blowing up. What even is the point of all these?I started out giving this a 5/10. Then progressively downgrade it to 4 then 3 and then 2. What a load of dung.You get it? Dung beetle?Still more relevant a joke than the beetle fart gag in the movie.","

"alryanjayvillamor","18 September 2023","Doesn't mean the director is Mexican she is needed for the job. The director has just made 1 movie and that's it! What is DC thinking???All about the family but really unnecessary! Aiding him to battle is a no no! Especially that grandma oh my goodness! Plus having Ted's daughter introduced when she is non-existent in the comics is a bad move too. They should rather have Ted instead to mentor Jaime. And maybe, just maybe we get to see a Blue & Gold movie which will suck coz Gunn is running the show.Khaji-da is not a female TF! Also, that scarab at his back is waaaaay to BIG! Don't get me started on OMAC! Isn't he a hero? And got his powers from Brother Eye made by Bruce Wayne? And he's a cyborg too not a human transforming into a war machine!It was an ok movie. It does not deserve a higher ranking above 6. Maybe a flat 6. Or 5!","

"AreSee5454","28 December 2023","One of the biggest question in the movie - Why did the scarab chose Jaime? - is never answered. And IMO, makes the movie even worst for it.Why does it make the movie worst?The scarab didn't chose Ted Kord, a man who was very intelligent (I'm assuming since he built all those futuristic technology) and was altruistic (fighting crime even without superpowers).But instead chooses Jaime, why? Because he is...naive? He doesn't want to hurt people with a deadly weapon but doesn't think that people being smashing into objects in high speed aren't going to die due to brain hemorrhage or internal bleeding?Unathletic? The guy barely has any muscle tone; at least Andrew Garfield was cut for The Amazing Spiderman.Weak-minded? Khaji-Da did 90% of all the fighting!!!The only reason I can use as a rational on why the scarab would choose Jaime was because of the latter. She could control and eventually overtake Jaime's body and mind because he was weak.Even Jenny would be more ""worthy"" of the scarab over Jaime.Pros:
+ Bruna Marquezine - sorry, but having some eye helped with the stupidity. However, her exaggerated man-spread when introducing her character was not attractive.Con: (outside of what others have already brought up)
Weapon tech company uses simple guns to fight? Even the fortified island didn't have any weapons for a possible sea or air assault.Carapax fight better with a less overpowering suit?Poor family losing their home all have the newest iPhones, a (poor taste) tricked-out Yota, and expensive taste for shoes. It's funny thatthere are at least 4 abled working people in the house and they still can't pay the house bill?High tech company leaves the most important tech in its entire history alone in a room with no camera, security, or security measures. The same building doesn't up security and lets the building get infiltrated again because El Chapulin playing in the security camera is not too much of a concern to lock down the entire building. But then again, when they did lockdown the building the first time in the beginning they allowed all sorts of people to leave willy-nilly.","

Whoever tried to write the humor for this movie should stop writing and apply at Walmart or something they are capable of. The plot is dumb, the decisions by characters are idiotic, the movie is full of cliches and familiar tropes and this was an awful representation of Latinos. The death knell for superhero movies is almost complete. DC should just focus on the Peacemaker series and never make another film. This won't bode well for more minority driven blockbusters, that's for sure.","

"Jithindurden","20 August 2023","A very generic superhero movie because of how many of these have been coming out and yet it manages to be a fun one with some nice touches in it. The Mexican-American culture feels properly ingrained into it and the comedy works out well because of the heart in it. The lead actor was pretty charming and his family was also really lovely in their roles. The Blue Beetle suit looks incredible because it's mostly an actual suit rather than complete CGI and the hand-to-hand action looks really nifty. The director knows how to properly compose scenes, with proper length in drama and action without chopping them up. But still, the movie is a pretty straightforward superhero origin story with only a few bits and pieces of freshness in it and some tried and tired cliches. Overall, this is only for those who really enjoy superhero films in general. With the superhero fatigue, it's no wonder there were only like 10 people in the theater.","

In the thrall of the Scarab, Jaime starts screaming. And screaming. And screaming. Screaming as it rockets him through the roof of his house into the stratosphere. Screaming through city streets. Screaming as he cuts a bus in half in a ground-level flyby.Screaming too at his transformation are the members of his family. Much, much screaming.Screaming while fighting, screaming that he does not want to fight, screaming family, this movie should have been called ""The Screamers""...And I don't even get to the many non sense, like Blue Beetle doesn't want to kill. But the Uncle is willing to stab people with the bug mobile legs. Grandma machine guns down security guards just doing their job.","

"lhmcm","18 December 2023","Blue beetle got some good reviews, and it had some potential. But it was wasted. The script is bland - a mess of lazy jokes and old tropes we're tired of seeing. There's not very much that sets it apart from other superhero movies. It's dull and cliche.Some of the members of the main family are likable enough, and the death of the father is very emotional, but it's just difficult to care about any of the characters. The leading villain is boring, although her henchman is given a tragic story that makes him the best part of the movie.The action sequences are decently entertaining, but many of the protagonist's exclamations during them just make them annoying. The CGI is also terrible. Blue beetle isn't a boring full, but it's a lackluster one and I wouldn't recommend it.","

"shaikhirshad-41223","18 August 2023","Blue Beetle is said to be one of the best DC Family film this year. This movie has everything store for the audience. From Superhero fans to the general family audience all can enjoy this film with a happy face. Movie tells us about the Blue Beetle origin of how a boy from a middle class family gets consulted by a scarab and what situation does he face after getting that scarab into his life.The best thing about this film is it does not focus only on one character and the situation what he face but the whole family gets stucked into it and how they deal with that situation. Family Reunion and the way director has shown the Reyes family was one of the highlight of the film. The origin story doesn't hit you very much as it has same old vibe of origin superhero movies and sometimes you'll also remind some of the comic origin movies that are similar to this film.CGI & Action Sequences are top notch and specially the suit design looks cool and Whenever the suit uses it's different techs while fighting is a treat to watch with perfect cgi elements. XOLO has shined throughout the film and gave the character full justice so as the rest of the cast with acting performance too. Villain is one of the major problem of the superhero films and this film also faces the same issues because it doesn't show or the story justifies the strong villain character and at the end movie becomes average with old typical ending.All n all it's a fresh origin story with amazing cgi shots and action sequences plus a family drama with good acting performances which you can definitely enjoy and give this film a One time watch...","

But it got political when it talked about the plight of the poor and Hispanic opposition which was a bit frustrating.Spoilers ahead...They talked about losing their house when Uncle Rudy drove a $60,000.00 truck and had some high tech toys. Ummm could have made bills. Mom, grandma and daughter could have been working? I found that off. I mean, they could have even moved. I was annoyed by that plot narrative.They could have done without the patriarch dying in the plot. He could have been in the hospital recovering and that's where they decided to get Jaime.The dream sequence could have Jaime meeting Ted and Ted saying take care my daughter and done tricks about defeating his sister. That would have been better and nicer.Overall, as an adult, I was bored. But my kids enjoyed it a lot. But they were at the same understanding as me about the whole losing the house thing. They didn't get it either. My family understands hustle to make bills so they though the sister was being lazy.","

"claudio_carvalho","30 October 2023","After graduating in the law school, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns to Palmera City to meet his family, and soon he learns that they are broken and evicted from their home. His sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) gets a cleaning job for him at the mansion of the wealthy Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). However, they are both fired by Victoria when Jaime interferes in a discussion between Victoria and her niece Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine). When Jaime is leaving the house, Jenny asks him to look for her in the Kord Tower for a job opportunity. On the next morning, Jenny learns that her aunt is using an ancient alien Scarab to develop powerful weapons and she steals the artifact. Meanwhile, Jaime is looking for her to get a job, and she uses him to leave the Tower with the scarab hidden in a burger to-go box. His curious Mexican family opens the box and Jaime becomes the host of the alien scarab and they fuse in a powerful weapon. Jaime looks for Jenny to have explanations but he turns into the Blue Beetle. She tells him that they have to remove the device as soon as possible; otherwise, the fusion will be permanent.I had expectations to see ""Blue Beatle"" mainly because of the Brazilian actress Bruna Marquezine in a lead role. However, the film is a great disappointment, with a terrible and long screenplay about another unknown superhero. The silly and ridiculous Mexican family spoils the whole movie with their foolish behavior. It is annoying to hear and see them, and it seems to be a critic to the behavior of Mexican families in particular, and Latin families in general, in a prejudicial view of the author. The humor does not work and it is unfunny actually. And based on the cliffhanger in the credits, it seems that the productors intend to make a sequel. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Besouro Azul"" (""Blue Beetle"")","

"kevin_robbins","20 August 2023","Blue Beetle (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters this afternoon. The storyline follows a young man who is returning home from college to find his family struggling. He hopes to use his degree to make enough money to bail out his family. He bumps into a millionaire board member while in the process of losing his job and continues discussions after the interaction. They decide to meet up; and in doing sow, the lady hands him a scarab she doesn't trust her company with. The scarab turns him into a super hero and this is the Blue Beetle Origin Story.This is directed by Angel Manuel Soto (Charm City King) and stars Xolo Maridueña (Cobra Kai), Bruna Marquezine (God Save the King), George Lopez (Balls of Fury), Susan Sarandon (Thelma & Luis), Damián Alcázar (Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian) and Belissa Escobedo (Hocus Pocus 2).This is a fantastic origin movie. The writing and storyline makes you care about every character in the family...and this movie is really about family at its heart. You genuinely are very invested in what happens to whom. The CGI is top notch and the action scenes are fantastic. Blue Beetle's super powers are well depicted and fun to watch in action. A few scenes reminded me of the video games Soul Caliber and Mortal Kombat. The ending is sad, triumphant and does bring hope. George Lopez is absolutely awesome in this picture and keeps a fun pace to the film with his brand of comedy. Susan Sarandon was also a solid villain.Overall, this is an entertaining origin story and worthwhile addition to the super hero genre. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.","

"jedediahwtf","19 August 2023","The Blue Beetle movie redefines the word ""cringe."" From its painfully cliché dialogue to its cringe-worthy attempts at humor, every scene makes you want to crawl under your seat. The wooden acting and lackluster special effects further cement its status as a cringe fest. The plot, if you can call it that, is a mishmash of tired superhero tropes and predictable twists. The forced romantic subplot is cringe incarnate, with zero chemistry between the leads. Even the costume design seems like a bad cosplay. In a sea of superhero hits, Blue Beetle manages to stand out as a cringe masterpiece that's more likely to induce eye rolls than applause.Dont even go to the movies wait for the digital release

There is really nothing good to say about about this movie. Neither the story is good nor the characters. Story as I mentioned is a bad mixture of the marvel movies and so are the characters and the actors.

Someone walked in on them and they acted like nothing happened. We haven't seen that one before, right?Oh and if the main character has a good relationship with the family, you probably don't know what will happen with them... Why you didn't even get close to guessing correctly! They get kidnapped by the bad guy! That's a new one, right?That's just two big points. It's just frustrating that writers haven't gotten past the 2000s when it comes to what makes the characters tick and stuff.Oh and Susan Sarandon... Boy oh boy.

His transformation feels like a horror movie transformation and the hero of course doesn't kill people (rolls eyes) but that rule doesn't apply to all the other good guys. They violently kill and make jokes about it. One of its biggest issues is how it is supposed to connect to the DC universe going forward. It doesn't do anything to answer any of those questions. Then there is the racial undertones that seem unnecessary and hurt the movie and again push the us vs them issue instead of trying to unite people. At least it was sort of subtle and could be missed.","

While it's great to have the world's first Hispanic super-hero, it's a shame it has to arrive via this s#!t film.From charmless characters to a convoluted storyline, the whole film just drags.The lead actor - Xolo - is completely uninspiring. Bruna completely lacks a personality. The sister comes across as a complete jerk. The others have the standard Hollywood superhero nothingness, just one dimensional fillers. Presumably they thought that the heavy emphasis on family etc would fill in the gaps, but yeah nah. Didn't at all.The director tries to infuse lots of synth music, but the film never pulls it off right. The plot is both standard and completely sucks. There's nothing new here, folks.Superhero movies saturate the cinemas, and while Marvel has a good run, the DCEU is trying to get started a decade too late. James Gunn might make okay movies, but I doubt he's up to the challenge that rebooting the DCEU will take.Skip it. You won't regret it.","

"Holt344","18 August 2023","Blue Beetle was directed by Angel Manuel Soto and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer. I expected this film to be focused on the family side and overall drama of Jaime Reyes' life, mostly because of the film Soto directed, Charm City Kings which was a film I loved. This is a superhero film for the entire family, with themes focusing on family but especially displacement, colonialism, and gentrification in terms of what the director said about the film's themes.For this film and Superhero, I don't have vast amount of knowledge of Blue Beetle except for some comics and especially the Young Justice show and Injustice 2, but this film made a great job at showing the character and hero for a new audience, hopefully even making him into a well known one.An alien scarab chooses college graduate Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the teenager with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary and unpredictable powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle.The film stars Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle alongside Bruna Marquezine, Adriana Barraza, Damián Alcázar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon, and George Lopez. Having seen Xolo Maridueña in Cobra Kai, I've seen both his capabilities of a dramatic actor and in action sequences, when he was cast in this role I was behind it 100%. Having now seen the film I think he's what makes it decent to good. The costume design was on point, especially the Blue Beetle costume. It's inspired by Young Justice and Injustice 2 along with other versions of the costume. Filming was done mainly at location and with heavy use of practical effects, such as the Blue Beetle suit. The director felt that the use of real-life locations allowed for the practical effects to be better integrated into the movie. Thus making it rely less on CGI and instead of what is best, practical effects. I really liked the action sequences, both how it was shot and edited. I think the film looks really good, great cinematography. I really liked the characters and actors playing them; Bruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord, Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord and Damián Alcázar as Alberto Reyes being three who impressed me.What Blue Beetle does extremely well is how they keep it family-focused and embraces the lore preceding this Blue Beetle, I'm of course talking about Ted Kord and Dan Garrett, the film also have a lot of heart. Critics found it to have plenty of humor and yes it does, but I felt most of the jokes fell flat because of how childish they were then again the majority of the audience was children when I saw it at the cinema. The highlight for me is Xolo Maridueña's magnetic performance in the title role, he's just terrific and does such a good job bringing the comic book character to life. The writer and director does too, a very fine bringing the story and origin to life. Blue Beetle is a fun little movie, using each million of its budget to good use, you kind of see why it was supposed to go straight to streaming as it looks quite cheap at times (mostly the antagonist and the visual effects to him, Raoul Max Trujillo as Ignacio Carapax / OMAC). But it's a good film, a good superhero film and worth your time.","

"Imshortok06","19 August 2023","Just saw ""Blue Beetle,"" and it was fantastic! I was pleasantly surprised. Coming in a little skeptical because DC has a few clunkers and feeling a little jaded from superhero movies, I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. ""Blue Beetle"" did what the best superhero movies do: focused on character development and people to root for. I LOVED the cast, from the kind-hearted dad, to the sarcastic sister, to the spunky grandma. The actor who plays the protagonist (love him in Cobra Kai) did such a great job in the lead role. Step aside, Fast and Furious franchise; THIS is how you incorporate a ""family"" theme into your movie. I laughed and I cried several times throughout. While some of the superhero elements have been done before, the blue beetle suit was pretty cool. The soundtrack was good, and Susan Sarandon did a great job as the villain. I have to say that this DC movie is by far better than many of its predecessors.","

"TxMike","4 December 2023","This is an origin story. Set in a fictitious city much of it looks like Los Angeles and the featured family is of Mexican ancestry. In one scene they even warn each other about being discovered as undocumented migrants. But I see much of it was also filmed in Georgia.The featured actor is 21-yr-old Xolo Maridueña as Jaime (hy-mee) Reyes, just returning home from college with a degree in Pre-Law. Through a chance encounter with a young lady who happens to be an heir to a wealthy company, he looks her up the next day as she is pilfering a scarab to keep it safe, out of the hands of those who want to use it for harmful purposes.But Jaime gets in the middle of it all, gets the scarab (about the size of a hand) and brings it home in a fast-food box, and is told ""do not open the box, do not touch the scarab.""Of course his crazy family, particularly his sister, violate that instruction immediately, the scarab jumps onto his face, eventually it gets inside him (via his butt-hole?) and quickly he is overwhelmed by powers he has no idea how to control or how to actually use.It is the origin story of a superhero, the Blue Beetle, but frankly it is done in such a silly manner at times, then in a manic style, that for most of its 2-hour running time I was laughing uncomfortably and waiting for a more meaningful story.I don't know why this was made, there really is nothing novel about it. Most of the ""featured"" reviews here are accurate. It is NOT a good movie and I certainly would NOT want to watch it again. At home, with my wife, on DVD from our public library.","

"panagiotis1993","21 September 2023","My Reaction / Review for Blue Beetle (2023): So Jaime's family is about to lose the house? That sucks. Jaime looks like a very humble guy, I like that. Wait so it was that easy to steal the scarab? Wow, the first time that the scarab connects to Jaime it looks like a freaking horror movie. Why did he have to cut that bus in half, the scarab could easily avoid it, that's very dangerous with so many people in it. The scenes where the scarab gets activated for the first time were pretty fun. Rudy is a bit too much, its like he is screaming for some reason in every scene. So the uncle has some super tech that messes with the electronics and cameras? How convenient.Also they go to Kord industries and there is no serucity or anything? That's dumb. Wait so Carapax has a scarab too or some other technology? First hour is decent, a 6.8/10 I would say, let's see if it gets better or worse. Wow there is no way to get rid of the scarab, its for life, that's kinda cool but at the same time it sucks. The dad is dead? Now its personal. Damn the dad's death made me emotional. Many times they talk in spanish, I would really appreciate some english subtitles but there are none... So now Rudy knows how to fly a spaceship? That's ridiculouus, this man can do anything the plot wants.So now the grandma joins the fight? Cant take this seriously. And now the grandma shot three soldiers, so cringey and ridiculous. The 2nd half is so bad so far. The villain(s) in this movie are so not interesting. OK here is my conclusion. The movie is not bad but it is not great. The whole family thing was too much at some point, the humor is mostly bad, the dialogue could be better, the action scenes mediocre. The only thing I liked was Jaime's character. Overall a mediocre movie, its also like you've seen everything before and very predictable. My final rating is a 6/10.","

"anyanimeotoho","10 September 2023","Blue Beetle does little to impress as far as superhero movies go. Now, we might decide to ""not take it seriously"" and just enjoy the film as a feel-good super-powered adventure, but we've gotten better movies of that nature.For example, DC's very own ""Shazam!"" Interestingly, both films make family a prominent theme in their plot and it proves to be a bankable choice once again. There is a beautiful family dynamic on display here that is hard to deny.The movie falls back on the protagonist's family for most of its comedic content too. However, more often than not, the jokes unfortunately don't land for me. They might come in the form of harmless antics and cheesy lines, but I don't think they really cater to a more mature audience due to their simplicity and lack of originality.The events in the film are equally unimpressive to me because of how recycled everything feels. We've seen too many elements of this story in other superhero movies, and so Blue Beetle's character starts to lose his uniqueness besides the suit (which we learn too little about). It makes me begin to question the point of telling this story.Thankfully, the visual and special effects in this film are one of its positives. The suits and tech on display are deliciously detailed and the fight scenes are choreographed quite well. It makes the action scenes really engaging.Summarily, I think Blue Beetle had the potential to be better. I don't know what the vision for the film was, but what we get is a bit underwhelming.","

"danchilton-71955","6 November 2023","The original DCEU utters it's last wheeze with Blue Beetle, a film with just about enough character to avoid being the most generic superhero movie of all time. Emphasis on just about.It really should be better than it is since it has plenty of elements that ought to add up to a fun super hero caper. The focus is on a whole family rather than yet another lone outsider, it puts a different culture front and centre and it leans (or at least tries to) into the bright and silly side of the genre. Unfortunately so many parts of the movie feel like they've been given the absolute minimal effort.The story sees Jamie Reyes return to his home city after graduating law school to find out his family are facing eviction. He takes a job with his sister at the mansion of an industrial CEO and promptly gets them both fired but ends up in possession of ""The Scarab"", an alien super weapon that is basically a sentient Iron Man suit. Naturally the evil corporation the suit was liberated from want it back and conflict ensues.Pretty much every part of the plot is as by the numbers as you can imagine. Evil corporation treading all over the little guy? Check. Said corporation's villainous goal is create an army of super soldiers? Check. Bad guy that's a colour swapped version of the main character? Check. Day saved by the power of family/friendship? Check. Its all here and not delivered with anywhere near enough finesse to excuse the cookie cutter nature of proceedings. The same ""it'll do"" approach is applied to dialogue and even the special effects, with jokes that pretty much never land and wildly inconsistent CGI.The acting ranges from not bad to, well, bad. At one end of the scale is Xolo Mariduena who despite having crumbs to work with in terms of character development manages to inject enough likability into Jamie that you don't want to see him get smeared across the floor, even with the insipid dialogue between him and the B-tech Friday AI that powers the Beetle suit. On the other end of the scale is a career low performance from Susan Sarandon as Victoria Kord. I'm not sure if she was asked to chew scenery but decided to try and play it more sinister or was told to be intimidating but decided to camp it up. Either way she falls completely flat somewhere between the two. Maybe she read the final script and simply couldn't be bothered. It's a pity since, with a bit fleshing out, her character could have been interesting given she has every right to feel scorned. As it stands the message from her character arc seems to be patriarchy is...good?The only thing saving Blue Beetle from the absolute dregs of the genre is the Reyes family. None of them are particularly complex but they are all enjoyable and give off a genuine sense of family togetherness that adds some heart to proceedings. They mostly all get a moment to shine but you feel the best version of this film would have found a way to put them more front and centre. There is one joke/twist involving the grandmother that just doesn't work at all. I can imagine the film makers pictured the audience rolling in the aisles but staring in bemusement is the more likely outcome.It really feels like Blue Beetle needed taking back to drawing board and rebuilt one more time but the studio just wanted to toss it out there so they could get on with starting their whole universe afresh.4 successful revolutions started by geriatric matriarchs out of 10.","

"miguelaferrer","20 August 2023","Blue Beetle could be the worst DCEU movie ever in par with The Flash. It's like two movies smashed together. One movie tries to show the new Blue Beetle origin while the second movie is based on George Lopez annoying comedy performance which gets old really quick. The whole movie makes a mockery of the Hispanic family portrayed as annoying and insufferable. I finished watching the whole movie in hopes of a positive spin but that never happened. Stay away from this movie. If interested in watching wait a few weeks, it will probably be on MAX soon enough.The villain in this movie is just there to fill the spot. Nothing special about it nor should you care for it since it has no effect in this movie.Nothing about this Blue Beetle movie is worth to talk about, celebrate or remember. STAY AWAY!","

"cahidi","9 October 2023","That's the more appropriate title for this movie, cause apparently the Blue Beetle isn't the Scarab. The one which crawled up Jaime's ass wasn't Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle was Jenny's Dad in his superhero form. False title if you ask me. The background story was uninteresting enough to pull the audience in. They should've shown more background on the Scarab. Where does it come from, what it actually is, what's its purpose. It'll give the audience more depth to tune in. The villain has created the bare minimum of threat to anyone to show any significance to be dealt with. So there's one more less reason to watch this movie. Usually Susan Sarandon delivers awesome performance either as an antagonist or protagonist. But in this movie, she kinda hovers around. But I understand that it wasn't her fault. She can only do so much with the script that's given to her. I feel bad for her. But alas, even with the negative reviews I've written, I still can't give it less than 6 stars. Cause at least it's more interesting than Black Widow. And I think the real Blue Beetle is coming in the next installment of this movie. I hope they'll do better next time. I'm giving it another star to give the writers some encouragement.","

"jenkinscammy","24 November 2023","So much wasted potential in this movie.The first 45 minutes are incredibly slow and filled with disjointed plot/character development. The theme of ""family values"" is crowbarred into nearly every scene, but the script does a poor job connecting the audience to the characters.Susan Sarandon gives a wooden performance as a one-dimensional baddie. George Lopez falls flat as the zany tech-wizard uncle. Xolo Maridueña and
Bruna Marquezine are capable actors and fun to watch, but lack chemistry.Even in the thick of the action, pace is erratic. Bad Hollywood action cliches abound. Rather than overcome obstacles through strength of character, the good guys seem fated to win as teenage girls are able to fight professional mercenaries as equals.Overall, Blue Beetle comes across as a money grab. It copies elements of family superhero films (e.g., Antman) but fails to capture the heart. It takes itself too seriously at all the wrong times. It's just bad entertainment - I literally could not watch it all in one sitting because it was so painful to sit through.","

The movie is an origin movie that isn't quite an origin story. It tries to be overly fun. At times it works. Other times it just falls flat. The acting is reason le but the script is lacking. Action sequences range from decent to subpar. It has become the standard for both DCU and MCU movies to achieve at best mediocrity in recent years. As with other movies this brings nothing new to the table. It relies on its special effects rather than a great storyline and script. Unfortunately for DC you just keep missing the mark.","

"danmccully","24 December 2023","I'll try not to spoil anything here. I understood that this was going to be Hispanic-centered, which is great. We have quite enough rich white dude heroes, thank you. I found a number of the good-guy characters to be irritating - cutesy but so silly, so irrational, (and so unbelievable?) that I didn't particularly care about them. Believability in a superhero movie? Yes, actually. Believe in the magic or technology, no. But you have to believe that a character could think, choose, and act realistically. This fails that test.Ultimately, this movie is about family and honing a functional team, which is my favorite part. I'll say, though, that Big Hero Six explored this trope much better, with much less cringe. Way, way too much cringe in this movie. Sorry.Meh.","

"divinalondon","6 October 2023","The individual responsible for churning out this abomination should seriously contemplate a career change, one that involves absolutely no association with the film industry whatsoever. Let's delve into this cinematic catastrophe, shall we? Brace yourself for a litany of lamentation as I dissect every wretched aspect of this atrocity.First and foremost, the plot is an exercise in abject mediocrity. It's as if the screenwriter took a nap halfway through and decided to just roll with the most insipid and uninspired narrative elements possible. The result? A plot so devoid of creativity that even the most dedicated fans of mind-numbing tedium would struggle to find any redeeming qualities.Now, let's talk about the characters - or should I say, the vapid caricatures that grace the screen. These characters are not just your run-of-the-mill dull; they are remarkably, unbelievably, and profoundly stupid. Their actions and decisions defy logic and common sense to such an extent that you'll find yourself questioning the very fabric of reality.The dialogues, if you can even call them that, are about as generic as a cardboard box. It's as if the scriptwriters employed a random word generator to craft the lines, resulting in exchanges so devoid of wit, depth, or originality that you'll be pining for the days of Shakespearean prose.And then we arrive at the acting. Oh, the acting. If you could even call it that. The performances in this travesty of cinema are so wretchedly poor that you'd be forgiven for thinking you stumbled upon a community theater production gone horribly wrong. It's as if the cast was instructed to channel their inner wooden planks, with every emotion delivered in a painfully forced and unconvincing manner.The only semblance of redemption in this cinematic abyss lies in the special effects. I suppose if you're the type of viewer who derives satisfaction from pretty lights and flashy explosions, then congratulations, you've found your silver lining. But even the special effects can't salvage this sinking ship; they merely serve as a shiny distraction from the underlying ineptitude.To liken the acting in this film to that of a ""cheap TV series"" would be an insult to the multitude of talented actors who grace the small screen. No, this is a level of performance that can only be equated to the most bottom-tier, bargain-bin productions, where thespian skills seem to be optional.The entire film feels like a mind-numbing descent into the depths of idiocy. It's as if the creators took inspiration from the lowest quality, brainless cartoons and decided to replicate that asinine formula on the big screen. As the film trudges on, it only becomes increasingly moronic, pushing the boundaries of absurdity and leaving the audience in a state of bewilderment.At some point during this cinematic train wreck, I found myself teetering on the precipice of anger. Yes, anger. Anger at the audacity of subjecting viewers to this festival of imbecility. It's a genuine affront to the intelligence of anyone unfortunate enough to have wasted precious minutes of their life on this abomination.I had such high hopes for ""Blue Beetle,"" but what a colossal letdown it turned out to be. In comparison to this travesty, even the most maligned entries in the DC film universe shine like beacons of cinematic excellence. This film isn't just bad; it's a new benchmark for cinematic incompetence, a testament to the depths to which a movie can sink in its quest to be utterly dreadful.","

It's too bad this movie will be caught up in this reboot storm that is the current DC Universe. Susan Surandon was hilarious as the villain.

"classicsoncall","26 November 2023","Blue Beetle a DC super-hero - seriously? Unless you're a comic book geek (like I once was), you probably never even heard of the character. Believe it or not, the original Blue Beetle was created in 1939!, appearing in Fox Comics, later owned by Charlton Comics. The character, along with all the other Charlton super-heroes were sold to DC in 1983. Which doesn't clarify much if you're not into that whole scene.So, it's not surprising that this flick is already streaming on MAX, just a short time after its theatrical release a little over three months ago (as I write this). I don't know if that's a record or not, but it does say something about the quality of the picture. Quite honestly, this can be a fun film for young teens, sort of a Spider-Man knockoff if you consider the number of 'legs' the character has when it transforms into the Blue Beetle. It's got that kid from 'Cobra Kai', Xolo Maridueña as the title character, so this could be a nice career bump for the young man with his talent and good looks. He's backed up by an almost entirely Hispanic cast, with an unrecognizable George Lopez portraying Jaime Reyes's (Maridueña) Uncle Rudy supplying the story's humorous moments. Adriana Barraza is a trip in the role of Jaime's Nana, though I did have to groan when she took up with that monstrous machine gun going up against the army of baddies.Although the post-credits scene suggests a sequel, I can't see filmmakers delving any further into the DC Comics B list of super-heroes, when even ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods"" and ""The Flash"" failed to set the box office on fire. Films like this one test even my patience in trying to be a super-hero movie completist, a sentiment that extends to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as DC.","

However, upon his return he discovers his family (his mother & father, sister, nana, and his conspiracy theorist Uncle Rudy) is going through a rough time financially, and facing eviction. So, rather than going back to school, he ops to find work so he can assist his family.While Jaime and his sister are working at a local resort, the lovely young Jenny Kord (whose family owns/operates ones of the largest corporations in world) catches his eye. After coming to her defense, and getting fired for his troubles, Jenny offers her number to him and how she may be able to get him a job with her family's company.So the next day, Jaime goes to see Jenny Kord to inquire about a possible job. When he finds her, she appears rather stressed/panicked, and upon seeing Jaime, she hands him a box, telling him that his first job is to guard the contents of the box with his life, and not to open it.Well,, these events lead Jaime Reyes down a path he, or his family, never saw coming.After seeing the trailer, and hearing bad reviews, I was very much prepared to not like this movie at all. However, I really enjoyed it! It is in no way perfect or groundbreaking, but it is a good, fun movie. Very much a departure for DC (it didn't really feel like
DC at all. At least not the one I'm used to. #restorethesnyderverse)Family is very much at the heart of the movie, and that's a really wonderful thing to see. The cast is really good (George Lopez plays the cooky Uncle really well and brings lols).There are cliches, and it is predictable, and there are some things said/eluded to that I didn't care for,, but all around it a fun ride, and I'd like to see a sequel.","

I think DC should just stop making movies, because frankly, they suck at it. Only Aquaman & Wonder Woman had any depth and angst and protagonists that made me care.

"a_sad_cow","18 October 2023","We've already had a fantastic Blue Beetle in the Young Justice series with so much character development and world development, neither of which were present in this film. What we did get as a lot of fancy CGI, lazy writing, and what should be an offensive quantity of stereotypes.One of the things that made Blue Beetle so interesting in Young Justice was both how overpowered/lethal the scarab was, and how fundamentally peaceful Jaime was. It's a fine line that this film thoroughly muddled at every opportunity. Cutting a bus in half that just so happens to result in no casualties before this dynamic is even set up? A ""systems check"" that needlessly endangers the host, just because it's fun to film? Magically rubber weapon to knock down soldiers at rocket speed? Mass effect weapons that happen to be completely non-lethal? A scarab that internalizes the importance of non-lethality just in time to stop Jaime from making a good kill?While there's nothing wrong with including cultural elements, it was blatantly obvious they were not only jam packing as many tropes as they could, but forcing them where they don't fit. For instance, it's perfectly reasonable to accidentally mispronounce ""Jaime"" when it's written, but does anyone ever repeat back ""Jamie"" when they're hearing the name for the first time? Does anyone in a suit ever get dismissed as a delivery driver for the color of their skin?How was Jaime becoming Blue Beetle something so crazy and foreign in one scene, and then cut to the lore of the previous Blue Beetle? Might we have introduced this backstory some other way than lazy dialogue walking through a room of old props?This movie is a complete waste of time and should not be watched by anyone for any reason. Feel free to reboot Blue Beetle immediately.","

"sathervbc","29 September 2023","This movie was an absolute disappointing pile of crap. Hollyweird at its finest shoving PC garbage down our throats. The plot is so simular to all other super hero films. It drags allt, the comedy is just plain and simple BLAH. George Lopez is just not funny. If this is part of Gunn's new DC reboot, then his other reboots will probably fail. The worst start to a reboot group of films. My wife, who is a native Spanish speaker thought this film was really really bad. I hope to hell there isn't a sequel. I don't have a problem with the actor choices, but even the dialog and acting was really bad.","

"eldiankyo","18 August 2023","This movie is waaaay below the expectations. Worse than Black Adam or Flash. The target audience is like boys between 8-11.Characters are boring, the main character/actor has zero charisma. Story is something that a beginner writer writes on an afternoon. Jokes are lame. The armor looks too much like Ironman, and the awkward reactions/interactions were borrowed from Spider-man/Deadpool. Warner management (after many failures) still thinks they can save money on writing the story, because it's super hero era in the cinema, and people automatically likes everything about super heroes.It's truly the time to say goodbye to the DCEU.Let's hope James Gunn and the AI will adapt the characters better, and write enjoyable stories in the next years.","

Lack of flashbacks: 7This movie is a giant mess and doesn't understand what it is trying to be or tell.The hero has a sister who constantly whines about how South American people have in hard in this city and how other people, likely White rich people, have it all and take it all no matter how hard these Mexican immigrants work so she doesn't even want to get an education or a proper job as it won't matter in her eyes. Yet the movie shows exactly why she is working low-paid jobs with no job prospects and her brother is working his way up. She uses a private bathroom then instead of trying to sneak herself out brags about her business while strolling out the stall catching the house owner, the evil lady, staring at her and firing her on the spot for being this dull headed. Anyone would have fired her here. She clearly shows she can't even follow basic rules or act civilized. And this type of behavior is constant from her so this one event just illustrated how she acts regularly. She's a racist hateful and extremely lazy uneducated worker. Her brother meanwhile just got this low-skill job and basically in what seems to be their first day gets a giant opportunity for getting a much better job in the company after being fired because of his sister. So a lead character got to explain her worldview with no one budding in and yet if you look at what is actually on screen it's the complete opposite. Yet there is never anyone to dispute any of the claims because the only White person here is the evil lady. They could have made this into some thematic debate yet she is just pure evil with no depth whatsoever.There is also a plot about how the giant tech company didn't make the evil lady CEO and instead made her brother CEO even though she ran it. The movie calls it out as sexist and tells this small story several times over. Yet from the very first scene she is made out to be an evil maniac who doesn't mind killing innocent people to get her way. She's nasty and evil to the bone and extremely open about this threatening people to their face just for fun. Apparently she turned evil after her brother got her job and then took over the job later on. But this is a hard sell. She was a great CEO then by not getting to keep her job turned into an extremely coldhearted murderer? This is an experience millions of people have in real life where they don't get their fair share. You get turned down or lose your job for unfair reasons all the time. Maybe even once every 5 years if you work in a competitive industry. If all those people turned into psychopaths we would have a huge problem. A more logical explanation would be that she was always pure evil and just hid this as she was gifted power from a young age because of nepotism and didn't need to step on toes. People saw this and replaced her and she clawed her way back. Actually, this would be a BETTER story. Instead everything is sexist or racist here. She experienced sexism and she is apparently racist. There is nothing deeper here.We also have the love interest literally cause a main death. An act that would make her hated forever in any real setting. Yet here they don't even mention it. Because obviously she's part of the good guys so her actions are therefore positive like in all other superhero movies. The movie doesn't care about what actually happens. It just forces a storyline into events that don't support this storyline whatsoever. It's like the writers didn't understand their own story which seems extremely common in modern movies that are largely produced. This trope scene is here, that trope scene is here. Step by step. Except they don't really create a storyline combined. Producers just selected them ahead of making the movie and forced a progressive immigrant theme onto everything and the writers just had to follow suit. Yet the themes are utter nonsense just forced into the movie via dialogue. It removes all depth and clearly this is why all actors phones it in.Everything here is extreme cringe. The acting is horrible and all dialogue is extremely on the nose in a way where even kids would notice this. Which is extra offensive as this is made for Latin Americans and other DC movies weren't this childish and silly. So they investigated the main market for this movie and figured out they had to make all characters constantly say what they were doing as they figured viewers wouldn't get it otherwise. Superhero movie viewers are not the smartest group of people overall, but this is made for people who don't even understand basic movie stories and have never seen a superhero movie before. So are Latin Americans in USA this clueless about basic superhero stuff? They have never seen a single superhero movie before?It's also extremely irritating how the lead does nothing. Everyone just pushes him around, but he's not even kind or smart. He's not even a clear weakling trying to stay safe. He's just nothing. He doesn't make any decisions and doesn't react or change things. His sister is bullying him because she's hateful and bigoted yet while they share parents he's completely different. They could at least have made him try to hide or avoid danger or responsibility like with Spiderman. Or made him into a regular guy trying to keep his life normal like with Clark Kent. Just some motivation in some direction even if it's something negative.The story overall is also nonsense even if we ignore the extremely cringe moral stuff. In one scene they need to break into a building and randomly we learn that a family member has made an extremely advanced system to shut down any security system anywhere even though this is an extremely advanced building with a room full of security guards controlling the IT security. We never learn why he knew all this extremely advanced IT stuff as an old guy or why he acts like a poor clown living with his brother when he is actually a genius. In another scene regular characters pick up weapons and become superheroes right away. Zero training. This is what modern movies do wrong. They always want to have some young girl also be a superhero and then create superheroes out of whole families. Which could work in some cases if they received training first and could die. If they are just like the main character superhero then obviously it means nothing. In another scene the main character has something extremely wrong with his body and needs to seek help right away. Yet his family is afraid of cops as they are illegal aliens. So they forbid him to seek help and freak out when he does. Again, this makes zero sense. He's 22. Why would they let him suffer and potentially die just to remain hidden? Are they psychopaths? He's an American citizen who just got his diploma yet suddenly he's not allowed to talk to doctors or people who may help? What?The movie looks and feels like a long episode of a dirt cheap TV show. But unfortunately TV shows have way better writing today. So besides the CGI being cheap and acting clearly all one-takes with no depth it doesn't even live up to a B tier TV show. Though I must admit some of the superhero TV shows are quite terrible. This is not just bad, this is unwatchable. And I am truly shocked that reviewers didn't notice the horrible acting and pathetic writing. Just watch the first 5 minutes. It's extremely clear this is not a good movie so how did people miss this?","

"jmstettner-83145","18 September 2023","Very few, except for older diehard Super Hero comics fans actually know who Blue Beetle is. He is not ""the melding of Ironman and Ant Man"" nor is he a smart mouth Gen Z. Blue Bettle is Ted Cord, an industrialist along the lines of Bruce Wayne, more than Tony Stark. He predates DC and was bought by DC from. Charlton Comics. Anyone who goes back to read the originals or his 1980s participation in Justice League will recognize the Watchmen character Owl who was based on Blue Beetle.Sadly, the trend in comics today is to present flawed people with powers rather than Heroes a reader can aspire to. This trend is given a nitro-burst in Hollywood where many supers are actually criminals such as Deadpool, Venom, Black Adam, Joker, Ant Man. It is part of the culture that wants to redefine (read obliterate) the notion of Hero under the guise of ""humanizing"" the character. To paraphrase The Incredibles (a truly underrated story), if no one is special, then everyone is.So it comes as no surprise that this version of Blue Beetle fails, because it offers nothing to lift the spirit of the viewer, nothing they can take with them as they leave the theater. Bruce Wayne comes out of the theater with his parents, having just seen Zorro, only to have them murdered. He idolizes the HERO he saw in Zorro and dedicates his life to fighting crime so no other child has to lose his parents. He is the Dark Knight who does not kill...until the 1980s when. Tim Burton gets his hands on him and devolves the character.You will probably enjoy Blue Beetle as the empty shell, devoid of any human value other than mindless entertainment. Sadly, we could do so much more.","

I thought the jokes were funny and well done, the Villain could've been better but I also liked the action and realism in the fact that it took him time to figure stuff out and he wasn't just awesome right out the gate it had a good range of emotions too.The script was decent, a little more character development would've helped but overall it was enjoyable and I think it makes for a great family movie night. Also the soundtrack was excellent and versatile. They put together an eclectic mix of Hispanic tunes new and old.","

"Anurag-Shetty","20 August 2023","Blue Beetle tells the story of Jaime Reyes(Xolo Mariduena). An extraterrestrial scarab chooses Jaime to be its symbiotic host, giving him superpowers that alters his life forever. Jaime becomes the superhero, known as Blue Beetle.Blue Beetle is a mind-blowing film. Director Angel Manuel Soto has given us a superhero movie that shines the spotlight on the titular character's family, while also giving us unlimited humor & heart. The action set pieces are phenomenal. The visual effects are perfect. The background score by Bobby Krlic is electrifying & unique, compared to the usual superhero movie background music. The performances are the standout of the film. Xolo Mariduena knocks it out of the park, as Jaime Reyes. Mariduena gives us another spectacular performance after his starring role in fan-favorite, Cobra Kai(2018-). Bruna Marquezine is outstanding as Jenny Kord. Becky G is effective as the voice of Khaji-Da. Susan Sarandon is fantastic as Victoria Kord. Belissa Escobedo is amazing as Milagro Reyes. George Lopez is hysterical as Rudy Reyes. Raoul Max Trujillo is awesome as Carapax. Damian Alcazar, Adriana Barraza & Elpidia Carrillo are excellent as Alberto Reyes, Nana Reyes & Rocio Reyes, respectively. Harvey Guillen is brilliant as Dr. Sanchez. Blue Beetle is a must watch (preferably in IMAX), for Blue Beetle & Xolo Mariduena fans. I'm so glad that James Gunn has decided to include Jaime, in his new DC Universe. Can't wait for future team-ups & sequels!","

"movieman6-413-929510","19 August 2023","Blue Beetle is a superhero action movie from Angel Manuel Soto, director of Twelve and La granja.Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns home to his family, but learns that a lot has changed during his college years at home and his family has deteriorated financially. To help his family, he looks for a job, which he tries to find at the wealthy company Kord Industries. Here he comes into contact with Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), who asks him to help her smuggle something out of the company.What Jaime smuggles out turns out to be an alien scarab, which Jaime chooses as a symbiotic host. This is how Jaime turns into the Blue Beetle. Now he must fight Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the boss of Ford Industries, who wanted to use the scarab for her own purpose. To counter the scarab, they try to threaten Jaime and his family, so Jaime as Blue Beetle now has to try to protect his family.This movie was first going to be released on the HBO Max streaming service, but they later decided to release the movie in cinemas anyway. It was also unclear whether this film still belongs to the old DC Extended Universe film series, or at least as the start of the new DC Universe film series, this film series would start. James Gunn, the new CEO of the DC film series, was also growing past this himself at first, but eventually decided that the film would meet as the first film of his new DC film series, because he still wanted to use the character of Blue Beetle at the front of this film series. Despite meeting then anyway for this new movie series, the movie remains much of a standalone with no real further references to other DC movies to come in the future. James Gunn can still remember that.Despite the uncertainty of which film series the film belongs to, the film itself remains a standard, standard superhero film, which does not bring much uniqueness. The movie is good about a Latino superhero, who carries this culture with him. This is something unique for a superhero movie.Furthermore, the film seems to copy more superhero moments from other superhero films. For connoisseurs of this kind of film, the film can come across as a bit unoriginal and it remains on a predictable side without creating real tension.The visual effects are also on the mediocre side with more of the quality you expect to see on a streaming service, which was also the idea for this film. For example, some of the effects appear less spread out.Xolo Maridueña tries to be the main character for as many days as possible, but this is sometimes made difficult for him by the standard quality of the film. Still, just as if he meets the early seasons of the TV series Cobra Kai, he knows how to portray a character that you as a viewer care about. Just like with Cobra Kai when the focus shifts to several different characters, he falls more into the background. Together with the castles, which his other relatives play, they still come across as a family with a Latino culture. Sometimes they just often try to do unnecessary things, while this is not always necessary. The villains in the film also come across as a bit standard as cliché villains from a superhero movie, who have no real good reasons for their evil plans.","

"Saint_Rinzler","20 November 2023","At some point, maybe Ragnarok, studios decided that humor had to play a major part in superhero movies. There were some fine actors in this film, a few of them had decent performances, but it's like a script was written and entire characters, their sole purpose being comic relief, were written in. Blue Beetle's sister actively took away from the plot with every scene she was in. George ""Batman is a fascist"" (an actual line he said in this movie) Lopez wasn't far off.It's a real shame too. Lately super hero movies have devolved from a heroes journey involving a chosen one, someone with special qualities, or someone who earned their superpowers into meh, this person will do, and this is no exception. The suit just kind of chose him because it wanted to.The actors deserved better.","

"cinistersynthicate","18 August 2023","Trying to be optimistic about the new DCU going into Blue Beetle I was hoping to see something a bit more fresh come from DC as whenever I saw this trailer come up in the theater it looked a bit basic but I kept thinking to myself there must be more to this if they're using this as the first film of the new universe. Boy oh boy, was I wrong, I seriously hope going forward that this is not the new baseline going forward. Blue Beetle felt possibly the closest thing I have seen to a slightly higher budget CW show but instead of evenly spreading its budget to everything equally they just spent most of it on the suit. I would easily rate this movie a star but the two extras are for the suit and Xolo, whom with a better script would definitely have been better. The jokes do not land whatsoever, in fact I swear I heard some of them done in other movies before, to call the story basic is too kind - it is literally the same story audiences have seen a hundred times, within the first 15 minutes you can practically predict where the entire plot is going to end up and somehow this movie makes it feel even more cheap. Not a great start to all of this, hope they keep the actor but do something completely different going forward.","

"jujudoll-39219","16 November 2023","Thank you DC, you have finally made a film that makes Green Lantern look quite good, which is saying something given how poorly served the character was in it, just the plot and general story telling, not the acting. Blue Beetle however has everything, terrible acting, almost a plot, almost but not quite, sub standard effects, a swing and a miss in every department. Who knew that super heroes (I use the term very lightly) did a ""Take your family to work day"" tragic in every meaning of the word. Too many histrionics from all concerned, if squealing, screaming and shouting were super powers these guys would be the tops. Not sure who this is aimed at, someone who has never seen a film before maybe, it wouldn't encourage them to watch another. Luckily it still isn't the worst film in the genre, that honour goes to Wakanda Forever, awful acting, stinking CGI, and worst of all the bastardization of what should have been an homage to one of Marvels original characters, Namor, The Submariner, shame on them.","

The script and animations are as bad as any of the CW shows, so it just feels like you're watching a 2hour episode of the Flash. The character development for the hero and antagonist are incredibly predictable - the family is going to lose the house, rich girl falls for witty street boy who just needs a chance, nothings more important than family, the list goes on and on. As someone who enjoys the character and original story, I appreciate the effort - but I'd love to see DC stop saturating their output of TV and films to focus on quality production.","

Blue bettle is all of the following: weak plot, boring, predictable, horrible acting, crappy writing, and much more... Another thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant screaming and chaos that is supposed to be representative of a Latino family perhaps? To me it was just a way to mask the lack of solid acting and a solid plot. I'll never understand when writers, directors don't even attempt to convince us to believe in what we're watching.. The movie isn't a comedy, at least not to me so grandmas kicking special military units ' butts isn't going to fly with me. I thought Black Adam was mediocre, this is just plain bad. Last point..

Childish, utterly child-like in its storyline.Stereo-typed Mexicans made out to be annoying and stupid. Maybe while the US doesn't want them to be citizens if we go by this story. And having a 70+ years grannie wielding a modern sub-machine gun is old fashioned and cartoonish. Nothing new, original or funny in the movie.There are way too many 'cartoon-hero' movies being released today and eventually they begin to repeat storylines and themes, as is the case here. Watch if you're a sci-fi addict. Bored with nothing else to do or forced to view, but can't see any real reason why anyone would want to waste 2 hours watching Blue Beetle.","

"kmkevinn-64733","21 August 2023","As blandly competent, cliched, and underwhelming as superhero films are becoming, Blue Beetle squanders an opportunity to do something truly new and revolutionary in favour of pulling remainders out of the recycling bin. While this latest DC offering does have some strong elements going for it, most of them revolving around the story's prominent Mexican-American representation, there's nothing inventive, new, or creative to be found within the actual story or it's mechanics. Blue Beetle is a boilerplate film welded together out of useable spare parts lifted from more successful and entertaining superhero films. Instead of redefining a genre and imbuing it with new life via a vibrant cultural backbone, Blue Beetle only further enhances the feelings of growing superhero fatigue. Let's start with the handful of things that work well in Blue Beetle, beginning and almost ending with the rich family dynamic that gives the film all of it's heart.The ""best"" moments in Blue Beetle come whenever the film simply lets the family members be themselves, the worst part that the drama does not exists, there was tons of Español musics. It does not larger cogs in a big budget, effects laden machine. This film is as generic as they come, we have seen it all before and done a lot better. The script could have easily been created by A. I. that watched a thousand hours of superhero films! Every detail of the adventure and backstory in Blue Beetle has been cobbled together from spare parts left over from Man of Steel, The Flash, every Batman film, every Spider-Man film (someone might as well just say ""with great power comes great responsibility"" here and just make it more obvious), Iron Man, Shazam, and Ant-Man.Blue Beetle is frustrating and forgettable because the potential for something better is evident, but it settles for the path most travelled instead. In my honest opinion, I don't think this film stands a chance at the box office, it reeks of writing by committee and corporate meddling. Blue Beetle isn't one of the worst films of the year, but it's absolutely one of the most disappointingly average ones.","

It had soooo much potential with the cast, visual effects, and great original story/background to use for Blue Beetle. However, it was a chore to keep my attention for more than 15-20 minutes at a time. The story is terrible. Action is far too limited. It's like a really bad, artificial vanilla taste after you take this movie in. I really tried to enjoy it but at the end just very unsatisfied and disappointed. Very huge miss with this one.

"lordanidem","23 November 2023","This is a new low for the genre. This movie has zero original thought and they try to hide it in a near offensive level of Hispanic stereotypes.Not all Hispanics are poor, nor do we somehow resent white people if we are. I don't constantly sing and dancin. I don't have a crazy uncle with a truck named ""Taco"".Get it!!! Taco Truck!!! That hysterical, said nobody...Seriously the only stereotype missing is the 4ft crucifix on the wall. A joke perfectly pulled off by the late Matthey Perry in the movie Fool's Rush In.And unfortunately there is Race Baiting. Intentionally mispronouncing of Jamie's name. A baddie (Susan Sarandon) who intentionally calls her Hispanic worker by the wrong names. A reference to a grandmother being a guerilla rebel fighting white imperialists for no reason except to explain her being able to use a belt fed cannon like Jesse Ventura in Predator...Nothing but pieced together but of other superhero movies. Leaning heavily on Iron Man and Spiderman.I almost want to cheer the inclusion of O. M. A. C., an obscure comic that I used to read. Untill I saw that what was a living breathing character wast turned into yet another cybernetic soilder suit.Iron Man 3 anyone???Then the made the OMAC suit a inexcusable copy of Maximilian from The Black Hole.

I don't mind a Hispanic hero but the way they portrayed the entire Hispanic portion of the cast was to take every stereotype you can think of and max them out. I can't believe the actors were not offended and did not quit. That is just one of many horrible things about this movie. The writing, the not scary at all villian lady, the way the writers had the characters constantly act and do incredibly stupid things, etc. I would say this is campy but it doesn't come across as a good campy.Thankfully I didn't pay for it, watched it free on max.","

All the scenes look quite tacky and just overall little effort is put into it. The acting all around is weak and it makes it difficult to connect to the characters.As much as Marvel has struggled since endgame, DC has made some of Marvels recent films like Christopher Nolan pieces.This is one of those movies where you can hardly remember the plot even a couple of days later.James Gunn has a huge project ahead in cleaning up the franchise.","

"josjwj","26 November 2023","As stated above this exact film would have been completely passable if still flawed if it had been released between 2001 & 2009. Now it's just a tedious. First I'll discuss the film's virtues and flaws regardless of its era and the elaborate on how it's era culminates to make it a chore to sit through.This film is led by Jaime Reyes played by Xolo Mariduea who us Cobra Kai fans know as Miguel Diaz the star eagle fang student. Solo's performance is perfectly acceptable for what the movie requires of him. Jaime is a fresh college graduate with a seemingly unplayable amount of student loan debt a super relatable problem and with the exception of Peter Parker(kinda) a problem never explored in a superhero film. If the film had focused on Jaimie's struggles with his debt a more interesting superhero film could have been made, but it doesn't because after this is revealed we meet his parents who are...Jaimie's parents and that's it, his sister who's an exposition machine and the worst of them all uncle Rudy played by George Lopez, uncle Rudy is the most obnoxiously cliche comic relief character I've seen in a long time, and like all the others cliche unfunny comic relief characters he doesn't go anywhere he's with us for the rest of the runtime. Even if this film had come out in an era where we were not yet fatigued by the ""superhero hero"" formula I'd still hate uncle Rudy!There's also a love interest and and an Obadiah Stane esc Villian played by Susan Sarandon. Susan Sarandon feels like she doesn't know why she is playing this character and puts in effort accordingly. The love interest is pretty much in the same boat as Xolo: perfectly acceptable for what little she has to work with.I'll check spoilers just in case but you can't spoil this movie it's a superhero origin film if you've seen any superhero origin story you've seen this movie. If you expect surprises you will be disappointed.Like I said in the first paragraph if this film had been released the period between 2001-2009: yeah I'd hate uncle Rudy and the villain seems uninteresting but that would be a decent 2 hour sit. Now when superhero films almost feel like they're coming off an assembly line it's almost infuriating to sit through. I'm a comic book film fan and I don't want them to fail and disappear I just want them made with passion. I'd rather have fewer that are made with heart than many that are interchangeable.","

"MrDHWong","14 September 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is a superhero film serving as the 14th installment in the DC Extended Universe. Starring Xolo Maridueña in the title role, it functions as a cookie-cutter superhero origin story that leaves little else to the imagination.After recently graduating from university, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns to his hometown in Palmera City. While awaiting a job opportunity at Kord Tower, Jaime is handed a small box by Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), the niece of the company CEO Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). Jenny tells Jaime to guard the box with his life and ensure its contents don't fall into the wrong hands. Upon arriving back home, Jaime's family convince him to open the box where they soon discover it contains a mysterious alien Scarab. When Jaime touches the Scarab, it fuses with his body, giving him a durable exoskeleton and super powers that allow him to become the hero known as the ""Blue Beetle"".Ever since the character's first appearance in 1939, the superhero Blue Beetle has undergone not one but three different canon iterations. The most recent of which is Jaime Reyes, whom upon debuting in 2006, has gone on to become arguably the most recognisable version of the character. From appearing on the TV series ""Smallville"" to being playable in various DC video games, it seems that the Reyes incarnation of Blue Beetle is the one that resonates most prominently with both modern comic book fans and novices alike. In 2023, the character made his live action film debut in the DC Extended Universe's ""Blue Beetle"", a cut-and-paste origin story adventure that feels all too familiar.There's hardly anything this film does that hasn't already been done in almost every superhero movie before it. From the very beginning, it's hard not to have a feeling of deja vu when the set up is first introduced to us. We watch as a team of explorers uncover an otherworldly artefact in Antarctica, which is then immediately handed over to a big-shot CEO of a major company who plans to use it for sinister purposes. Afterwards, we see the protagonist inadvertently becoming involved with said artefact, and using it to fight back against the villainous CEO before it is too late. Does that sound familiar to anyone? If it does then that's because the superhero genre has reached a point where it is near impossible for an origin story to follow any other set pattern. As a result, the film feels dated right out of the box. There simply isn't much entertainment value to be had other than perhaps through the occasional jokes about the lead character's ethnic origins. Maybe it's just superhero fatigue finally setting in, but I found nothing else worth mentioning about the film's plot.With that in mind, the film at least does a nice enough job at investing the audience in its overarching theme of familial bonding, something which is heavily emphasised in Latin American culture. Though they do feel a bit generic at times, I did like the parts where Jaime fights to protect those he cares about. The best scenes were when Jaime is learning about what powers he has and noticing that his family members support him along the way. It is clear here that the Reyes family have each other's backs no matter what, which is especially evident given how often they are seen placed in the way of danger. Without giving away spoilers, I particularly liked one scene that made great use of the family dynamic when they are required to fight back against a large number of enemies. In most other films, the main character's family members are either relegated to the background or end up used as a cheap plot device to move the story along, but here they are all used quite nicely. Even Jaime's elderly grandmother has a highlight moment.In the lead role, Xolo Maridueña was the perfect choice to play the eponymous character, not merely due to his Latin heritage but also because of the physicality involved. Anybody who watched Maridueña on ""Cobra Kai"" will likely remember his ability to handle himself in combat, dishing out blow after blow against his adversaries. It's just a shame that Jaime Reyes is so generically written in this movie, like somebody took Peter Parker/Spider-Man and gave him a Latin American paint job. That's not to say I disliked him as a whole, the problem is that I couldn't see anything in him that hasn't been done before in every other young, inexperienced, down-to-earth superhero protagonist since the genre first began. Still, there's room for growth should the character ever appear in a future DC film project.As previously mentioned, the Reyes family are what I would consider to be the emotional backbone for this film. Jaime's grandmother, known simply as ""Nana"", certainly knew how to hold her own whenever things got tough and Adriana Barraza's performance helped make her seem like she could definitely manage it. Nana was my favourite of Jaime's relatives because she seemed like someone with not only the necessary life experience but also the toughness to go along with it. Coming a close second would be Jaime's sister Milagro, played by Belissa Escobedo. Milagro is the type of younger sibling most of us would dream of having, always there to back you up in a pinch and never giving up on you when things turn ugly. In spite of the rest of the film's issues, It's comforting to see a superhero film that places such a strong significance on family values.However, I think Susan Sarandon was wasted as the film's main antagonist Victoria Kord. Her character is so one-dimensional and uninteresting that virtually any other actor/actress could have played the role. Kord is nothing more than your run-of-the-mill greedy CEO villain - she's rich, she's powerful, and she wants to destroy the hero at all costs. That's about it. Though they do attempt to give her some sympathetic backstory, it is never properly expanded upon beyond the fact that her family life is the polar opposite to Jaime's. This could have been a great opportunity to have made her a more layered character but instead the filmmakers played it too safe and her end fate is about as predictable as they come.When taking into consideration the varied quality of the DC Extended Universe, I suppose you could do a whole lot worse than ""Blue Beetle"". It serves its purpose as an obligatory introduction to the character for the uninitiated and sets the stage for his potential return should the studio executives see fit. The film's saving grace is its wholesome view on the necessity of having a loving family, which itself is hardly an original concept (the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies have been doing this for years). With all that said, I can only really recommend this film to hardcore fans of DC, because there are so many other better movies out there that are a more valuable use of one's time.I rate it 6/10.","

"postmeiska","4 January 2024","So this is what the new leadership of everything 'Warner Brothers' thinks the DC Universe should be about? The king of reality TV sure knows his audience. This stereotyped, dumbed down, regurgitated storyline is as predictable as sunrise and sunset. There are tons of reviews that accurately point out the issues with this mess of a movie. The problem is that there are about 60% of people that think this movie is perfectly fine. These are people who do not want to be challenged by a decent plot or care about anything more than blowing things up. Unfortunately more and more content is being created to satisfy their tastes. It's simply cheaper to produce. The appetite for mindless television and movies is at an all time high.","

"mason25","29 September 2023","CGI wasn't bad, that's about the only positive for the entire movie.The rest from the casting, to the music, to the plot, to everything else, was disgustingly terrible.Over the top stereotypes for basically every last character. With actors and comedians who had no right being cast in any type of role, looking mainly at George Lopez, he was terrible and not even mildly funny... so it's clear he drew on his massive repertoire of a career as a ""comedian"".The action was pretty ho hum, not a single power of the suit was explained in any way, let alone well.The OMAC suit wasn't a terrible premise, but it was shown terribly, along with fabrication of metal out of nowhere..... have we completely left any semblance of this taking place on an earth like planet???I finished it, but really should have taken the other reviews at face value.Overall this was aimed at folks who enjoyed power rangers or other really campy style shows for children.","

"JapanMovies","20 September 2023","After watching Blue Beetle for two hours, I couldn't help but laugh at the comedic elements of the movie. Sure, it was based on a comic book series, but the way the story was told made it more of a family comedy than a typical superhero flick.One of the standout characters in the movie was Xolo Mariduena's crazy relative, George Lopez. He brought a hilarious energy to every scene he was in, and his quips and one-liners had me chuckling throughout the entire movie.But at the core of the movie was a message about the importance of family and standing up against evil corporations. The main character, Jaime Reyes (played by Mariduena), was a relatable teenager who stumbled upon an alien artifact that gave him superpowers. But instead of using his newfound abilities for personal gain, he chose to fight against the corrupt corporation that was trying to exploit the artifact for their own gain.Throughout the movie, Jaime's family provided a grounding force for him, reminding him of his roots and what truly mattered in life. It was refreshing to see a superhero movie that prioritized family and relationships over flashy action sequences.All in all, Blue Beetle was a pleasant surprise. It had all the elements of a fun superhero movie, but with a comedic twist and a heartwarming message about the importance of family. I can't wait to see what adventures Jaime and his family will go on in future installments..","

"albertorbjuan","16 August 2023","When you think of a generic and formulaic superhero movie, you're possibly thinking of a C-grade villain without any depth to it, mediocre photography, sub-par visual effects, a predictable CGI-fest third act, horrible one-liners, and laughable acting.Blue Beetle contains all of the above. While DC is going through a thorough restructuring, Blue Beetle suffers from the former ownership which ignored good stories for maximizing revenue.Nonetheless, Xolo Maridueña is great as Blue Beetle, and we can't wait for him to show up in future DCU installments.The movie is a forgettable piece of film that will be good for getting a few laughs, and not caring about the story or fights, or stakes. Blue Beetle is sadly, another movie in the Super-Hero fatigue, which is no more than Bad Story-Fatigue.","

The special effects are pretty decent as well. It's the story and the directing. It's sooo predictable and silly. I mean uncle hops in a flying beetle and runs it like he built it. Dad dies but we gotta go kick some butt before we cry. And who ever made the Blue Beetle such a little scared wussy. Non-lethal.... You give my loved one a heart attack and you gonna get blown the hell up. All ya all gonna die. DC really needs to find a balance. They're either trying to be too dark or too campy. This one is way campy. Do better DC... do better.","

Logic? What's that? I feel like every minute I spent watching this in the cinema cost me a brain cell. Seriously, I only came to watch this because the films were on offer today, but now I feel like that 3 quid would've been much better spent on a packet of crisps.TLDR: watch this if you're very very drunk or a teenage boy.","

"mapine","22 September 2023","This is by far the very worst movie DC has ever put their stamp on... yes, even worse than that other one you're thinking about. I really tried to like it, I even gave it my full attention but it sucked so much. It was almost insulting in some aspects... you know what I mean... and it grossly insulted the franchise. At best... and this is a stretch... it's a mediocre, straight to video, B movie, that frankly should be left on the shelf and forgotten.The cgi was as expected, maybe they put all the money into special affects instead of script writing. The characters were so predictable and 2 dimensional, I've read better fan-fiction on reddit and they give it to us for free! This movie was simply bad at best.","

"manicmotionman","9 December 2023","$104 million, flushed down the toilet. This film just made me so upset with its sheer incompetence, I felt the need to vent with a review.The writing is egregiously lazy with no care given to character development... why would they need to? Every character is a poorly constructed copy of marginally better written ones from other films, so the writers must have assumed the audience will know them immediately. The whole script is just cobbled together from films of the same genre that had better success. People performing impossible physics, irritating screaming throughout, illogical choices made by characters to shoe-horn in story points and actions, practically plagiarized dialogue, the list of dumb goes on and on. The whole shebang felt like it was written by high school students as homework.The acting can't really be blamed for this absolute failure, though it is rather tepid all round, with Sarandon of all people being the worst. No, the blame is on the director who, without vision, ends up selling out to producers, most of whom are only concerned about the safest way to make a buck.Effects? It's a weird sensation to see so much action and be completely bored by it.DC has had one real franchise success with Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy and the rest are on a sliding scale of mediocrity. The massive budget comic book genre is dead, not unlike the massive budget sword and sandal epics of the 50's and 60's. If we're lucky, as a result of this insultingly lacklustre rubbish, a new New Wave of cinema is just around the corner.","

I hope to be a more famous Brazilian name like Wagner Moura in the future....Rotten Tomatoes is completely mad with the reviews for this thing!!! For real, its time to make good super-hero movies.","

"diversecleaning","18 October 2023","This was quite possibly the worst Superhero movie I have ever seen. It could actually be one of the worst all time movies which I have ever seen, except I have seen Sisu, Black Christmas (2006), Assault on Wall Street, and Chop Shop.The dialogue of Blue Beetle was dreadful... absolutely horrendous.The dialogue in Marvle movies is bad, but they are still leagues better than the dialogue in Blue Beetle.Black Widow was actually hilarious while Blue Beetle was cringe worthy.The storyline was ridiculous and was a knock of of Venom (Carnage) and Antman, but with none of the heart, or comedic punchlines.I hate to say it, but Blue Beetle was a box office flop, partially due to it being a terrible movie and partially owning to the rest of the world having zero interest in an all Hispanic Superhero movie.The movie did not even screen in China, which is the only market which seems to still enjoy these silly superhero movies.Dark Superhero movies play well in the United States, while Fast and the Furious and The Avengers have done well in China (and primarily China)..Why would you make a silly Superhero movie which doesn't play well to the foreign/Chinese box office?These studios really should pay more attention to what does well domestically and or what plays well internationally.The Hispanic box office hasn't even clamored for an all Hispanic led film.I'm sure if Blue Beetle was a better film, it would have done better at the box office domestically and internationally, but it was a terrible film and thus did very poorly financially.It is a shame though because I do like Xolo Maridueña, but Blue Beetle might kill any career he may have had.","

Lead actress is fitThe family are more interesting than the hero, terrible script. I would've preferred it if he'd died and the villains had won. The family didn't have an issue with killing villains so I don't know what the issue with the hero was.The effects were ok though, and the plot in general wasn't too bad, just utterly predictable.","

The characters are very naive and boring and no character growth among any characters and worst of all, the ending was very predictable and idealist. The main character seems to be too gentle and didn't want to hurt anyone to a degree that it was upsetting for me to watch. The romance between 2 characters are also very forced. Blue beetle seem to have a lot of humour in the beginning that i initially enjoy but the movie itself rendered all efforts for comedy essentially useless. In short, the movie was a waste of money and time.","

Not just ""dropped"" the ball, they dug a hole, put in a blue box, nailed it shut and sent it to the bottom of the sea! (Sorry AQUAMAN,) It's not even on the same universe.Don't get me wrong the acting is good, but when George Lopez goes from ""Not knowing anything""
to ""All of a sudden he knows almost everything."" And the plot makes my head hurt. Seriously, I got headache from watching this.DC was making a universe of NEW superheroes and it was shaping up slowly. ""Black Adam"" was really interesting, watching the origin of an ""anti-hero"". The 2nd storyline in the DCU was with the long awaited ""Flash"" which had cameos by Henry Cavill & Gal Godot. Blue Beetle has to have his whole family to fly the Bug-mobile. I remember in the DC comic, it only needed only 1. They must have paid Susan Sarandon a lot for her role as the Ultra Villain. I even thought she was going to say: ""Blue Beetle, I've got you now..hee-hee-hee!I lost count how many times the Villains have shot Blue Beetle & watch it bounce off him, they shoot him anyway.Stupidest thing is all end of the movie even grandma is firing a super gun!

"chenp-54708","19 August 2023","It was okay.It's the typical superhero movie with some fun action moments and solid performances from the cast members. DC Comics has made some pretty good superhero movies in the past but also some pretty bad ones too. Blue Beetle was mainly okay. Throughout, there were some pretty good productions and the superhero/action moments were solid with some fun fight sequences and colorful effects. The direction was alright but there were a few moments that felt a little sloppy. The performances from the cast members were mostly good as Xolo Maridueña does a pretty good job performing his role as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle alongside Susan Sarandon, Adriana Barraza and George Lopez as well.For the story, it was fine. It didn't feel too special or as interesting as some of the other superhero stories. Throughout, the camerawork has some solid shot moments and while the humor was mostly meh, there were a few good humor moments. The characters were okay but they weren't fully investing to connect with. There are some dialogue moments that could improve and the uses of special effects and CGI were good. However, there are some not so great CGI aspects but it is definitely better than The Flash.If this movie had came out in the 1990s, I feel like it would have been an smashing hit. Overall, it's not the best DC Comics movie but it does have some good entertaining moments and it's an okay pop-corn piece of entertainment.","

A weak plot, incredibly mundane script and George Lopez's role was an eye roller. (part of the reason I wanted to see the film is because his name was on the marquee; what a disappointment) and I'm not sure I will ever look at Susan Sarandon with the same regard ever again. (she must've been really hard up for a paycheque or something) I also gathered that it was meant to be 'Latino positive'; in my view, the insultingly bad writing made for the opposite result. The special effects are pretty good but that is the only redeeming quality about this movie.","

"ernestobladins","19 August 2023","I didn't have much expectations from this movie, with DC the bar is so low for me lately. The movie follows the standard origin story that we have seen so mantener times before:A protagonist who is trying to live as best as he can his ordinary and mediocre life, is suddenly in contact with a ""special thing created by evil people"" that accidentally gives him superhero powers that he didn't ask for.He struggles to control those powers, causing him to be in uncomfortable situations that cause him to wanna give up his powers and go back to his ordinary life.But when the evil people begin threatening everyone he loves in order to get the powers he has, he is forced to do everything he can to save them, and make sure that those ""evil people"" never get those powers that could be used to destroy the world.As you can see, this is not exactly what one w wouldn't call original stuff. Can it get more generic than this plot after 15 years of superhero movies?The protagonists in this movie doesn't seem o have any agency or his own, he is pretty much nothing without his suit which does all the cool stuff for him, and also he is nothing without his family who saves him so many times.The antagonists and their motivation is also super generic and so dated at this point:""Oh wow, another movie where the entire world is at stake if the wrong hands get the magical stuff that gave him powers... Man I really wonder if this time the world is going to end"". ""Who knows maybe this time it will"".This is not a movie i would recommend watching in the theatre, simply because it is not really a fresh story. It doesn't really add anything new to the genre.The jokes and humour is something that i felt coming every single time because the set ups for the jokes are so obvious, as we have seen them in countless of other marvel movies before.I don't know man. It's the kind of movie that only a kid who has never seen any superhero movie before might enjoy. If you've only watch two or three superhero movies you might think it's great. But for those who have been watching superhero movies for a while this is just more of the same thing.It's like watching a NSFW video on the internet for the hundred time.","

Showing it off to his family & getting too close to it, causes the object to merge violently into Mariduena's body forming a Guyver like figure which communicates w/him via an internal AI (voiced by singer Becky G) which takes the lead in his use of the suit, since they haven't been fully integrated w/each other. Pissed since she wants to incorporate the tech into battle suits of her own, Sarandon sends out her henchman, Raoul Trujillo (who I remember from Scanners II) to take Mariduena down using any means to his disposal, even going after his family, which results in tragic consequences. Will Mariduena step up & save the day? Fun through & through w/a healthy foothold in the Latin world will make this story, which is very familiar, come alive which unfortunately due to Warner Bros. Ham-fisted handling of their disavowal of the previous DC output continues to paint audiences perceptions if they should venture out to cinemas to watch these things since their emotional investment can be spent elsewhere which is a shame since this film could've done w/Latin fans what Black Panther did for African American ones. Also starring Elpidia Carrillo as Mariduena's mom, Oscar nominee Adriana Barrazza as his grandmom, Harvey Guillen from What We Do in the Shadows as a techie & George Lopez as the crazy uncle of the family who steals every scene he's in.","

"fazetrap-72267","19 August 2023","The movie is a perfect 6/10 star superhero flick. There's nothing new or interesting or anything creative about it. Heard it was originally a Max exclusive. To be honest, wouldn't be surprised if it got dumped there anyway. This is the most Marvel-like DC superhero flick you'll ever see in a while. It doesn't do much new, or even breaks any new ground in the superhero movie genre (not that there's any left to be broken anyway).I did like the family dynamics a little, but if anyone's seen Ms. Marvel of the MCU (that makes like, ten people including me), it will all seem a little too familiar, except this time they are Latino. Some jokes are drawn out a little too much, and just like Marvel, serious moments are diluted with dank jokes that nobody laughs at, except maybe the cast and crew themselves. The villain, was... as expected, forgettable. Makes sense why they didn't feature her prominently in any of the promo or trailers. But hey, when you're making brand-safe superhero movies for kids you gotta draw some lines, I guess.Overall, DC is just a scalding hot mess now, on an uncertain path both creatively and logically. I didn't even try to connect this movie in my head to any of the confusing mess of the DCEU and didn't even bother to use it as a foundation for James Gunn's Universe. If anyone wants, see for what it is and don't take it too seriously. If you don't, fine. The superhero film genre breathed its last on April 26, 2019 anyway.","

There were only 2 nice minutes out of the disappointing +2 hours runtime that you may label watchable. The story has nothing interesting going for it, the cast carried an embarrassing underwhelming performance and the characters were as bland and generic as any family superhero movie you can imagine. A superhero movie is nothing without a worthy villain which this obviously didn't have, instead we got a cardboard villain picked up from the nearest dumpster. No matter how you look at it, this is a disappointing superhero/family movie.","

Which is saying a lot.So much tongue and cheek jokes that never deliver. A painfully slow delivery. It's like a 2 hour movie with 29 minutes if content maximum.Almost zero recognizable actors. Most of the budget was probably on CGI and Susan Sarandon...which probably needed a ton of cgi to look 40 years younger. And she is such an odd choice given she is more a lifetime channel actress. Not a superhero one.Much if this felt like an acting classes improvisation f in the show barry.This was the most painful movie I have had to watch this year. And that is saying a lot given the quality these past couple years in Hollywood.","

Imagine being sad because she remembered her past and then the boy talks a little then they kiss. So very old style. So not connected. This scenario is very common in low class clubs where there are sad boys or sad girls that gets comforted then gets fkd. Then there is too much shouting in normal conversations like they all want attention.The only thing I like is the fighting graphics. But still the hero is very dramatic and stupd in his decisions.They wasted the potential of the movie. With their budget a high school student can make it better.","

"gehete-40949","31 October 2023","One of the many grave sins of hollywood is the marginalization of class struggle. The bud of the joke are most of the time the favorite opressed individuals, immigrants, different religious backgrounds, niche artisans with low income etc. Dc like Disney or Marvel, with executives that are as close to working class struggle as the sun is to the moon love to think of themselves as educators and illuminators when forcing such narratives down the writers and directors throats. So we as the consumer are supposed to get inspired by the very unlikely success stories again shoved down our eyes. It is cheap, it is disingenous and always backwards in any human capacity. So this movie is not different in that sense only with the slight off premise of the social climber becoming a super hero. Stop mass producing backwards narratives please.","

"ryanpersaud-59415","24 November 2023","Watching Blue Beetle, I couldn't help but feel that there was absolutely no way this story was going to be continued. Yes, that's because of the impending end of the moribund DCEU, but there's a flash-in-the-pan energy to this movie; the reality is, making a Blue Beetle movie is either an act of supreme confidence (ala Guardians of the Galaxy) or supreme desperation (it's already greenlit, we might as well finish it). I suspect it's the latter.Because Blue Beetle, whilst having some diehard fans, is decidedly D tier in the DC Universe. Personally, I've never really connected with the character, but to be honest, I liked what I saw here. Jaime Reyes (played by Xolo Mariudena) is a likeable, fun protagonist, the sort of old school Spiderman type that DC desperately needs. His family is fun, with George Lopez being the clear highlight, even if the film beats you over the head with the theme of FAMILY more than a Fast & Furious film. It's sweet, but a bit cheesy.The action scenes are surprisingly good (for the most part), with a lot of creative uses of the Blue Beetle's power set. They're easy to comprehend, well choreographed, and you really feel the impact of each hit and punch. Aside from one action scene in particular (outside of Jaime's house), they're well done and memorable.And, I do have to commend the final fight of this film. The film goes in a direction I genuinely didn't expect thematically, and it handles some truly weighty themes. Yes, I know this film is focused on the Mexican-American experience, ""familia,"" and is set in a gorgeous Miami/Los Angeles hybrid (Palmera City is without a doubt the best looking and most memorable city in the DCEU - the Batman's Gotham doesn't count, because that would obviously take the crown).The moment with Raoul Trujillo (he essentially plays the bruiser for Susan Sarandon's um...antagonist, I legitimately forgot her name) basically is revealed to have been a child soldier captured by the U. S. Army and turned into a super soldier is surprisingly powerful. It puts into context what this silly superhero movie is really about: criticizing the long history of U. S. imperialism in Latin America and the exploitative capitalism and white supremacy that entailed. Heavy stuff.However, I'd be lying if I said this film was anything more than a slightly-better-than-expected, yet mostly average superhero romp. The script - outside of some nice moments and funny lines - is pretty awful; it's predictable, basic, and sometimes feels written by an AI. Most of the characters are banal and unmemorable, particularly Jaime's love interest and Susan Sarandon's Victoria Kord. To say Sarandon was definitely miscast in this film would be an understatement. She has no screen presence, feels like she's running through the motions, and is completely forgettable.I also kind of wish the Blue Beetle lore was better explained and that the ""Scarab"" (the device that turns Jaime into the BB) had more of a personality. I think if this film ever got a sequel, they'd focus more on that, but generally...it's a missed opportunity.","

But none of these films featured a Latino dude so here we go, now we have a Latino one too now. But literally nothing else new. DCEU movies used to be dark but then I guess Warner Brothers saw a little humour adds to the movie so they started doing that too, it kind of worked in other DCEU movies but not in this one, it's not funny it's just plain lame. What's up with the fighter grandma jokes? Oh my god, this movie is so cringe. It used to be Wonder Woman 2 but this is now the worst DCEU movie ever made.","

See where she was dropped by her Management Agency for things she recently said, pitiful. If this is the best Hollywood can come up with, maybe they should have stayed out on strike. If you are reading this for guidance, don't waste your time on this movie it's a another FUBAR from Warner Media and DC Comics. Where's Zach Snyder when you need a good movie.","

Xolo - it would not be fair to him to not let him spread his wings - it's called wings on bugs too, right? I actually have no idea - anyway.If you suspend your disbelief and take this with a grain of salt, this can be a lot of fun! There are quite a few super hero tropes and cliches thrown your way. But if you are a cynic, than no superhero movie actually will be able to do the trick for you. Yes beautiful girl, yes pretty boy ... of course they are meant for each other! Every one knows it - except those two. Well for most of the time at least.Also the convenient timing of it all - the villain who seems incapable of ... functioning. But again, all those things - seen before and ""flaws"" that can be detected in every other super hero franchise. Just go with the flow and accept this. CGI is quite neat, music is nice (even though I am surprised they use known English songs but the Spanish versions of them. Also telenovela ... also Lopez! You either find him funny or extremely annoying ... hopefully the former! Otherwise almost the whole movie is ruined. Shame it tanked ... at the box office! Deserved more.","

"weitzel3","24 August 2023","This is probably the worst movie I've seen, and I watched Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey.Every character in this movie was terribly written and made the movie worse for being there. The script was horrendous. I hope to never see George Lopez in another movie after this one; I absolutely hated his character. Just terrible. From the super-smart, smart-ass, stupid uncle to the sweet old grandma who led a revolution at the end, and the mother who's only purpose for being in the movie was to support her son for 5 seconds at the very end, everyone sucked. Xolo Mariduena was a good choice for Blue Beetle but he couldn't save this movie from the terrible writing and directing. He was the only actor I didn't loath by the end of the movie.Just awful. The story was incredibly predictable from the first 10 minutes. The directing was terrible. Important or heartfelt scenes fell flat, the jokes never landed, the action was boring. It felt like a knock-off version of Ironman, but not good. I am mad at myself for wasting my time with it.And the worst thing is the studio will try to blame the writers / actors strike for the bad box office. The writers are to blame for the script and story, so they deserve some of the blame. But the movie is going to flop because it is truly terrible.DC has some of the coolest superheroes, but they can't make a movie worth watching. Blue Beetle has so much potential, I wish it had been made by the early marvel studios.","

Sounds a lot like Venom...Just not as funny and with much poorer acting. The plot is just bad. Susan Sarandon is only slightly believable as an evil mastermind. Xolo is stretched beyond his apparent acting ability. And George Lopez is just George, but with a horrible goatee. 2/3 of the theater walked out of this tragic excuse for a superhero movie.

Mix the butter and sugar together very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Fold in the flour, baking powder, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt as quickly as you can. Don't overwork the dough.2. leave the mixture overnight: either cover the bowl and chill, or roll the mixture into balls and chill.3. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment. Divide the mixture into balls, the craggier the balls, the rougher the cookies will look. If you want to give the dough more texture, tear the balls in half and squidge them lightly back together. Space out evenly on the baking sheets, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading.4. Bake the fresh cookies for 8-10 mins and the chilled ones for 10-12 mins, or until browned and a little crisp at the edges but still very soft in the middle - they will harden a little as they cool. Leave to cool on the tray for a few minutes before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Enjoy, at least cookies are enjoyable, unlike this movie.","

"thePopcornExplorer","20 November 2023","I guess my first question in retrospective is why did I even watch this, I promised myself since the Black Adam disaster I wouldn't see any more DC movies and I still saw this one, I guess since I became a huge fan of the Cobra Kai TV show I was curious to see Xolo on a different role but I will stick to my original promise.There's isn't much to add that wasn't already stated on most of the reviews, it's a basic movie, with the same standard formula of super hero film since the late 2000's, cringe, predictable and with poor dialogue, the acting even from big names like Susan Sarandon was vey off putting, for some reason there are a few dark scenes that don't quite match the overall soft and goofy tone of the film which also felt weird and overall it is a bad flick.I guess it was a good era for super hero fans but all evidence point to a decline of the genre, even Marvel has been having a horrible set of movies and TV shows with one or two exceptions, I feel that this won't happen because money always talks louder but I feel we should move on to the next thing, we ran out of new fresh ideas and are stuck with boring, pointless and superficial stories.I guess the only good thing about this film and the reason I am not rating it lower is some cool scenes of fighting with nice VFX and soundtrack and of course the Spanish-American representation, I am all up for popular flicks to have this diversity and I think Hollywood would do everyone more justice if the stories were actually good.","

"arfdawg-1","28 September 2023","I loved comix as a kid. Never heard of the Blue Beetle, but after seeing this flick I was glad about that.OK so this is a Hispanic super hero, which is fine. But the movie is low budget and just dismal.Why couldnt they give it some good special effects?There are some decent moments but not many.The real problem, as I just intimated, is that the budget for this is really, really low. In fact, you can't imagine how minimal DC put money behind this until you see t.And I don't know why.The story would easily go more main streem There was some substance beind this. But there wan't. It's just recycled typical garbage.","

"nzrlsyzwn","20 September 2023","The Blue Beetle is a generic action film that fails to stand out from the countless other movies in the genre. The plot is shallow and predictable, with a shallow robotic villain (a blue beetle) for a villain and a generic hero as our protagonist. The CGI and fight scenes are passable, but nothing memorable. The acting is decent, but the dialogue is nothing special. All in all, this is a generic action movie that is watchable, but nothing special. It won't win any awards, but it will provide a bit of entertainment if you're a fan of the genre.Blue Beetle was an awful, generic movie. The acting was wooden, the story was predictable, and the characters completely lacked depth. None of the actors made an effort to make their character believable, and the script was so cliché it could have been written by a child. Moreover, the special effects were so outdated they looked like something out of an old TV show, not a movie. Even the soundtrack was generic and stale. In all, Blue Beetle was a waste of time, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","

"jerry-32590","22 November 2023","It's as if the story was written by a 10 year old boy. The plot is super predictable and pretty much just mix and match of other movie story parts. The special effects are just the routine stuff in low budget movies. Acting is probably the worst part. I like the fact a Mexican is the protagonist in this movie, but the juvenile story and poor acting really backfires. After the first 10 minutes of the movie, you already know how it's going to go and end. Many parts of the movie makes no sense at all, like how his uncle is a tech guru and yet the family is completely broke. Also, a very poor family has a high end computer? This movie wants to be iron man or some marvel super hero movie, but failed miserably.","

"kengroen-71781","19 August 2023","Maybe focusing more on plot than making political statements could've helped? But that wouldn't make up for the bad acting. George Lopez almost single handedly ruined the movie. The plot holes were as numerous as the empty seats in the theater. The attempts at comedy were terrible misses. I'm assuming it was geared towards a certain audience but I honestly can't think of any demographic that would enjoy this movie in its entirety. The fight sequences were the only saving grace. If you lose a bet and are forced to take your worst enemy to a movie this is the one for you. I'm being overly generous with the 4/10.","

I was hoping that this movie will be a good movie.. its been along time now that we dosnt see a good Adventure movie.. but any way i watch it and what i can say that this movie was more for kits.. if you are older than 7 years old you will feel boring after 10 minutes.. tha act is bad and the cast is cheap.. i kind understood what will happen next before ist happened. No thing special or attractive about the cast, this is will be a good kids movie.There's not much more to say. When I say accessible, I mean to the majority. Basic working class folk who care about food on the table & a roof over their heads. Give them something good. Something to escape into. Something relatable. But don't be condescending.","

Blue Beetle is exactly what I want out of a superhero film and that is to be fun. Trust me you will have a good time watching this film. Blue Beetle is one of the better recent DC Superhero movies. The action is great and the story about family at the center is strong. I also thought the visuals were 10x better here then what we got in the last Flash and Justice League films. I really hope we get another Blue Beetle sequel in the near future. Blue Beetle gets a solid 7 out of 10. You will like this movie!","

This brought out literally groans from the audience.CGI is cool. Chicks are bad but more annoying and pressed than self sufficient and strong. Every character is exactly the same as every other character you'd find in any other poorly cast DC movie. George Lopez returned as the villain from Lava Boy and Shark Chick though.","

"johmil-18374","20 November 2023","This movie main core is family and how important that is. Sure that would be fine enough except this is the most cartonish annoying family you will see in a while.This movie has two actors that are ok and that is Xolo (protagonist) and Susan Sarandon (antogonist). Susan really is killing it and they should base much more of the movie on her.Javiers (Xolo) family is as I mentioned before just like annoying stereotypical personalities on speed. Outside the family is Bruna (Jenny Kord) so unbelivable in any kind of position in the Kord company. She just does a terrible performance in this role.The bug suit is kind of cool in the beginning but you loose interest in that in like five minutes. We have seen similair suits before.Many complain on the latest hero movies like Flash, Quantumania and so on. But they are still ok movies. This is just not that... and this character will not be in any other movie I hope.","

George Lopez as as a good idea. Stop giving this guy work, he's not funny and can't act.I assume Susan Sarandon is the n need of the money, why else would she be part of this considering what she has delivered before.","

but I think that somewhat inexperienced actors are more successful, to be superheroes,, apart from the protagonist actor, I liked the idea, the setting, despite not knowing any self-respecting Mexican actor, I think the family performed well in their role as quadruple actors in the film I don't know if this film will be as successful as most of Marvel's films, I don't know, but it's certainly better than Fantastic Four, and some box office abuse, congratulations, to the producer and author, for the film!!!!","

This was exactly like watching Televisa.Xolo had a good acting but the rest, including Susan Sarandon were pretty bad. It looked like she didn't wanted to be in the movie in first place.I watch these kind of movies to disconnect from reality but all I saw was Puerto Rico. There wasn't much effort in constructing a place to set up.As a writer I really didn't like the script. It was very poor written and again, nothing different from all the telenovelas I'd watch when I was a little girl.I could see the gentrification claims, and other complaints we hispanic/latinos and Caribbean have, but we (I) don't need to see it in movies. We want entertainment, especially in superheroe movies.","

"natmavila","30 December 2023","Ah, ""Blue Beetle,"" the latest superhero extravaganza that takes us from the frosty tundra of Antarctica to the sunny streets of Palmera City. As a Latino, it's genuinely heartwarming to see a superhero who shares a part of my cultural background. It's like finally getting an invite to the big league superhero table, and the guacamole is just right!The plot? A whirlwind of corporate espionage, family drama, and a hefty dose of alien tech. Jaime Reyes, fresh from Gotham Law (because where else do you study law in a superhero universe?), finds himself embroiled in a mess involving an ancient alien artifact and Kord Industries. The story has its moments, especially when it taps into the family struggles and the whole eviction subplot - it's like a telenovela with more spandex and less melodramatic gasping.Now, Becky G as the voice of Khaji-Da? Absolute casting gold. She brings a certain flair to the sentient Scarab, balancing between sassy and wise. It's like having a tiny, armored life coach attached to your spine, constantly giving you pep talks and occasionally morphing into a battle suit.But here's the rub - ""Blue Beetle"" flutters between being really engaging and feeling like a checklist of superhero tropes. The whole OMAC angle with Victoria Kord felt like I've seen it before in a dozen other hero flicks. Plus, the final battle? Predictable. I mean, come on, even my abuela guessed the twist with Carapax's tragic backstory. And the whole mid-credits scene with the ""Ted is alive"" spiel? It's like they're not even trying to surprise us anymore.In conclusion, ""Blue Beetle"" is like that new restaurant everyone's been hyping up - it's good, the ambiance is nice, and the guacamole (read: Latino representation) is on point. But at the end of the day, it's not the culinary revelation everyone promised. It's a solid 3.5 stars - a fun ride but not quite the gourmet experience of superhero cinema. Now, if they'd just let Becky G sing in the sequel...","

The story is unfortunately one that we have seen milion of times over and over again. Its like we already saw this movie, however, still it flows .However in my opinion it's major flaw is what the studio said is it's major selling point, that is the fact that it's the first major Latino superhero. However the latinos in this movie act as the most stereotypical way, loud , poor, the granny straight out of Coco, the taco eating , the crazy truck etc etc.","

"egorks","24 September 2023","Modern movies should consider existing culture, especially when making movies about modern world. Current one does not consider any sort of reality related character conditions. All of them are flat, stupid, not able to predict any immediate implications, purely reactive and totally oblivious of consequences of their actions (even if one substracts sci-fi part of the situation). What is particularly disapointing is the fact that even characters like kord daughter who supposedly should know about corporation and its inner workings acts like a 5th grader not able to plan even 1.5 steps ahead. Main character in fact demonstrates complete lack of any logical analysis whatsoever. Movie about little kids in grownups bodies, who are just mainly lucky because villain is not much smarter. I find especially hillarious main hero constantly pleading to villains ""get me out of here"" or ""let me go""","

"musicista-38011","15 November 2023","I've always liked the original DC character, and to be honest I've always been more of a DC fan rather than Marvel.I was hoping that this underrated character would gain some good popularity with this film, but -alas!- I was a bit disappointed.The problem is that the first Marvel films were so good, we got used to a very high standard and our brains keep demanding great writing, character development, acting, special effecs and so on and so forth. Basically we have very high expectations and, as it happens, that leads often to disappointment.Imagine, if you will, that you could show this film in 2003 for instance. The outcome would have been very different, it would have been a smash hit, a record breaker, even with the imperfections that are so obvious to us today.Don't get me wrong, this film isn't rubbish... it's just a bit too predictable and the writing is a bit, umm, how do you say that in the USA?

During the exhibition, there were no moments of deep reflection that changed my perspective on life, but that is not necessarily a negative thing. It was a great option to relax on a Sunday night, fulfilling its mission of providing entertainment.The performances were well executed, although some characters were not fully explored, showing a certain rush in presenting certain plot points. However, this aspect did not detract from the entertainment experience.As a Brazilian, I highlight the performance of actress Bruna Marquezine. She didn't compromise the film in any way and fulfilled her role well, which wasn't a basic role of a girl being saved by the hero. She had her moment.","

It felt like he was a side character in his own movie. The story felt really flat and once again another villain with out purpose of being bad. It's just a flat boring superhero movie we've been getting for the past 5 years. The movie should've been about the scarab and introduce the reach who made it. Instead it felt more of his family origin story becoming ""heros"" instead of blue beetles origin. What we saw of him becoming blue beetles origin felt rushed. The best part about this movie was xolo and the suit. He did a great job for his first big screen appearance and he has a bright future. His sister wasn't that good at acting and neither was the mom. The father was great and George Lopez was alright. The Grandma was just eh. They made the movie too funny and oftentimes it was too much and forced. And there was too much propaganda in this film. I'm Mexican and Puerto Rican and it was too much. I was annoyed when they said the government has no problem with locking up Mexicans. It was just too much. And half of the time something that came out of George Lopezs mouth it was something about the government being against Mexicans.","

Well that, and the part where he bit into the taco and went 'mmmm' without even chewing for flavor.Why was he 'chosen' again? Cause he white-knighted for the girl?A chopper with a weapon is trying to kill/capture your family, beetle boy got a clear shot to incapacitate them all but one look at his father having a heart attack made him stop what he is doing. He didn't think for a second that by stopping the threat targeting EVERYONE might be a better decision than to stop and get emotional and thereby get caught anyway? OMG stop I can't watch anymoreSo a few minutes later he would refuse to kill or at least permanently disable villains who would try and kill his family while at the same time his family members found it easy to step / impale soldiers with a huge bug leg.

"ogboiehioma","19 August 2023","From start to finish, blue beetle fails to deliver the excitement and engagement that one would expect from a superhero film. Despite the promise of epic battles and thrilling heroics, the movie falls flat in almost every aspect.The plot feels disjointed and lacks a clear sense of direction. The filmmakers attempt to incorporate multiple storylines and subplots, resulting in a cluttered narrative that's difficult to follow. This confusion extends to the characters, who lack depth and development. Even the titular superhero feels one-dimensional, making it hard to empathize or connect with their struggles.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of blue beetle is its failure to capitalize on the potential for social commentary that the superhero genre often offers. The movie seems content to stick to tired clichés rather than explore meaningful themes or address relevant issues.","

"jamesgreenwall","17 December 2023","Blue Beetle, a movie directed by Angel Manuel Soto, is a superhero movie staring Xolo Mariduena as Jamie Reyes, the Blue Beetle. The film focuses on Jamie and his life after he gets ""possessed"" by a blue scarab. However this movie has two main flaws that really make it a mid tier movie.The movie overall is honestly not horrible. It is a very middle ground movie, however it falls flat firstly, because it just follows the same plot lines and cliches of other super hero movies. The movie revolves around the theme of family and how it is the true power, and it lasts forever. This is cool and all, however it has just been used so many times. This movies theme feels almost like a copy and paste of Shazam, with just a rewrite.I'm not saying this movie isn't enjoyable though. The cinematography is very enticing. The suits, espically Blue Beetle's is very well done. The fighting scenes and the scenes in general were all around pretty good. It was very enjoyable, however the second flaw of the movie is that the acting is bad from almost the entire cast. The acting really just feels forced and cheesy and it isn't good. It falls flat espically from Mariduena. His character, Jessie is just so basic it hurts. It feels like too much of a classic hero troupe. Innocent, kind, loving, awkward. It's really just so cliche and it doesn't fall together well at all. Making it hard to watch at parts.However in conclusion the movie was entertaining and overall not horrible. Sure not great but it is a fun watch for families, probably with more adult kids, and overall is not a bad super hero movie, just middle ground and cliche.","

Especially considering they were able to bin the entire Batgirl film. Blue Beetle should have been scrapped before release. It's a terrible film.There are so many plot holes, that compact over and over again it's exhausting to even unravel. Blue Beetle is such a terrible character in the comics and now onscreen. The OMAC angle is such a tried motif. Yet it's needed because how else can you find a villain strong enough to challenge what is essential and invincible, indestructible scarab armour.Truly it's like watching Halle Berry's Catwoman with poor Susanne Sarandon playing the same lame character Sharon Stone played in said film. The whole thing is nauseating.This should have been produced as an animation and even then it would have been at least a desperate filler for 10 year olds on a plane ride.","

While the premise is intriguing, the execution falls flat.The film's primary issue is its lackluster storytelling. The plot feels disjointed, and character development is minimal. As a result, viewers are given little reason to become emotionally invested in Jaime Reyes or his journey as the Blue Beetle. The potential depth and complexity that could have enriched this superhero origin story are disappointingly absent.The action sequences, while occasionally entertaining, are hindered by mediocre CGI and uninspired choreography. Additionally, the absence of memorable villains further diminishes the film's impact, leaving audiences yearning for a more compelling antagonist to challenge our hero.It's disheartening to witness DC struggling to find its place in the superhero film landscape, particularly when compared to the consistent success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ""Blue Beetle"" represented an opportunity to introduce an exciting new character to the DCEU, but it ultimately falls short.While the film is not devoid of merits, such as some decent performances from the cast, it is evident that ""Blue Beetle"" lacks the depth and vision necessary to elevate DC's cinematic universe.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 August 2023","'Blue Beetle (2023)' is... actually pretty good? It's a bit of a weird one in the sense that it's exactly what you'd expect and it's even pretty janky in places, but it's pretty fun when it gets going (even while committing the same mistakes a lot of its peers have been making for the past two decades) and its emotionality is surprisingly resonant at times. You've seen it all before, for sure: a generic and slightly intangible origin story that focuses on heavy-handed themes of family (it might as well be an entry in the 'Fast and Furious' franchise) and has its hero eventually take on a baddie that's basically just a palette swap of them. Yet, there's just something that makes it more enjoyable than most of the other entries in the DCEU, an intangible charm that you can't quite put your finger on no matter how hard you try. The cast are mostly charismatic (the good guys, at least; Susan Sarandon is sleepwalking here and the main henchman is really boring), the comedy sometimes makes you chuckle (mostly thanks to George Lopez), the action is fairly energetic, and the messaging - as ham-fisted and often forced as it is - often leads to some shockingly affecting moments that make you realise how invested in the characters you must actually be. It's actually the latter that tips this into the solidly 'good' category for me, as a lot of the affair is middling to decent at best. It's honestly fairly forgettable, too. Overall, though, it just works way more than it ought to; it's better than the sum of its parts. It's not something I'm desperate to watch again, but it's far better than 'Black Adam (2022)' and it's a bit of a shame that it sits in this odd limbo between the existing DCEU and James Gunn's upcoming DCU. It's not going to cure your superhero fatigue, but it should entertain you if you're not tired of this stuff just yet.","

Yes but with a difference.Different continent with a whole new character with a plot that mixes Iron Man with Venom which makes for an interesting story.Our main lead 'Jaime Reyes' fresh from graduating from Uni finding himself in the world gets a pleasant surprise to say the least...What's most evident from this movie is it's heart, family being a core value that drives the story leaving you feeling invested in the warm aspect of the movie.Action is very good throughout, the set pieces are very good with a great supporting cast, an enjoyable watch that's worth a viewing.","

"baryxxx","1 September 2023","This was bad on so many levels. All the characters but few are annoying. Story is a copied cliché superhero story. They took elements from all other superhero movies (and mostly from their competition - Marvel) and recycled them into this one. Almost everything this movie offers, you have already seen a better version of it in other superhero movies. And let me repeat again, a huge majority of characters are incredibly annoying. They are trying too hard to force you to laugh, which just leaves you annoyed and furious at yourself for spending your money to watch this heap of cinematic junk. And mind you, I spent $3 to watch this. Still not worth it.2/10 just because I've seen even worse.","

Either you are movie buff or a critic or does not know the first thing about making a film , your conclusion will be : DC have made a piece of trash. I give it 4 stars and I'm being very generous , i mean i was waiting for this movie so long and this what i get , man I am so sad and disappointed . The movie is full of clichés , the plot does not exist , weak acting ,poor directing . If you wanna scroll through your phone while running a movie , well you found the perfect film .","

"lockout-59506","29 October 2023","Blue beetle being a lesser known hero of the DCU, had a chance at being a good movie. Unfortunately it doesnt live up to the hype and in several cases in sinks to much lower levels than expected.Not sure if its because of the times or what but I have lived ina heavily populated mexican area in SoCal for the last 20 years and most mexicans dont have a bad taste for America. Many are greatful for the opportunities and the life they have been able to build since moving here. Yet this movie portrays a dislike for the country and I have to believe its jumping on the train of ""America bad to foriegners"" narrative. Its sad to see as I Know a great deal of people who are fron outside this country that have real love and respect for what this nation representsIf its not the several disses towards the nation its the obnoxious sister that really drags down this movie. I also dont understand why all the superhero movies make the main character a clueless genius. Almost ever superhero movie in recent memory stars with a completely clueless character who at the same time is a genius and also has this witty side to them so they always have some quick comrback leaning on the comedic side. Most of it wasn't funny as is with most superhero movies.I could have predicted how this movie would play out which means I could have watched it in my heard rather than buying a ticket to see it. I honestly just want the superhero films to stop at this point. The industry has been over saturated with these films and they all just appear to be carbon copies of each other.","

"alindsayal","25 August 2023","DC is in a bit of a flux right now as they are between the end of DCEU and the start of the new DCU, but we have Blue Beetle now and I saw it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man become combined with an alien scarab that gives him special powers, this causes him to be hunted down by nefarious enemies.Main Character
Xolo Mariduena has been a young actor mainly known for his really good work on Cobra Kai. He plays Jaime Reyes here and he is great in the role. He brings plenty of vibrance to the role of Jaime and he nails the emotional scenes too. This is just a really likeable main character and I thought he did a really good job of being a lead for a character that I am pretty sure the majority of mainstream viewers no very little about.Supporting Characters
This has a large group of supporting characters and some of them work, some of them don't. Bruna Marquenzie plays Jenny Kord and is a big ally to Jaime Reyes, she was good in the film and I liked the chemistry between the two of them. It was nothing special, but it worked in this film and I think she has a pretty decent future ahead of her.This story really focuses on family, the main one being the Reyes family and all of them do a fantastic job in really building that bond. George Lopez is probably my favourite as his uncle and he provided the most laughs in the film. But all of them were great in their roles.But the villains of this film fell flat for me. Susan Sarandon plays Victoria Kord and she is just really dull, she doesn't really add much to this role. It's not that she is terrible or anything like that it is just she is the most forgettable part of the film. They try to give the other villain Carapax some character but it is way too late to get the impact that I think people wanted.Story
The best thing I can say about the story is that it is pretty functional. It does a good job with the Reyes family and how their bond strengthens Jaime and his ability as Blue Beetle with this linked to Jenny and her family it works too. But this is a really generic story, it would have been way better if it came out 15 years ago but we have seen everything here before in other films. It tries something towards the end of the film to rise it up but it doesn't quite work and makes the film feel a bit cheesy and predictable.Script
The script is okay, there is some decent humour and drama in there that makes this an entertaining watch. But sometimes, the humour feels a bit forced, I mean it feels like some of the weaker MCU films with comedy that doesn't quite work. The drama also is a mixed bag with some of it not really working in the context that they want.Style
The film looks pretty good. I like the design of the Blue Beetle suit, especially with it being a mostly practical suit, the film has some real exuberant colour and feel to it which is really great to see. Though, as I kind of mentioned before, the pacing and structure of the film doesn't quite work and is quite generic with a few lacklustre action scenes.Overall
Overall, Blue Beetle is an above average film. This is an entertaining watch, especially for a new character on the big screen, but it plays it pretty safe and never does enough to push itself into a better film. If you are interested in this film then I would say give it a chance, just don't expect the next Dark Knight.Rating - 6/10.","

"Cinema-reviewer321","21 September 2023","I know enough about the Blue Beetle character from the comics to understand his origin in the movie, like who the character Jaime Reyes is and what the scarab that is the Blue Beetle suit; being interested in that they made a movie on the character. The DC movie Blue Beetle (2023) was fun and entertaining to watch, though it can be by the numbers when it comes to main antagonists, the main character and the actor playing the main character is what makes the me worth watching. Plus, along with the rest of the cast the movie is funny and like the comics it is based on.Actor Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle was great as the character; he was likable, funny, and you root for him either going up against the main villain or dealing with money problems/finding a job after graduating from a university. The rest of Jaime Reyes's family was funny, played by great actors, and I liked how Jaime Reyes and his family worked together to deal with any problem that gets in their way; one of the family members that were especially funny was George Lopez as Jaime Reyes's uncle Rudy Reyes. Working with Jaime Reyes to keep the scarab away from the villain is Jenny Kord played by Bruna Marquezine who is the daughter of Ted Kord (the second Blue Beetle); I also thought she did a decent job and worked well with Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle.One of the antagonists is Victoria Kord played by Susan Sarandon who is good in the movie, but she is a standard villain who wants the scarab for some sort of super soldier army she is creating because she runs Ted Kord's company because she is his sister. The other antagonist that works with Victoria Kord is Carapax played by Raoul Max Trujillo who is this super soldier she tested on and uses him to fight Blue Beetle, this character does have a backstory of some kind that is revealed at one point, so you know how he got like his now. The villains could have been better, but around that the movie can be entertaining with its action scenes, references to the comics, and a main character you like following.The Blue Beetle scarab looked cool, and I love that the suit is an actual practical effects suit with added CGI that blends very well making it cool to watch in the action sequences that are well done. The action scenes were nicely shot, with it not having a lot of cuts but instead having nice long shots where you can see the actor doing the stunts. The movie has stuff from the comics that people will notice if they know the comics, and the family aspect to the movie was enjoyable to watch, along with this being the first Mexican superhero that does a respectable job representing the culture and how Jaime Reyes and his family interact in their own way which was cool to see in this DC movie.Blue Beetle (2023) was a fun DC movie that I would recommend watching even if you do not know much about the character and comic books he comes from; though the antagonists and the plot might seem like something we have seen before, but Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle played by Xolo Maridueña makes the movie worth watching because he is a likable character. The movie was funny, it had good performances from the actors, great action, nice cinematography, and great effects on the scarab and Blue Beetle suit when using the many weapons that it can create making it entertaining; I would give this a watch when you can.","

"GomezAddams666","20 August 2023","In the midst of the DC inside turmoil and the SAG-AFTRA, WGA strikes, Angel Manuel Soto had to promote the movie he directed without any of its actors, and after the great disappointment that The Flash was, Warner Brothers Discovery needed a good movie to lift themselves up, and they succeeded admirably.Xolo Maridueña is perhaps better known as Miguel Diaz on Netflix's Cobra Kai, but he also excels at brining Jaime Reyes to life. Maridueña is a very charming and talented actor, who has proven he could lead an entire movie. His boy-ish naivete helps him melt into Jaime, a recent College Graduate that needs to find a job to support his family.This job hunt leads Jaime into the Kord family war, but more specifically to Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine).Jenny wants to prevent her aunt Victoria Kord from harnessing alien power in order to create indestructible and unbeatable mercenaries. That alien technology has been in their family for decades, and it is one that Jenny's father, Ted Kord studied most of his life until his disappearance.The Scarab is a sentient being that once it chooses its host, it provides them with an exoskeleton that can withstand many attacks ad create whatever weapon the host can imagine.But of course, what comic book movie would be complete without a villain? And this film has two.The first one being Ignacio Carapax (Raoul Max Trujillo), a Guatemalan soldier recruited as a child to fight communist in the area, and who also became the first test subject of the OMAC, which is a suit powered by the Scarab, and its name means One-Man Army Corps. Producing this in mass to the United States Government would be a great win for Kord Industries and its CEO, Victoria Kord.Carapax however is not a one-note villain. We can see that he lost his mother due to civil unrest in Guatemala, and as mentioned before he was recruited as a child by the United States into becoming a weapon to fight communism. He is a tragic villain, one that you can feel sympathy for.But the undisputable villain here is Victoria Kord. Played by the ever-amazing Susan Sarandon, Victoria is a woman with a vision.Victoria and her father created Kord industries from the ground, they created a company that would manufacture weapons of mass destruction, and she would even go into countries affected by them to report on the success of their terrible merchandise.But when her father passed away, he left the company to Victoria's brother, Ted Kord, which infuriated Victoria into a corporate takeover once Ted disappeared out of thin air, and having the Scarab in her hands would not only mean her father was wrong, but she would also stop at nothing to harness its powers, even if it means killing children or entire families ""for the greater good"".Under less-capabale hands a character like Victoria Kord could have easily be cartoonish in a James Bond villan-esque kind of way, but Sarandon is amazingly scary in the role, which she does not allow to go into camp territory.Blue Beetle has a great supporting cast in the Reyes family, with actors such as George Lopez, Damián Alcázar, Adriana Barraza, Elipidia Carrillo and Belissa Escobedo as Jaime's sister, Milagro.Not only do I bring it up because they are amazing actors, but also because their presence makes the movie that much better.This film is about a reluctant Latino hero who gets his strength from the love of his family, it is an emotional roller coaster from beginning to end, and as I mentioned at the beginning Xolo Mardueña is amazing on every scene he's in.The director of Blue Beetle, Angel Manuel Soto has given DC fans the hero we need in these times of uncertainty. This was perhaps the absolute best comic book movie I have seen in years.","

"mharpesr","18 November 2023","The is a remake of The Greatest American Hero. The hero is usable to grasp the power and control of the gift he has received. Consequently his family loses everything and the hero can't help them until the very end. The majority of the movie is the hero dolting about making grunting and groaning noises whining about his predicament. His sister is a self entitled fool that you feel like choking after the fiset 10 minutes. I was amazed at the poor direction and inconsistency. If your about 4 years old or there abouts, this movie is probably for you. But if your expecting something like Iron Man or Spider-Man you will be sadly disappointed.","

"cherold","6 January 2024","It's hard to know where to begin with the problems of Blue Beetle, but I'll offer a few examples.* It's mainly a family sitcom for the first half hour. After a brief, unintriguing scene with Susan Sarandon we meet a nice family who joke and argue and face challenges and it just goes on and on.* The sitcom format adapts poorly to the actual events. This is most obvious in the first superhero transformation, which is a body-horror moment played as silly comedy. It's weirdly incongruent to combine someone going through an objectively terrifying moment as though it's a very special episode about getting your first zit.* The action is unacceptable. I mean, sometimes very mediocre superhero movies will still have one or two knock-out action sequences, but not this one.Some people say the public is beginning to weary of superhero movies, and movies like this will do nothing to change that.","

Starting from the corky colors going through the terrible script to the unbelievably bad acting.The plot is not original in any way. You can vaguely see what the creators were going for but they ended up with bits and pieces of scenes that look too familiar to another superhero film(s) accompanied with some of the worst CGI work of the year..
I was mostly annoyed throughout the whole film..
No idea who would find this film amusing!My rating is 3/10 for the good performance from Raoul Trujillo and some good camera movement work in a couple of scenes.","

"eddie_baggins","27 September 2023","An up and coming director, a bright young star in his first major Hollywood leading role, a move from a direct to streaming release to the wide world of cinema and bought to life in a colourful 80's like sheen, everything appeared to be relatively promising for Blue Beetle to buck the recent DC cinematic trend of dire box office results and middling to poor critical responses but despite some oddly kind reviews, Angel Manuel Soto's newest entry into the comic box landscape is a mostly DOA prospect that loses its charm well before the credits appear.A well-liked if far from commonly popular character in the DC space, Jaime Reyes/Blue Beetle isn't exactly the biggest name brand character they've unleashed on the movie going public and in many ways gave the struggling comic empire a chance to really go for it and deliver something unexpected on willing audiences but despite some early fun and a creative setting in the fictional location of Palmera City, Soto's films unique flavour and eclectic cast of characters can't sustain much momentum past the opening 30 - 40 minute mark as it falls into a rather pedestrian ride that offers very little in the way of memorable set pieces or story elements.In some ways sitting a little outside of the usual origin story box that has been opened countless times before in such comic book feature films, Blue Beetle doesn't waste much time early on introducing us to Xolo Maridueña recent college graduate Jaime Reyes and his full of life family (including a scene chewing George Lopez) and before we know it we are off to Kord Industries, overseen by Susan Sarandon's generic CEO baddie Victoria Kord, where who would've guessed it, Reye's unknowingly unlocks an alien power courtesy of a mysterious alien scarab that has chosen him as its earthly host, creating the superhero of Blue Beetle in the process.What follows on from here is all boorishly predictable as the films Latino flavour and exuberance is overshadowed by comic book movie 101 staples that feel like they are at loggerheads with what Blue Beetle was aiming to achieve by breathing fresh life into a stale genre through its use of a culture that has so far not played major roles in the superhero space of the last few decades.The whole affair feels like one of those experiences that was at war within itself to become the film it wanted to be and there are times where Soto's undoubted directional talent is on display, Maridueña's natural charisma shines through and the films 80's essences including The Haxan Cloak's score and Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography gets things feeling like we are heading somewhere really positive and unexpected but too much of Blue Beetle feels like nothing more than a rehashed product hiding under the guise of something more, leading to another missed opportunity for DC who now has a final shot under the leadership of James Gunn to get things right.Final Say -A feature that would've been better off sticking to its streaming release rather than being pushed to the cinema where it has crashed and burned at the box office, Blue Beetle may be hard to hate with its heart in the right place but it's nothing more than another stale and magic free affair DC was hoping it could disguise.2 gun toting grandmas out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

The plot is bad, one-color, too predictable, I could already imagine how the movie would play out after just watching the first few minutes. The main character is stupid, weak, needs an event to strengthen him, there are too many of this type of plot. 2023 Does DC still think many people will like this type of movie?. The power of friendship, the power of family is like a Japanese shounen.What is the villain's motive?. What a terrible movie.I spent 2 hours watching this nonsense.

"The-Sarkologist","15 December 2023","Well, this happens to be another one of those superhero films in a world that seems to be awash with superhero films. In fact, it seems to have landed up in the transition between the old DCEU and the new DCU. Yeah, there seems to be a lot of these multi-film universes. The problem that I find with a lot of these superhero films that that you need to have an origin story, and then have a vague example of a plot as well. The other thing is that they seem to be trying to build up a catalogue of non-white/non-male superheros. In this instance we have a Mexican superhero.One of the good things about this film is that it gives us an insight into the world of the latin-American minority in the US. Like, we have the kid who comes back from college yet the only job he can get is cleaning the house of the main antagonist. There is also the idea that the world of the immigrant (particularly the illegal-immigrant) and the world of the the successful white people. Then there is also the idea that one health issue can bankrupt a family, and being caught up in an unpredictable rental market.However, while there are some interesting aspects to the film, it is really just fairly typical of your average superhero film. Like, we have the artifact that turns the user into a superhero, and that the artifact will basically choose who they wish to give the abilities to. Mind you, there is also the corporate boss that wants the artifact to basically control the world, or at least make themselves really really rich.Well, okay, there were some good things about this film, and there is also that foreshadowing at the beginning of the film about the poor boy being lifted out of poverty through the support of a wealthy patron. As is typical with this type of film, there is also a romantic development between the superhero. Mind you, there is also the suggestion that there was an older Blue Beetle who seemed to be another one of those ultra-rich individuals who decided to become a superhero.Yeah, as I said, it wasn't a bad film, and I did like the concept of exploring the struggles of the immigrants in modern America, but not even that but how harsh and unforgiving life the United States can be. However, we also have this ironic thing that they happen to be rescued from poverty by an angel which, sadly, doesn't happen all that often. As I said, yeah, as a film it wasn't bad, and I enjoyed it, but there wasn't much depth to it beyond that.","

"KenKenReviews","19 August 2023","The highlight of this film is its heart. To do that they made the whole family central to the movie which then made Jaime not feel so much like a main character despite having the suit. There were some big characters that happen to over shadow him. Nana Reyes was hilarious and the MVP alongside Rudy Reyes. So, it added and took away from the film, if that makes sense. I got a bit teary eyed I can admit. The mix of English and Spanish really drove the authenticity of the emotional scenes. They were centred around grief, loss and pain. They were few and they were impactful. Throwing some throw backs in to compliment the past Blue Beetles was pretty cool too.","

"kayraurn","20 January 2024","First things first, Puerto Rican director Angel Manuel Soto doesn't break any new ground in terms of exploring the superhero genre in Blue Beetle. He and screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer stick to the A-Z formula of a superhero origin story. We have a young, down-on-his-luck protagonist (sounds familiar?). Then, his life takes an unexpected turn when he finds himself unwittingly becoming a superhero. He's reluctant, confused and has to face a bigger problem compared to what he has experienced in the past.And yet, the familiarity of the story has the added advantage of being the first Latino-led superhero movie. The good news is, Angel Manuel Soto, doesn't confine it as a mere, surface-level novelty factor. He treats it with respect by delving deep into the Latino culture, particularly in the importance of family relations and values seen in the Reyes.The Reyes in Blue Beetle is an immigrant family struggling to make a living in the poor neighbourhood of Palmera City. When the movie first introduced the Reyes, they are already in a dire financial situation. They are about to lose their home after Kord Industries decided to raise the rent to an exorbitant level. The only glimmer of hope right now is their adult son, Jaime (Xolo Maridueña), a pre-law graduate who just returns home to reunite with his family. He finds out about the problem and his dad's (Damián Alcázar) health condition. He's eager to ease the family burden by hoping to land a lucrative job, only to end up settling with menial work alongside his younger sister, Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) as a maintenance and cleaning crew.The family dynamics angle gives the otherwise formulaic superhero movie a much-needed heart and soul. It's hard not to root for the likeable, tight-knit family like the Reyes such as Jaime's wacky and eccentric Uncle Rudy (George Lopez in a scene-stealing supporting role) and his beloved Nana played by the equally hilarious Adriana Barraza.Jaime's journey from being a nobody to a superhero may have been the same old superhero-movie cliches. But at least his story resonates well, thanks to Xolo Maridueña's charismatic and sympathetic lead performance. He shares great chemistry with the rest of the supporting cast playing the Reyes family members and so does he and Bruna Marquezine together.The latter plays Jenny Kord, the daughter of the late Ted Kord who founded Kord Industries before her scheming aunt, Victoria (the long-missed Susan Sarandon, who's clearly having fun chewing the scenery) takes over the business. Marquezine nails Jenny's spunky personality while her magnetic charm helps a lot in elevating her performance.Bruna Marquezine (middle) plays Jenny Kord in ""Blue Beetle"" (2023)Back to the story, Victoria is the one who found the mechanised alien artefact in the form of a blue scarab. Her goal is to draw an unlimited superpower from the scarab to activate her military-based creation of high-tech supersoldiers. Upon discovering her motive, Jenny tries to stop her by stealing the scarab. She subsequently entrusted the scarab to Jaime, who has no idea the level of trouble he's getting himself into. The scarab somehow chose Jaime as its host, where it embedded itself into his spine and even have him automatically equipped in a full-body armoured suit. He is also granted various powers and superhuman strength, complete with an inner voice (Becky G) known as Khaji-Da controlling and telling him what to do.Despite this being Angel Manuel Soto's first major big-budget Hollywood production, he manages to make good use of its reported US$120 million budget (believe it or not, Blue Beetle was originally slated for straight-to-Max streaming). The CGI isn't the greatest but decent enough without looking patchy and inferior (here's looking at you, The Flash). The director also showcased his excellent flair for well-choreographed action set pieces as he successfully brings Blue Beetle's multiple superpowers to life. Whether it was his impressive physical agility or taking down the bad guys with different types of weapons (one of them includes the heavily-promoted Final Fantasy VII video game reference), it's hard not to get immersed by Blue Beetle's superhero abilities.Blue Beetle also benefits from Bobby Krlic's catchy, '80s-style synthesiser score and an equally cool soundtrack. The movie even has a field day with its pop-culture references from the 1995 classic telenovela Maria la del Barrio to the superhero parody series of El Chapulín Colorado. Given the less-than-stellar results of Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash, it's nice to see a DC movie, albeit an unlikely one like Blue Beetle is back on track. Several shortcomings aside such as Raoul Max Trujillo's one-note performance as Victoria's main enforcer, Conrad Carapax and the tedious third act, Blue Beetle remains a surprisingly entertaining, funny and heartfelt little package of a summer-movie blockbuster.","

"martinpersson97","24 November 2023","The DCU is, of course, rather hit and miss, and in many ways somewhat of a worse ripoff of the Marvel films.This one, however, is definitely a standout and one of the better. Which is not to say it is an incredible film, of course. It does suffer from some of the similar issues of the other films, but overall it is a pretty good and fun action adventure.The effects are pretty good, though at the same time somewhat obvious CGI in some scenes - and it features some pretty neat cinematography, cutting and editing.The actors all do a good job at conveying it. The villain, in typical fashion, remains somewhat underdeveloped, but this is of course not the first time that has happened.Overall, I would say this is a recommended DC film, in the same vein of The Flash or Wonder Woman. It works as a pretty good adventure overall, if one of the last of the old DCU.","

"sgguru","19 November 2023","The sound effects were about 3 seconds out of sync. Punches swing, wait for it..... sound effects of the hit come eons later. And what language were the actors speaking, Japanese? Russian? Certainly, Spanish words are being spoken but don't even sync with lip movements. They did a better job with Raymond Burr's dubbing over Japanese Godzilla in the 1950's. Whole family acts like idiots chanting and jumping around trying to get Jaime (hero) to open the box with the Scarab in it. Pathetic acting all around. If any of these actors thought that they were doing justice to their Mexican heritage, sorry they failed. I'm surprised that Susan Sarandon was so desperate as to lower herself to (act?) in this atrocity. Don't waste 2 hours of your life, watching this, even on MAX. O yeah, the ending kiss where Jaime's blue beetle legs pop out and go erect, is one sick overdone joke, and the family taunts clearly was the icing on the cake for this reviewer.","

But I wanted to give Blue Beetle the benefit of the doubt and I'm glad I did.Jaime (Cobra Kai's Xolo Mariduena) a college graduate tries to help his family that are struggling, by taking a job for a rich company, but ends up getting attached to a alien device titled the Scarab, and becomes the superhero Blue Beetle. Will Jaime embrace the hero he was destined to be?Better DC movie than The Flash. But I must say Blue Beetle has a lot of heart to it, not just making Blue Beetle the main focus, but making the other characters shine as well. Even scene stealers like George Lopez and Susan Sarandon. The effects are really good, and has awesome superhero battles. I hope to see more Blue Beetle films in the future.","

I am all up for an hispanic hero, but to try and make humour of their family culture and turn the family into a charictature of stereotype. Why not just focus on the main character. We do not need to know that he is living in poverty, it is just so paint by numbers. I believe if this came out in the 90s it would of been a blockbuster. Nothing in this feels original. It is like Venom, but in neon pink and blue. More of the same. I do not want more of the same any more. The rest of the world does not want more of the same. So why do they serve us this? Ditch the stereotyping, the humour, tone it down.","

"SAMTHEBESTEST","17 August 2023","Blue Beetle (2023) :
Movie Review -Blue Beetle Review: DC Studios latest superhero drama, Blue Beetle, marks Ángel Manuel Soto's debut in the superhero genre. DC has been looking to turn the tide for a while and has had a few impressive successes recently, especially with Joker and The Batman. Blue Beetle is fresh stuff, alright, but does it really matter if superhero theories are old? A new suite and powers are enough? I guess Not. It's not just DC; Marvel too is suffering from an insufficiency of new conflicts and thrills. It's just that earlier we used to get one or two superhero movies a year; now we get a lot of them, and that too after watching so much stuff already. Blue Beetle is funny with Mexican humour-that's new! The suit, theme, and powers are also quite new. Though the film lacks newness in storytelling. We all know how one gets power and tries to use it while tackling dangers, doing romance, and saving family. Blue Beetle is that mixture again, with some tech talk we have been seeing from Iron Man, Wayne, and Hulk for years. Nevertheless, it's a promising start for a new superhero, if that's what you're looking for.The film begins with Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returning home after graduation, and he learns that his family is gonna lose the house in Palmera City. He is fired from a job by Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon) while trying to save Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine) amidst an argument. Jenny might have a job for him, and he visits Kord's office to meet her. Jenny gives him a Scarab to protect, which is childishly opened by his family. Jaime is now chosen to become a symbiotic host to the Scarab, an ancient alien biotechnological relic that grants him a powerful exoskeleton armour, turning him into the superhero ""Blue Beetle"". Victoria and her bodyguard robot, Conrad (Raoul Max Trujillo) are after the code of Blue Beetle, which jointly puts Jaime's family in danger. Jaime and Kha-Ji must work together to protect the family and the code, but will it be enough?Coming as a fresh film, Blue Beetle has no load of expectations. So even if it's underwhelming at parts, it still doesn't bother you much. It can't be the same when you watch The Batman or Superman movies because they are hugely popular superheroes and their films come with certain baggage. The screenplay of Blue Beetle is the main concern, as it deals with new ideas in old ways. It's 2023, and we are still being fed two decades-old conflicts. Why? The building collapses, but the Hero wouldn't be hurt, or even the heroine, even if there is large destruction right around her. One of the family members must get hurt so that the Hero can get angry and unleash his powers. In no time, the hero and heroine would come close to kissing each other, and someone would enter the room. Don't you dare ask when they fell in love. It's just there. Don't tell me you haven't been familiar with all these things, because if you are not, Blue Beetle is going to feed all of them for the first time. But if you have tasted them before, then this might get you away from the table in no time.The handsome Xolo Maridueña will be the girls favourite soon, at least as a crush. He has that personality and kindness in his natural role as Jaime Reyes. But as Blue Beetle, he is still immature. That's what the course of his character demands, by the way. Raoul Max Trujillo has been pretty impressive as the antagonist here. He might have only a few scenes to show his face and act, but he is damn good there. The female baddie played by Susan Sarandon didn't look evil at all, but you know why. It's just that female touch that makes things difficult for her. Jaime's love interest, Bruna Marquezine, is cute but nothing that can be remembered or even discussed. Surprisingly, all the family members of Jaime seem to have a blast. Damián Alcázar, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, and Belissa Escobedo have rocked more as a unit than as individuals. Harvey Guillén's Sanchez goes unnoticed until before the last lines, when he speaks in Mexican.Talking about the visual effects, Blue Beetle is your old laser show put together with high-tech weapons. Some of the destruction scenes look grand on the big screen without any 3D effects. The cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski is fine, whereas Craig Alpert's edit keeps the crispness intact. Technically, it's a well-made film, no doubt, considering the $120 million budget. The studio took good care of the production design, as nothing really looked outdated or ugly here. However, Blue Beetle needed a little brainstorming on the paper, which is clearly missing. Of course, you don't expect a typical superhero entertainer to be a smart and intelligent film, but what's wrong with being a bit more clever? Ángel Manuel Soto's storytelling is well-versed in your regular superhero flicks that you have been enjoying over the years. He makes you a simple popcorn entertainer when the world is getting more advanced with multiverses and emotionally powerful tales. Could he have done better? Yes, I guess so. Blue Beetle isn't a bad film at all, but it isn't great enough to be recommended. It's just a matter of your expectations, whether you want to go for it desperately or not. But yes, it can be viewed once for a fresh attempt in the money-spinning genre.RATING - 5/10*","

"heyb-03044","21 August 2023","I just saw Blue Beetle, and I did not really like it that much, I enjoyed the first 40 minutes, and some 10 minutes towards the end, but everything else just felt like the same stuff we have seen thousands of times, I was pretty board throughout the movie, and I did not really care about most of what was going on, there was one seen that I thought was pretty cool, and I do like the more emotional moments in the movie, but overall, I was really bored and waiting for it to end, I think I should mention that I do not like superhero movies, which could be part of the reason why I did not like this movie, and if you like superhero movies, then you might like Blue Beetle, because it is like every superhero movie ever, if you have seen a superhero movie, you have seen Blue Beetle, overall, I give this a 5/10, a boring movie that I might recommend if you like superhero films, but just not for me.","

"mark_edwards_is","21 September 2023","I don't feel like it's a great concept, I'm not familiar withe the source material and to be honest I don't really feel like it's a good film, seems like it exists to tick a few boxes for people with agendas, not very original, feels like a spiderman rip off, can't really rate it, it's predictable and I my opinion a bit boring, if there was a sequel I doubt I would watch it. For a DC film it's a hit disappointing, I just don't understand why they would think this story would be appealing to any audience except the small audience it is aiming to please. There's probably a reason I haven't heard of this superhero before!","

"hengtheslinger","22 August 2023","The 3 stars that I gave are entirely for the Blue Beetle suit and power concept. Plotwise, it's so so so terrible, cliche, and cringey. I could predict almost everything, this movie seems like a copy of Shang-Chi, even the jokes 🙄.The main character is so dumb, stupid, and cringey, he could've used the power to his advantage, but even with power, he still looks like powerless dude who needs constant helps from ordinary people, when others kill his family ruthlessly, he still couldn't muster up courage to kill the enemy, he's a stupid and cringey coward.The side characters are also cliche and cringey. He just has that one family member who constantly looka for troubles.The villains are right up super cringey. Nothing is new except for power concept (it's actually nothing surprising but looks kinda cool), the writing is just down right bad. The shooting itself is also SMH, as always, DC movies are always shot without lights, and it's hard to watch for some parts(especially the part they fight in the air).It could be a somewhat acceptable movie if it was released over 10 years ago, but I doubt the writer could make it good, after all, he still copied from other movies now.","

The intro is tooooooo long and the characters is so confusing have no idea what they doing or even should do. The story is just messed up. Also -3 point for the sister I guess they want to make they character hilarious but its end up with so annoying. The family's character is just a character its not even feel real like its so movie. The love scene is just weird too fast don't even get why suddenly. Also the Rudy is weird why he is suddenly so smart why suddenly and make tech or even get everything like a scientist. Everything is suck the worst movie I seen this year so far. I expect more! DC!! And the dad story line is just what what what not even near to the reality I mean I understand its a movie but Its just suck I don't even feel related. For other fantasy movie more real lol. Hopeless for the characters. Not fun Not interesting Not hilarious Old joke also i low key the joke is similar to shazam. This whole thing is just sad.","

"OnlyAtJMart","18 August 2023","So with the superhero genre turning out quite a bit of disappointment, my expectations weren't high going into this. While it was better than I expected, they could have made it great, and set it apart from every other superhero story. The family dynamic was good, but there's a lot of corny jokes, just like every coming of age superhero movie. They could have made it more serious and dramatic. They should have explored the suits abilities more. They could have made a better villain. They could have tried something other than the same old ""going up against someone with similar powers but they are evil/brainwashed"" trope. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, but it's definitely not going to change any minds about the genre.","

"jtags-84059","24 September 2023","First of all if you're going to do a long movie it needs to be interesting for most parts. There is so much time wasting scenes in this movie it gets extremely boring. The character are either screaming, whining or making unfunny jokes. The 'hero' is pretty pathetic and whiny the whole way through. Gets superhero powers and starts whining and complaining that his life is changed forever. Get a grip! Anyone in that situation would be pretty happy with that situation. Also whoever cast the 'villain' lady needs to be fired. About as threatening as Blue Beetles granny. Was surprised they didn't have a boss battle with the two granny's at the end.","

"alvarez_milan","26 August 2023","I liked Xolo as the Beetle. The actual Beetle parts were good. Not the usual soundtrack for DC movies, but a good one. I also liked the connection with the ""original"" beetle.Sadly the whole ""Latin humor"" was too much, and the ""familia"" stuff was distracting and exaggerated. As a Mexican, I understood all the references, and there were several moments I laughed at the jokes, but got to the point it was just plain ridiculous. Also, the whole thing of the ""abuela"" acting as a ""revolutionary"" it's very anachronistic and grotesque.I like the idea of a ""Hispanic"" hero in the DC Comics universe , but I hope they realize they over did it.Yes the Beetle character in the comics was funny, yes the funny gist worked with Shazam, but in this movie it just went too far. If this is how the Gunn universe is starting... I am not very excited about it.","

"neil-476","24 August 2023","Newly-graduated Jaime Reyes returns to his family, living in a poor section of a city where the wealthy are gradually encroaching. He gets a menial job with his sister Milagro at a hotel, which he promptly loses, fired by Victoria Kord, CEO of Kord Industries. Jaaime was sticking up for Jenny Kord, daughter of missing previous CEO Ted Kord, and she subsequently slips him a mysterious item which Victoria wants back, and she is prepared to get it.As a superhero origin story, this is perhaps fairly routine, albeit perfectly functional and a decent enough story in its own right - someone trying to cope with new tech which is beyond their experience is a well-worn trope, but with plenty of scope for humour, for instance. But Jaime's family add a lot of texture and heart to this movie. They are nicely and strongly characterised, and there are some great and emotional moments featuring them. They are not strictly necessary to the plot, arguably, but they strongarm their way in and demand a place.If I have a criticism of this film, it is that there is a lot of dialogue in subtitled Spanish. I have no problem with this, and it's a good thing that a big-budget super-hero movie is built around a heavily Hispanic character/cast, but I know there is a not insignificant chunk of audience who dislike reading subtitles. So, on the one hand maybe this is restricting the film's audience. On the other, Everything Everywhere All At Once, right?","

I'm familiar enough with this version of the blue beetle to be overjoyed with its presentation on the big screen.This could not have gone any better, in fact it was design to be what it was, and it worked.It's not an Epic they are trying to make a billion dollars off of. I'm sure that would be nice and all, but it was really good to see a movie in the DC Extended Universe that perfectly fit into that without the pressure of having to be epic.It was a cool film that allowed itself to have fun and because of that I had so much fun watching it,

"fredschaefer-406-623204","20 August 2023","What was once known as the DCEU (the DC Comics Extended Universe) is rapidly coming to an end, and for most fans it is definitely with a whimper. Its fate was sealed earlier this year when Warner Brothers announced that director James Gunn had been hired to reboot the entire DC superhero line starting with a new Superman film due to be released in 2025. The remaining projects were pretty much up the creek as far as fans were concerned, as they essentially represented a dead end universe. One of the those films was the big screen debut of the Jamie Reyes's incarnation of the Blue Beetle, a super hero whose roots go back a long way to Charlton comics, and whose suit has been worn by more than one hero.So, separating BLUE BEETLE from all the bad vibes surrounding it, is the film any good? For me, it is a qualified ""yes,"" starting with the basic plot, which is a pretty rote by the numbers superhero origin story. A piece of alien tech in the form of a scarab, which, naturally is coveted by a weapons manufacturing corporation, bonds with a recent college graduate named Jamie Reyes, forming a symbiotic relationship and giving him a suit of armor that bestows Jamie with some pretty awesome, though ill defined, powers. He's basically a Green Lantern, except he's Blue, and he's not part of any corp. The first third of the film sets up the circumstances of how the alien tech falls into the hero's hands; the middle section has him transform into the Blue Beetle and go through a learning curve with his powers; the finale has Jamie captured by the evil Kord Industries, who wants what he took from them back, but the challenge is overcome with the help of Jamie's family and new girlfriend. Any comic book fan will recognize the plot turns and character beats from any number of classic origin stories, be they DC or Marvel.What gives BLUE BEETLE some juice and sets it apart from some other recent DCEU and MCU films is that it really has a lot heart, and was clearly made by people who liked and respected the character, and was true to the core of what made him popular. Director Angel Manuel Soto and screen writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer have given the story a very distinct Latin flavor, and infused it with a POV from that culture, which gives it a certain energy which makes it stand apart. The main supporting cast consists of Jamie's loyal and loving extended family, which consists of his parents, sister, grand-mother, and a wacky uncle who has no filter. At times it feels as if the family scenes are right out of a sitcom, especially when George Lopez's Uncle Rudy says anything. And one might be forgiven for thinking that the loud and boisterous Latin family has become a real trope. Still, it's a different track for a super hero film and it works, and tropes are not necessarily bad when they are used with sincerity. Jamie's scenes with his family really are the best part of the film. It's diversity without it feeling like box-checking marketing. Another thing I liked was the absence of the kind of snarky humor that has invaded a lot of films over in the MCU (best example being THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER), this film has plenty of humor, and though not all of it works, it's not annoying, and not a deal breaker.Which leaves a lot that is average at best, starting with the CGI, of which there is a lot of in this film, along with big helping of comic book logic-like when Uncle Rudy is just able to sit down and hack into one of Kord Industries computers just because he has ""skills."" The Big Bad of the film is Victoria Kord, played by Susan Sarandon, and she is not very good playing the kind of one dimensional CEO villain (another trope) that has been a part of popular culture for decades, especially since the Great Recession. Sarandon is given some very unsubtle and clunky dialogue designed to show just how rapaciously villainous she is, though Raoul Max Trujillo as her main enforcer, Carapax, manages to project some Danny Trejo in his prime menace. There are the usual shallow jabs at capitalism and colonialism that are worked into every comic book film these days. And there are a few moments that made my eyes roll, as when the grand-mother, played by Adriana Barraza, wields a machine gun as if she was Jesse Ventura in PREDATOR. The scene where Xolo Mariduena's Jamie transforms feels like it was lifted right out of VENOM, and when we are shown how his armor works from his POV, it resembles similar scenes from IRON MAN.I do wonder if the character of Blue Beetle would have been better if introduced in something like a YOUNG JUSTICE film, though there is little chance that a project like that would be green lighted as Warner Brothers these days. I do agree with those who have suggested that BLUE BEETLE probably would have been a blockbuster if it had been made a decade ago before its type of superhero story had been run into the ground. James Gunn has said the character will be part of his DCU going forward and that is certainly possible as Superman, Batman, and The Flash are mentioned in passing, thus firmly establishing that Jamie Reyes exists in a DC Universe, maybe one that is yet to be defined. I definitely think the film benefited by not having any other DC heroes make fan service cameos-there is a mid-credits scene, but it concerns a plot thread that is firmly set inside the Blue Beetle story canon.All in all, I think BLUE BEETLE has a tighter story than THE FLASH, a much firmer grip on its title hero than BLACK ADAM, and it has to be way better than SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, which I didn't bother to see. If it the better DC super hero film of the last few years, than that is only because the bar has been set low. Still, Xolo Mariduena's Jamie Reyes, and his alter ego, deserves another shot no matter what the final fate of this film may be.","

Maybe it's because I don't have much of a family but holy Hannah, could they make the family members any more obnoxious? Terrible directing, terrible acting even from Susan Sarandon. I enjoyed, always do, Raoul Trujillo but he couldn't carry the whole movie.To me it felt like the movie was one big chaotic, stereotypical mess. The story I liked and I hoped that it would be good but DC can't figure out how to make a good movie for anyone other than a 12 year old audience.DC needs to go to Marvel's office and take serious notes, stop turning good stories into awful movies.

When Peter Parker realise he could shoot webs, he was ecstatic!!Warner brothers should just give their rights away to someone who will actually respect DC. Even a guy in a comic shop could create something better than this...Such a shame.","

"viviancym90","20 August 2023","Never written any review but I just had to for this one. I felt asleep halfway through the movie in cinema. First of all, actors are poorly casted especially blue beetle himself, from start to end his acting cringed me to the bone. Everyone else speaks like train, even when those scenes where you're supposed to have deeper emotions, to empathise with the characters' stories and feelings...but all of them speak without much emotions and pauses like they never process some feelings first before they speak/act. I wanted to see actions from protagonist but this film decided to go with family troop kind of avengers fighting they way out instead. This feels like a combination of spider man and hulk, but the plot is below average IMO. Was expecting a better performance from Susan Sarandon well at least she's the only one I know from the entire movie but her villain evil side wasn't played out well. Don't waste your time unless you just need to watch a movie to kill time.","

In a sea of tired, CGI-filled cameo-fests that are only focused on building out their multiverses than telling a good story... Blue Beetle is a refreshing reminder of why we fell in love with comic book films in the first place. Yes, it is a blend of Iron Man (the suit & powers), Spider-Man (the character), and Ms Marvel (the family dynamic)... but it just works so well. It's a little too silly and cringe at times with a somewhat cliche story, but it's just so charming and has so much heart you can't help but enjoy it!

The story could have easily been from any straight to DVD kids superhero movie you'd find in at a truck stop. It's so bad that you end up not caring about the characters or what's happening because your not a 5yo child who is mesmerized by the bright colors and fight scenes. I'm not sure if that was what the movie was meant to be or if the marketing was off but it misses the mark when compared to other DC superhero movies. For those that rated a 10 I would recommend ""Shark boy and lava girl"" that seems like something you'd enjoy.","

"carlos-pires","29 September 2023","The most ridiculous super-hero ever. Full of clichés, but a fun watch with great pacing and a great ending.For starters, this is apparently a super-hero for Mexicans (Hispanics, eventually? Sorry: I can't never get my head around American race wars). It's only natural that global conglomerates finally start to act locally (remember the ""think global, act local"" motto from the 1990's?...) However, everything in the story was either started or developed by Americans (Ted Kord - the good brother, and Susan Sarandon's character - the bad sister)... which means that although it LOOKS made for Mexicans, it kind'a has a ""colonialist"" after-taste.Anyway, if I was a Mexican I would feel deeply insulted by the depiction of this caricature of a Mexican family, as it's wrong in so many ways (from the multiple instances of embarrassing public behavior of the whole family to the depiction of the grandma in the brink of an orgasm while shooting people with what looks like a Nintendo version of a Gatling gun).Anyway, let's get into specifics.First of all, the whole saga starts off with the all-too-common unwitting-and-unwilling hero who is at the wrong place at the wrong time. Fine... But there is a little twist in it: his fat sister with eyeglasses (a double cliché) is the stupid one who actually starts everything. She's the one responsible for effing up her brother's homecoming with bad news (when explicitly told by everyone else in the family NOT to do it), then goes on to get herself and her brother fired because she wanted to take a dump in the boss's toilet (?!), then she acts like a child and manages to unleash this alien drone that goes up her brother's behind and gets the whole story in motion... then later she's the one responsible for their dad's fatal heart attack! Somehow, nobody cares that this stupid chick just screws everything up.On the other end of the racial+social spectrum, the rich girl is always saying ""Sorry! Sorry!"" even though she didn't do anything wrong and explicitly told the dude to not mess with the effing scarab in the first place...
Is this the current zeitgeist? Are we, as viewers, supposed to think that it is OK to be a dimwit who ruins everything if you are a girl? A poor girl? A fat girl? A girl with glasses? All of the above? Are we supposed to think that anyone who is born into poverty should be excused of everything, from being fired to getting their dad an heart attack (or getting their brother sodomized by an alien drone)? Are we supposed to think that anyone who is born into wealth must be constantly apologizing even to the stupid idiots who screw up everything by ignoring every warning?All this is deeply disturbing if you think about it. I rather not, but I'm still aware of it and I can't avoid mentioning it. But let's move on...More clichés:
1. Nowadays we use tons of software applications that have several deployments per day without the need for a ""reboot"", but still... highly evolved alien technology beyond human comprehension always has to ""reboot"" at some plot point. And it has to take several minutes, so that the bad guys get a fighting chance.2. ""Good"" is always blue, ""bad"" is always red. Hollywood is like paint by numbers.3. The bad guy looks exactly like a Gundam robot or something out of Power Rangers. I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of copyright lawsuits are coming up their way.4. The good guy is such a sucker that he always refuses to shoot to kill, even after seeing his family under live gunfire, and his dad dying. I guess this is supposed to be a ""family movie"", so lethal action is dialed down to a minimum. (although this gets an exception near the end of the movie, which is completely out of character and blatantly just for the sake of that specific plot point...)
5. The ""sentient alien technology"" has a sexy female voice.Bottom line: this is a highly flawed movie, with some disturbing undertones you should be aware of, but it is actually very entertaining due to very good craftsmanship from everyone involved. Particularly, the production design, direction, editing and acting are very good, and the pacing is perfect. Plus, you get a (predictable but) gratifying ending.Regardless of the above criticism, if you're into superhero movies then you surely got to see this one.","

I'm not saying Marvel is perfect or even great, but the things they do well (arguably not consistently so) are character development and dialogue. BB just kicks the bar down to a new low - the humour is witless and crass, the characters behave like cartoons, the plot is uninspiring and predictable, the character development is non-existent, the racial/matriarchal/patriarchal tropes are, well, just really painful, contrived, over-the-top tropes, and there's really nothing human about this film at all.Love at first sight cliché? Check.Dead father meeting you at the gates of hell cliché? Check.Tortured appropriate of Creation of Adam? Check.Spends less than 5 minutes mourning over the death of your father, then rides in a spaceship with the person responsible for it, with a smile on your face? CHECK.This film is a gigantic waste of time. A well deserved bomb at the box office.","

"muhammadjehanzaib","23 September 2023","This is definitely one of the worse DC movie ever, Character development, dialogues, story, whatever you look for in a good movie, it's definitely missing in this one. Totally predictable. May be fine for kids who would be happy to see some colours here and there otherwise this movie has nothing to offer for anyone who is looking to spend some good time. There is no sense in this movie plot. Unnecessary drama, and needlessly prolonged scenes. DC could use some good writers and directors who can present the movie in somewhat better way. I never thought that I would be disappointed this much by any movie.","

"johannes2000-1","25 November 2023","Sure, I had a fine time with this entertaining movie, but in the end it did leave a slight feeling of disappointment and missed opportunities. On the positive side: the story is reasonably involving, the pace is high (when after a slow start the action kicks in), and the CGI is absolutely great. There's lots of humor, and Xolo Maridueña is a sympathetic and good-looking main character Jaime. On the other hand the story is far from original: it's more or less a blueprint of Spiderman's beginnings, with an unsuspecting average teen who gets in a weird way infected, thus becoming to his own amazement a super hero with all kinds of superpowers that he has to learn to control, while at the same time chasing a heinous villain that of course threatens the world. So nothing new there.As said, Jaime is sympathetic, but for the rest his persona is totally blank and nondescript, lacking every inch of character. His family is endearing, but with all their hilarious actions they're made into some kind of slapstick, on the brink of getting tiresome. The romance between innocent clueless Jaime and Jenny (Bruna Marquezine), a worldwise heiress of a business imperium, is totally unrealistic. Susan Sarandon is a fine actress, but for a supervillain she's just too much a nicely dressed old lady, lacking all the exuberant evilness that you expect of a DC villain.In hindsight it all impressed me as a superhero-light, tailored for kids, a bit like a live-action version of a Cartoon Network movie. Nothing wrong with that, and amusing enough, but don't expect anything more or deeper.","

"confirmeddeath","23 September 2023","When you go to a restaurant, there are options.Each option is unique because they know that if all the options are barely different then you'll simply get tired of their food and go somewhere else...These superhero movies by DC and Marvel is the same garbage over and over again. This was a waste of my time.Kid gets superpower and he goes ""Oh no, how do I get rid of this inconvenience, all I wanted was to get a job and work for the rest of my life so I could pay off my debts""
Then after all of that comes the ""Oh no, I'm not a killer"" So now we have to watch a fight between this loser hero beating the same guy 50 times just for the sake of ""action"" because ""action"" supposedly sells...You see, when your family is at risk, there is absolutely nothing you wouldn't do to protect them, but these bs scripts ... I don't know, they are made for imbeciles. Their ""No killing"" bs leads to more people dying, but that's ok because the ""Hero"" is ""innocent"".Aren't people getting tired of this same crap soup over and over again?","

"michelleg-98783","28 August 2023","Reading through these reviews I can tell they're completely missing the point of this movie.. Is this another superhero movie where the main character gets super powers through an alien artifact? Yes. But it goes BEYOND that. All superhero movies value romance and somewhat family but Blue Beetle does it justice when they talk about family.Being Mexican-American myself and growing up in white America this story touched my heart. I saw myself and my family in these characters and our struggles being put up on the big screen. Many people fail to realize that the Mexican community lived for the American dream. Our parents, and grandparents picked up everything they had on their shoulders and left their homes behind in order to find a better life for themselves and their children. Nowadays, the world is fastly changing under our feet and as the rich become richer, we get pushed out as the movie shows.This story is important for representation to our community. It's filled with comedic monologues and objects our community values. We as a Latino community value family over everything, especially living in the U. S. as long as we got family, we can always figure it out. I loved how they tackled the romance, it's not overly pushed in your face, it's gentle and natural how it grows throughout the film.Lastly, the cast was outstanding their dynamic was well put together. Their chemistry was amazing everyone represented an important role and performed great.As my title says this is a win for Mexicans and Mexican-Americans living in the U. S. Its a great film when you better understand who this movie was made for. This is an amazing movie for the whole family, give it a chance!!","

"trinaboice","1 September 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
An alien scarab beetle chooses Jaime Reyes to be its symbiotic host, bestowing the recent college graduate with a suit of armor that's capable of extraordinary powers, forever changing his destiny as he becomes the superhero known as Blue Beetle.The film was directed by Angel Manuel Soto, and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.THINGS I LIKED:
I first noticed Xolo Mariduena in the Netflix TV show Cobra Kai where he does a fantastic job. He's excellent in this role and has a very bright future. I'm so happy for him and for his success. His character features a scrappy, naïve element to the Superhero genre, much like Spider-Man has done for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Other cast members include Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon, comedian George Lopez, Harvey Guillen, Belissa Escobedo, Adriana Barraza, Damian Alcazar, Becky G, Elpidia Carillo, Bruna Marquezine, and Raoul Max Trujillo. They all do a great job by clearly defining distinct characters. The grandma character is awesome and hilarious.DC Studios CEO James Gunn ultimately decided that the Blue Beetle character would be disconnected from the DC Universe. That being said, we see the name ""Lexcorp"" on a tower from the Superman movies. We also see Jaime wearing a Gotham Law hoodie from the Batman movies.Final Fantasy video game fans will get a kick out of the scene when Jaime creates the Buster Sword as his weapon of choice.We're introduced to Mexican culture. The Latino population will love seeing one of their own featured as a superhero! One of the Hispanic characters dies, something that the DC studio pushed for in order to make it more emotional. Angel Manuel Soto didn't want to do that but later saw it as an opportunity to share how the Mexican culture views death.Family is at the heart of this movie. It's what gives the film both a soul and humor.Humor has been one of the magical elements to the success of Marvel movies and where DC movies have failed, for the most part. This movie taps into the natural humor of a Mexican family and gives it all of the charm DC needed to level up to Marvel.The town of Palmera City is fictitious, much like Gotham City.Fun fact #1: Roberto Gomez, son of the original Chapulin actor Roberto Gomez Bolanos voices a radio transmission in this movie.The film has a lot of entertaining Easter eggs to look for. For example, in Spanish, we hear someone announce on the TV that ""Bruce Wayne Bought Twitter."" Ha ha I remember seeing ""Sabado Gigante"" on TV when I sailed through the channels. In one scene in this movie, we see it playing on the TV in the background.This is the 14th movie in the DC Extended Universe.One element that I really loved was when the Blue Beetle is able to truly understand a bad guy's unique perspective. Hurt people hurt. If only we all took the time to understand, rather than judge and react without the full story.Keep watching during the rolling credits for another scene.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Because of Xolo Mariduena's work in Cobra Kai, we know that he has some serious karate skills, yet they were, sadly, underutilized in this movie. His physicality and skills could have been a real highlight. He's not much of a superhero throughout most of the movie, but just bumbles his way through fights and, most of the time, gets beat up or tries to run away.So much CGI.So much screaming.The villain isn't very compelling.It's extremely cliched with wooden dialogue.Very predictable.Sometimes, the Blue Beetle suit's robot capabilities work but other times it's silent and doesn't seem to help. I didn't understand the inconsistencies.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
A lot of Spanish is spoken with subtitles.There is a surprising amount of profanity in English and Spanish.Superhero fighting
Lots of destruction
Talk of a parent who died in the past
Someone in the family dies a sad, unexpected death.Some blood splatters.We see a flashback of a child kidnapping.Bug farts.","

"clarkkent19381123","19 August 2023","Over the years DC has dropped the ball on so many flimsy and I don't know if that is because WB gets involved or if there are too many hands in the pot but FINALLY they got one right. Blue bettle is superbly done. Amazing visuals and the cast has so much chemistry. Xolo does an outstanding job in the lead role and you would think the kid has been in dozens of movies. The poly is straight forward and easy enough to follow or at least connect the dots. The light hoarded comedy glades back to other films but so many jokes stand on it own so there is no comparison. This is the flim DC got right since Aquaman. This is the film James Gunn should center around. A simply amazing movie even if you are not familiar with Blue Bettle you can still walk in and pick up the story and character but for the hardcore fans there are plenty of throwback references to catch throughout the film. Overall the rating should be a lot higher as this is a great family movie.","

"thisisvp","4 September 2023","This definitely feels like one of those made for TV, Disney Channel Movies from the 90s to 2000s that feels like it came out 20 years too late. The movie should have gone straight to streaming as was originally intended. It's one big, contrived, snooze fest as it rehashes the same old, boring, teenage comic book super hero origin story.Jaime's story arc mainly consists of him being lectured by his family members. Susan Sarandon phones in her performance as the villain, and the story as a whole lacks any depth or character development. CGI/VFX look fine, but the action sequences are very uninspired. George Lopez provides majority of the comic relief, but gets to be much in the end.","

But i have to say at least it was something different.Wow what do they have to offer, the next Superman movie better be all out.Blue Beetle had a great chance to become good but was limited by the writers imagination and creativity.Which is become a DC flaw lately. How about we do a MARVEL AND DC trade off, how about DC give Marvel Black Adam in a trade for Buckie.","

"kelvin-62054","19 August 2023","I'm a DC fan. I love the early movies that came out of this current DC UNIVERSE such as Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, I even enjoyed Justice League. But Blue Beetle is just straight up boring. There is zero character development, no purpose to the characters and the MC's family just won't shut up.The movie puts a lot of emphasis on family and love, which is all dandy, but it really doesn't work when the family is just outright annoying.Plot wise it's just as disappointing. Sure it's a superhero movie, but did the writers really believe that the audience would buy the fact that a loser uncle in the family just so happens to be able to operate a high tech flying aircraft just because? There are too many plot holes that are too illogical to ignore and I do no recommend you find out.Overall an extremely disappointing end to the current DC UNIVERSE. I wish we got a Man of Steel 2 instead of this garbage.I'd recommend everybody to stay away unless you can watch it for free.","

I honestly give up.It is the most pathetic, sad and silly excuse for a superhero movie I've ever seen, it's worse than Shazam 2 and I don't think that was even possible.If you're still going to watch this, expect a 90s cheesy stereotyping low budget Cheech & Chong type of comedy, where no joke ever land, childish attempt to act funny is beyond annoying, sub-par CGI and absolutely worse characters you've ever seen in a movie that is as meant for big screen let alone a DC Superhero Movie.This director should be ashamed of himself and the DC Bosses should get their head out of gutter and stop complaining when loyal fan boycott their movies altogether.. we supported flash against our better judgement but this.. this was an absolutely utter garbage no fan should have to endure.. shame on you guys.","

A family who doesn't do much with their lives who become ""sidekicks"" including a vulgar ghetto sister who swears as much as she must eat.Very unsympathetic hero who is a failure in life, with a family that blames everyone else but themselves, finds a magical alien device that ""chooses"" him thereby transforming him into a superhero that doesn't want to harm people. A diabolical rich corporate elite who wants to create powerful military tech and wants the alien tech to ""power"" it. Hence the mind bending clever evolution of the story...resulting in a box office bomb.Wow who would have thought this would happen to DC again. I guess they will release another reboot of Superman and Batman sometime to try and steal more money from people....oh wait.","

"baileygianninimoviebuff","26 November 2023","Blue Beetle is a superhero movie that only works for audiences who are kids and teenagers. Older audiences who grew up with the older superhero movies that were made in the early 2000s won't like this one. This film contains a cast that has awful acting, and the idea isn't original at all. What they did was take a number of superheroes and they blended them together. Spiderman, Ironman, DeadPool and Batman are the main superheroes that the filmmakers blended together to create Blue Beetle. DC is struggling to create new original supheroes. The superhero genre isn't doing as bad as other genres are doing, like the horror genre, but for creating brand new superheros the idea needs to be original and the superhero shouldn't be so identical to other superheroes that superhero fans can see that they're replicating and copying ideas that have already been done. Even George Lopez's acting wasn't the best at all. George Lopez has done a lot of amazing movies and tv shows. I certainly hope he doesn't return for a sequel if one ever gets made. The whole movie fell apart very quickly and I didn't enjoy Blue Beetle one bit. It was lousy and it's a complete rip off of the superheroes that I had mentioned above. This is just a movie that is better off without a sequel. I am not giving this movie a bad rating based off of any political stuff, I just wanted to get that out of the way. I'm giving Blue Beetle a bad rating because it's unoriginal and it lacks complete creativity. Blue Beetle ranks at the top of my list for the worst Superhero movie ever made, period. Blue Beetle is extremely disappointing in every single way. I watched it because a friend recommended it to me. I don't know what other superhero fans saw, but what I saw was a desperate attempt to rake in money from the superhero fans. It didn't do that well at the box office and it definitely shows. The trailer made the movie look better than what the real movie actually is. To me the trailer looked okay, but the real movie is just pure trash and this is what I call an attention seeking film.Rating: 1/2 star out of 5.","

Ok, some parts were corny.... But it didn't bother me. I love a FUN superhero movie. But this has heart. I cried, a few times. Some of sorrow some of joy. But in the end, I laughs and smiled.I thought it was well made and a fun film. Xolo does a great job in the titular role, I was worried because his character in Cobra Kai is kinda whiney, a little annoying; but not Jaime (his character in Blue Beetle) as he is older and I'd say more mature than his CK character. I definitely suggest seeing this in theatres!!!","

I will mention that I could not continue watching this after 1 hour in, so take that in mind.Acting: amateur.Dialogues: as if the writers used ChatGPT, asking it specifically to generate the most shallow, boring, brain numbing text it can.CGI: I've seen movies released in the early 2000s with better effects.Characters: shallow and childish.All in all, this is just another superhero movie, a really bad one. On the other hand, if you've had trouble sleeping lately and need something to help with that, watch this.","

Whoever thought he should be in a movie again should get their head examined. This movie puts Latino's to shame. Maybe if George would not have been in it I might give it more stars. If you can't tell..I hate George Lopez...oh did I say that already... Can't say it enough. I don't think the DCU will ever catch up to Marvel, especially with crap like this. To quote a popular line from another movie ""At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.

"dorMancyx","21 August 2023","A very traditional origin movie, in other words nothing original -- it's basically a big pot stew of the Shazam family, uncle Ben, Shuri, and Fast&Furious. The entire exposition is filled with scripted dialogues, stiff performances, and cliche development, to the point where the film kinda invites you to nap the first 30 minutes. However, I do appreciate Blue Beetle for respecting the 2 crucial components of any superhero movie: suit up and first flight, as both segments are visibly budgeted. Another thing worthy of compliment are the action sequences, which are well-choreographed, of considerable lengths, although all heavily CGIed. Everything else, including but not limiting to romance, backstories, comedy, antagonists, are just plainly average. Better luck next year DC, hopefully James Gunn will get things back on track soon.","

"jp_91","23 August 2023","""Blue Beetle"" is a typical superhero movie but better than many others, this time with a script based on Jaime Reyes, a Mexican superhero. The performances are good, highlighting Elpidia Carrillo, Adriana Barraza and Susan Sarandon, the latter as a villain. The cinematography is well done, the music composed for the film goes unnoticed and the special effects manage to be good in some scenes while failing to look real in others. The songs used were not really well chosen, there were only two really good Mexican songs, the rest are based on the stereotype of rural Mexico. An entertaining superhero movie without being a masterpiece.","

"chance-94190","25 December 2023","One of the worse hero films I've ever watched as the entire plot revolves around a hero that is incapable of defending himself. He's not even on a heroes journey, just nonsensical plot writing that doesn't have any real progression or character growth. 3rd graders could've written this script.Further, many of the manufactured moments of challenge once again arise from things that have no relevance to the plot; like his father having a stroke that's discarded 30 seconds later for their to have been no actual growth, once again. Then out of nowhere the rest of the family becomes heroes and saves the actual hero of the movie.This should not have been greenlit and you should not waste your time with it. If you go in accepting that it will be quite bad and force you to read captions, then you may enjoy the visual effects but that's about all it has to offer.","

It could have been more but apart from the fact that the story is simply too predictable they decided to try to be funny but often fail, portrayed the family in a very stereotypical and over the top way and often in these situations it is a bit cringeworthy.The movie is likeable as are its heroes and we made it through but it is unlikely I would watch it again.","

"isaacsundaralingam","24 August 2023","There's nothing about Blue Beetle that makes it stand out in any positive way against the numerous other superhero movies around. It's like a movie made to be forgotten. Literally everything about Blue Beetle feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to make a superhero movie based on every other superhero movie ever made.And what on earth is this new trend of creating unbearably annoying over the top characters we're supposed to be rooting for? It's supposed to be endearing to watch a bunch of people act like they're all developmentally disabled because... family? Especially the main character's sister; who ends up being a patience tester in how annoying she was throughout, and the worst part about it is knowing that it's not actually supposed to annoy us, but to make us empathize with what a cool sister she is. Like, no, please, stop. There wasn't a single likeable character in that entire family (except maybe the dad, who at best was just around)... the sister, the mom, the uncle and the grandma... Oh man, the grandma. I would hate life if that was my family.Even with all that, it would be a little unfair to call it a bad movie. It's somewhere between below-average to average depending on how annoyed I am I guess. And no, there's nothing new here for you to have to check out, but if you still feel like you want to, you're not going to be disappointed either.","

"olcare","27 August 2023","This year's new installment of the increasingly numerous average superhero movies was this one. There's nothing original; the character's origin is once again poorly and haphazardly narrated with childish jokes, and in many aspects, it's quite mediocre.I won't go into detail about missing this scene or that scene. Overall, the movie is just flat; a few scenes can bring a smile, and one scene was purely emotional, but other than that, I felt like I was watching a movie I've seen every year.Speaking about the characters in general, if I come to Carapax, his origin is enjoyable, but in trying to adapt the villain to the present day, they've turned the character into an ordinary one that has lost its appeal. Nana Reyes is the worst character in the movie; I've never seen such a forced character that's not funny at all. They've written absurd scenes, claiming she's a grandmother who can do everything; I couldn't make any sense of it. Xolo Mariduena fits the role, in my opinion, but no one around him shines in the film.I found DCU's initial character introduction to be mediocre as well. The quality of this film is truly mediocre; while watching, I felt like they were treating us a bit foolishly. The fact that the government doesn't get involved in any events, and the police or any higher authority doesn't intervene, made me feel incredibly foolish. Yes, maybe Kord could be a big corporation in the film, but it wasn't realistic at all.These companies really need a more realistic scenario and a visionary perspective. At the same time, they need directors who genuinely read the comics, understand the characters, and have knowledge of them...Addition: After seeing its budget, I felt like a fool; approving such a mediocre project for this much money is truly questionable for the future of the studio, in my opinion.","

"ttalje","27 August 2023","To summarize the movie in one sentence: an action movie with a linear cliche story line, mediocre acting, below average CGI and made mostly to appeal to younger teenage audiences.Now, if you go in expecting the above then the movie rating would be 6 and if you are going in expecting a super hero movie in the likes of Marvel then you will rate this 1.What annoyed me the most is the exaggerated fiction and story line. This felt at a lot of times like watching cartoons where just drawing the scene makes it possible to do in real.Another annoying factor is most of the movie is in Spanish so it requires extra effort to follow through with the dialogue.Here is the rating of:Storyline: 2/5. Very cliche, linear and expected outcome. Moreover, the editing should have been done better as you notice there are many gaps between the scenes in the movie.CGI: 2/5. You would expect really good CGI in an action super hero movie but this isn't the case here. That's not coming as a surprise from DC comics and they could learn a thing or two from Marvel. Even when special effects were used on the helmet of ""blue beetle"" when it was half broken in the fighting scene, the helmet looked so cheap just like a toy for kids and reminded me of the old kids shows we used to see in the 90s on tv.Acting: 3/5. The reason why I put 3 is due to the good acting of the supporting cast mainly George Lopez and Adriana Barazza. The main actor Xolo delivers an underwhelming performance and lacks the ability to connect with the audience. My biggest disappointment was the horrible writing made for the lovely and amazing legendary actress Susan Sarandon, she deserves roles that are much better than this and movies on a different league. I hope she doesn't take such similar roles in the future.","

The visual effects look good for the most part, Xolo's performance is a highlight, and the Latino representation is a breath of fresh air.

"deepakdst","27 August 2023","I don't quite follow the thinking of makers nowadays. What do yo really wanna achieve?? Do they only aim to make money?? Maybe then these movies do make sense cause I don't find anything new or rememberable in them.If you really wanna earn respect and attention then you absolutely need a lot more than just an ordinary family friendly good for nothing story. A guy somehow accidentally get superpowers and for next 2 hours same lame family drama, jokes and totally useless character development. And then what? Is there anything that I should remember? Is there anything that I should connect with?I think they really need to try something new and unique cause standalone movie are good for nothing if they are not impactful and remarkable.Otherwise try to focus on interconnected movies, that would be much better unless you just only want to make money and nothing else.","

"jamesdowell000-64-765192","20 November 2023","Wow, and not in a good way!! If you have two hours of your life that you do not have any other means of filling it with, this movie will do just that and that alone.It felt like they just took bits and pieces from Batman, Superman, Ironman, Spiderman, StreetFighter, The Matrix and any other movie/idea and tried combining into one!No story really, horrible CGI, mediocre acting, granny on a Gatlin gun, uncle that apparently is a mad genius and of course the Ole PC comes in every chance it can.Hollywood needs to remember that sometimes less is more. I love to watch movies to escape every day life but dang, that's getting really hard now a days.The one and only good thing that I think come from the movie is the importance of family.So I recommend a good movie from the 1980's- the early 2000's for entertainment!","

"vanvance","22 September 2023","It's 2023, and the superhero movie is no longer new or a rare novelty. In truth, there have been so many over the last decade plus, that the typical formulas have all been seen dozens of times.For fans of the source material, this version of the Blue Beetle is particularly galling. Rather than the 1939 original (yes, that old), or the better known and written second version, Ted Kord (who does at least get some references in the film), we get a third, dull-as-dishwater incarnation, Jaimie Reyes.Jamie is young, well-meaning, and as bland as possible, but he is also American Mexican, and THAT is the theme and focus of the movie. Being Mexican, while being in a kick-ass Mexican family, and referencing Mexican pop culture (songs and TV shows).For those who believe a movie should focus on race above all else, Blue Beetle is a triumph. Alas, dissenting viewers ares likely to be bored, and grow disinterested as this limp film hits you with cliche then CGI, then more cliche, then more CGI etc... for 2+ hours.Blue Beetle isn't true to it's source material, and manages to be predictable above all else. It's truly a wasted opportunity.","

"SebaRodriguezzz","21 August 2023","The movie had potential, but DC squandered it by targeting a child audience, with cliché jokes, dire direction and a message about family love that has already been seen and heard..If you want to see it, I recommend watching it with low expectations, or not too high. At no point does the movie manage to grab you/excite you with its drama or action scenes, and that's a pretty big flaw. I don't usually like superhero movies and this one could have been the exception, but DC failed to deliver.What is worthwhile is the soundtrack, and the idea of the superhero was very good, a pity that it was wasted in this way.","

"martimusross","30 September 2023","Blue BeetleThis was a great action movie, the whole thing rested on Xolo Maridueña, who played Jaime Reyes, he was so endearing, charming and charismatic that you couldn't help but cheer for our accidental hero. He really has got an incredible natural acting talent and would be perfect as a detective hunting down serial killers in Manhattan.The movie rested too heavily on caricatures of Mexicans, the Rey family were economic migrants to Texas, some legal some not, constantly griping about the haves and the have nots, however, it was clear, like so many they were starting again from the very bottom and very fact that Jamie had a degree in law shows the possibilities for social mobility in America.The whole cast was great but all the evil people were all ""white and entitled"", seemingly having to prove there were and good intentions, this was so obviously a political statement that I felt insulted, and maybe a little alienated and offended.I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10 for a great origin story.","

"pantherka","25 November 2023","This was so bad, thank god I had the option to fast forward the movie on HBO, I wouldn't wanna see it in a movie theater, I'd fall asleep. So predictable and cringey, very dull movie, I feel sorry for Susan Sarandon. Trying to copy Marvel by merging Iron Man, Spider-man, War Machine etc. And by copying end credits scenes. I mean cmon, if you're not striving to be original, why do you do it? The story was dull, too inclusive (another outsider getting its powers from an alien source and is now a superhero who at first harms others and himself. The script was lousy, with lousy dad jokes and forced comedy. Leave the superhero filmmaking to the pros at Marvel.","

"moviemanmo","26 August 2023","This is a very generic superhero movie. The plot is so basic, predictable and audiences have seen this story many times before. None of the characters stand out. The acting wasn't very convincing from a majority of the cast. The dialogue is poorly written. The chemistry between the main character and the love interest isn't fully developed and is very rushed. The humor in the movie feels forced many times. Personally I didn't care for the family dynamic in this film although it was a major part of the story.Blue Beetle is well designed and has a cool looking costume. His powers are interesting and the special affects were good. The fights were just okay. So much more could have been done with this film and this character.","

"Meco12","23 September 2023","Okay! So this was not a great movie ! Not a good one at all !! The script was dreadful. Back story wasn't good and quite difficult to keep track off. It all felt very random and rushed . One of them movies you would absolutely not watch twice ! It's very very disappointing ! Really Is a shame because there idea is a great idea and they could have done so much with it. Acting was okay good few actors in there but again could have been better. There really is not much more to say about it if you haven't seen it save yourself 2 hours and watch separate house wife's instead a lot more entertaining.","

"scottypepn","19 September 2023","The movie its self is a good superhero movie. Its got good cgi its got good fight scenes some of the acting from some of the actors could be called in to question. What let's this movie down in my opinion is the VERY stereotypical (poor ) Mexican family thing they had in this movie, it was over the top and very stereotypical and just not needed, yes I know Jaime is Mexican but this movie has done what so many others have done in the past havea poor Latino family struggling to get by with a over the top unemployed uncle and a old grandparent living with them whilst mariachi music is playing in the back ground feels very stereotypical to me . Also why Is Jamie like 24 in this movie in the comic he's only ment to be about 14 he's a teenager that's why he's in TEEN titans.","

"purpleg1","23 September 2023","Looks like the age group of this movie is 5yo-15yo..
Movie should be renamed as Blue Scarab which sounds way better than beetle and have the movie redone to more of a young adult to adult and make it actually be a better movie/story.It's like power rangers meets robocop meets most disney kid shows...
Like most movies now, special affects are good, but is destroyed by crappy story line...
Plus the beginning shows more than one Scarab flying through space and different colours...
What movie does that remind me of?🤔
Oh yes, Avengers...
Infinity stones all different colours flying through space...","

"fontane007","24 August 2023","In a nutshell, this felt like a cheap Spiderman variation film,, the humour was silly the action was same old same old. CGI was pretty good, but there was nothing original about it.Long before the film ended, I was looking at my watch hoping the end would arrive sooner than later and put me out of my misery.The one thing DC often has over marvel, is the darker theme, but this film felt much more like a light hearted marvel film that just failed on all fronts.I love science fiction films and was really hoping this could have been a solid DC title, but there's no way we'll see another Blue Beetle film
Will be forgotten very quickly.","

"newis-82217","29 August 2023","Writing is terrible, one more superhero is destroyed. They screaming half of the movie. All the charactehrs are very unlickable and stupid. The worst are the characters of uncle and the villainess. The only good character is father, but he have only two scenes in the movie and one of the villains at least have a good finale. Special effects are not bad, but after hard hit from the rest parts of the movie, you absolutely don't care. Dind't notice any acting, but even real superhero would not raise such bad script. One third of the dialogues are in spanish, be ready to randomly after the half of the phrase to lower you look to the subtitles. This didn't add anything good to the movie but add ESG score to WB. Syntwave music sounds good but don't fit in this movie at all, it's standart good syntwave, you can even turn over the music from end.to begining and nothing would change.It's not hero origin from 2000 like other reviews says, it's terrible movie from 2023. Even after first Shazam i had the expectations for the second, but only good thing i can do with Blue beetle is to forget this movie.",NA
"munteanugeorgemarius","20 November 2023","Well...........
Ryan Reynolds had a great career after Green Lantern and I wish Xolo the same!I hope this is not what will get from the new DCU in the future and that this is a one time mistake, as this a D movie at best. Words cannot describe how bad this thing is, acting is subpar at best, I just cannot describe it, if DC studios game some high schoolers a scholarship and allow them to do this movie than I can understand the quality of it, I have seen it on HBO max on a rainy day and I don't want to think how people who paid to see it at a cinema really feel!I like Xolo and I really think he has a great future in Hollywood, but brah' please read the scripts before accepting to star in a movie!😂",NA
"jose-viegas","25 September 2023","I was excited to watch the movie after I saw the trailer. It promised to be good. Then...is this trying to be an homage to Mexican Americans? Trying to be do for Latino's what others did for the Asian community? It looks the movie is written by Chatgpt, with too much over the top Mexican clichés. I'm not Mexican but I'm what people like to classify as Latino based on my place of birth, and I felt that this movie tries to put all Latino's clichés on the same box. Everything is predictable, and the story is just childish. I could give it 1 for rating, but I don't want to be too mean. Susan Sarandon is the white token on this movie, which I also feel bad for having such a great actress doing such a bad role. I feel that, if the writers were not so focused on trying to make the film so Mexican American, the movie could have gone on a different and better direction. It doesn't connect the dots. Here is the take away of the movie: Mexican American are hard workers who are treated as secondary citizens, no matter how well educated they are. Family is the most important thing to them, they always have a crazy uncle that does stupid things but they are always there for the family. Oh, granny's are bad ass when it comes to protecting the family. Bottom line, its a movie for American Mexicans. The question is, do they feel it's a good movie for them? The FXs are great though...",NA

Stupid plot. Dumb and awfully written character. This movie has it all. I feel amazed about myself having the patience to sit through the whole thing (I was accompanied by my friend though. We had a good laugh about how awful this movie is while watching it.)I came to the cinema expecting nothing, and I'm still let down.So this is where DC movies (and all superhero movies in general I think) is heading to. All CGI and no good story. A huge disappointment.",NA
"anthony27460","18 September 2023","Acting pathetic, DC could have chosen better actors then the lot they chosen. Story line could have been written better not using a child to play the main role. Language mix pathetic, should have stayed with English even with the bad Mexican actors. George Lopes bad choose yesteryear actor. Are there really no better Mexican-descent actors in Hollywood?It was so bad I battle to watch to finish. It's boring, and the jokes are plain awful. I can't even fathom how Susan Sarandon in there are okay with the simplistic, absurd, and ridiculous portrait of of her acting skills, disappointing. Having Susan Sarandon is not enough to save this disgrace of a film - her character is hollow and exaggerated.It's no surprise why DC's films performances are so low (in both the ticket office and quality) compared to those of Marvel (with this said Marvel isn't doing to good neither for themselves with the recent releases). The love interest is predictable and forced could see it a mile away to happen. It's a way to waste money and time to watch this film at all. I truly advise you to rather watch the trailers instead it's better than the movie itself. It's not fun, likeable, entertaining at all. I had no expectations and either way, I was utterly disappointed.No significant impact at the box office to render a movie sequel or even a TV series.Budget

"gabethedinosaur","23 August 2023","What a wild movie . The story taking place after the justice league, and the suicide squad. Jaime was the perfect young boy to carry the blue beetle and use that power for good and carry his fathers love and strength. Susan Sarandon was absolutely awesome in the movie. After going coco I'm rugrats in Paris 23 years and now she's finally playing a villain for the first time in live action dc movie history. I hope she works for dc and Warner bros again cuase she's got a remarkable way of playing a character so well . George Lopez really nailed it . His comedian and hilarious jokes really made blue beetle a big sensation. Xolo Maridueña As Jaime was the perfect actor for blue beetle . I hope to see Xolo Maridueña work for dc again and join forces with the justice league. Bruna Marquezine Was absolutely remarkable for playing Jenny kord .I like to thank the crew for working so hard on this project even though they're striking for they're rights and support for the movie. I hope in the future dc does more films and series ajd gives the actors and actresses protection.Blue beetle win the box office success.",NA
