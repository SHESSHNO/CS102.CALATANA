"Gran Turismo","Sleepin_Dragon","9 August 2023","Gamer Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo supremo gets the chance to compete for a chance at the big time, a chance at The Nissan GT Academy, and subsequently a shot at winning a contract with Nissan racing.To say this is as far off my type of movie as possible is an understatement, I stood out at the cinema like a sore thumb, I didn't expect to enjoy it, but I have to say it, it's a very good movie.If you're expecting Fast and Furious, don't, sure it's full of speed and it's high octane, but it's more a triumph against the odds sort of story, with Jann the central character, a guy from Wales, taking on the elite at their own game, in what is an elite sport.Jann faces challenge after challenge, and just when you think he's succeeded, he's thrown another curve ball.Some very good use of special effects, the crash scenes in particular look amazingly realistic. There's also some wonderful location work too, they really did make use of several world-wide locations.Archie Madekwe does a great job as Jann, he puts in an excellent performance, you really do see the young man develop and grow through the film. Always good to see Bloom, and he played the part well, David Harbour was excellent I thought, he added a lot to the overall story.Is this the most random soundtrack ever, I never thought Kenny G, Black Sabbath and Enya would feature together in the same cinema, let alone the same movie.I never thought I'd welling up over a bluebird, but there you have it, there were one of two very touching scenes.Hard to imagine it's based on a true story, but credit where it's due, it translated into a fine movie.7/10.","

"Gran Turismo","Top_Dawg_Critic","27 August 2023","I'm not a gamer, I have an old version of GT kicking around I may have played last 5+ years ago, but no matter, what an incredible true story this was! I had no clue this actual story happened, and as far as true-events films go, this is right up there with the best. It's a true underdog inspirational story that was cast perfectly, and filmed just as great, with stunning effects, visuals and camera work. The pacing and story-flow was just right, in that the 134 min runtime flew by quickly. Watching it in a 4DX theatre added to the experience for sure. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me. Now I just may have to go find that old GT game and throw it in and go for a spin.","

"Gran Turismo","andydavis-19959","30 September 2023","I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it, except that it was based on a video racing game. To be honest, I expected something more akin to the cheesy Fast and Furious movies. I had set a very low bar of anticipation.With that in mind, the reality of this movie was an enormously pleasant surprise: a fascinating true life story that magnificently captured the adrenaline buzz and accomplishments of elite motorsport.The racing scenes, and there's a lot of them, were masterfully created. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. It was an emotional rollercoaster; one minute I was grinning with euphoria, then gripping my hands in fear, then I was giggling out loud with a happy release of nervous energy.Being a true life story, it couldn't be spoiled by poor plot writing. I loved the uplifting, feel-good, tale of the talented underdog risking all to achieve his dreams. Yet it wasn't a cliché because it was real; the movie had no sense of being formulaic or contrived.The acting was spot on, the characters perfectly well developed, and the special effects were both awe inspiring and seamless.The movie was enthralling from start to finish. It's absolutely a contender for being my favourite movie of the year. It's also one of my favourite motorsports movies of all time: and that's a compliment I don't give easily. How did this have so little buzz and anticipation before it was released?","

"Gran Turismo","FeastMode","25 July 2023","I watched Gran Turismo early as part of Regal's Mystery Movie Monday. For some perspective, I've never watched professional racing or played Gran Turismo. And I'm generally not a fan of based-on-true-story against-all-odds movies. They're usually all the same.The reason I say all this is to illustrate that the movie had to be really good to win me over. And it definitely does. Even though it goes through many of the same motions as these types of movies, it does it all so well. I was fully invested in the story, the characters and their outcomes. My crowd was really into it as well.I can't speak to how the movie translates the game, but they creatively incorporate some cool visuals. It helps it feel like a video game movie as opposed to a movie about a video game. The race scenes are awesome, you really feel like you're there. I like the cast, with the two leads being the obvious standouts. And there are some really heartfelt moments.I had a great time with Gran Turismo. It's definitely a movie you want to see on a premium screen (IMAX, Dolby Atmos, etc). I think most people will like it, gamer or not, race fan or not, old, young, etc.(1 viewing, early screening Mystery Movie Monday 7/24/2023)As a side note, I'm really hoping we've turned a corner with video game movies, similar to what happened to super hero movies in the early 2000's. I really enjoyed Sonic 1 and 2, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie is in contention for my favorite movie of the year.There is still so much potential. If they continue down the super hero path, then someone like Christopher Nolan will take a property and show what can truly be done. My dream would be for Metroid to be the Dark Knight trilogy of video game movies.","

"Gran Turismo","ethanbresnett","7 August 2023","Gran Turismo is a terrifically executed sports movie, fizzing with energy and momentum from start to finish.It follows the story of Jann Mardenborough, a gamer who always dreamed of becoming a professional racer. Thanks to the Gran Turismo academy he suddenly finds himself with a chance to make his dream a reality. It's a wild story and the fact that it is based on real events is astounding.Even though the real events are unbelievable, the story beats are all pretty familiar and follow the usual sports movie formula. There's the underdog, the jaded mentor, the belligerent rival, the customary montage. None of this is ground breaking but it is all well presented and packaged up. The fact it is based on real events adds that bit of extra excitement and besides, who doesn't love an underdog story?The direction from Blomkamp is crisp and clean yet also energetic and chaotic, which makes for a visually engaging film. You really feel the excitement and thrill and danger of the racing, which was crucial to establish and get across, and was handled well.In terms of performances, Archie Madekwe is a really solid lead, bringing a strong emotional presence and charisma to his character. David Harbour brings his character to life perfectly with a thoroughly engaging performance, and Djimon Hounsou is a scene stealer with some of the more emotional baggage.I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did, but I was impressed! It has an unbelievable story to tell and it does it very effectively. A lot of it feels quite derivative of the underdog sports film genre, but the great direction and solid performances raise this film up above many of its peers, resulting in a thoroughly entertaining movie.","

"Gran Turismo","subxerogravity","10 August 2023","Well, I love the game, so I knew I was going to go watched it, and it's really good if you are a fan of the game. The idea that you can make playing Gran Turismo so real that you would get recruited to drive an actual race car like it was your PlayStation is a Gamer's fantasy and it comes alive in a movie that's not a fantasy but a legit true story.Gran Turismo has got everything you need dramatically for a sports movie. The Trailers leading up to this film don't do it justice. It's got far more heart to it as it unfolds an amazing underdog story.Like the game it's based on it showcase every aspect of racing but now with a more personal touch.It's no Need for Speed but it's one of the best games adapted to a movie ever.","

"Gran Turismo","burntoutboy","7 August 2023","Went into this not knowing the background of this film but came out pleasantly surprised with a great race car driving film but also a great video game film.If it weren't a true story, the concept would have been cool but definitely not believable and therefore no where near as good as it is.The racing and the direction taken to display the races was particularly impressive and at no point was it unclear what was going on. The acting was ok to begin with but got better as the film went on, especially with the emotional scenes. For me Harbour was the best actor in Gran turismo.The script was fine but did it's job well of portraying the stakes in high intensity scenes.Not really too much to fault as a true story racing film.","

"Gran Turismo","taylormellors","7 August 2023","What an absolutely fun romp of a movie that was done a great disservice by its advertising campaigns. Unlike its very bad marketing would have you believe this is a great watch with an engaging story, anger inducing antagonists and some amazing acting performances, David Harbour is especially good as Jan's main guy. Orlando Bloom was also very good and Archie Madekwe should Sue the trailer house for displaying his performance as anything other than stellar. The movie has some problems of course, some of the CGI is abysmal and feels like it was a mix of bad CGI and wanting to make it look like a video game at all times, and the end result is really distracting. Also the movie loves to just abandon characters that could really go somewhere. Overall though, it's a great watch and I would highly recommend you ignore the trailers (that give away a weird amount of the plot) and go watch this film.","

"Gran Turismo","arabnikita","18 August 2023","Gran Turismo (2023)Racing games are probably my least favorite because I get enough road rage in real life. However I do enjoy an occasional well made racing film like Ford vs Ferrari or Rush. Even though Gran Turismo is a highly popular video game, or racing simulator, this film is NOT a video game adaptation because quite frankly there isn't much to adapt. Instead, it's simply an underdog story that involves a video game and the impact that it had on real life events, kind of like what the film Tetris was. However, this one is quite an unreal story and the entire time I couldn't believe that these events actually occurred.The movie is about an expert Gran Turismo player named Jann. He is considered to be the failure of the family as all he does is play video games but one day, he receives an invitation to participate in an online race. The winner of the race will get chance to compete for a spot to become an actual racer for team Nissan. Sitting with a controller is quite different from being behind an actual wheel of a 300 km/h car and soon enough Jann and other competitors will realize what they signed up for.I know some people have been criticizing the start of the film but for me, it was one enjoyable experience that kept getting progressively better. Yes, it doesn't reinvent the sports drama genre but it takes on an intriguing true story and executes it well. The video game inserts looked good and the actual racing scenes very exciting to watch. David Harbour put on an impactful performance of an inspiring aged mentor who gradually passed down his wisdom to the young and inexperienced protagonist.From the negatives, the editing looked slightly weird at times but it didn't take away from the experience as the action and drama scenes hit home. The fast paced story kept me excited the entire time and I remember holding my breath more than once. Whether you enjoy good underdog stories, play racing games or like cars in general, you are going to have a good time in the cinema.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.","

Great acting, great cast with Orlando Bloom and David Harbour. Our daughter liked Josh's Stradowski even though he's the bad guy in the movie.Overall definitely worth watching, good production, good storyline. I like that it was based on a true story.

"Gran Turismo","malz-13196","3 November 2023","Remarkably predictable yet somehow still watchable. Unfortunately, it falls into the realm of complete unreality, characterised by a noticeable effort to impress that results in an odd casting choice. The production feels rushed, lacking the depth needed to engage viewers genuinely.While attempting to establish a connection with the characters, the film falls short in authenticity, at times bordering on the absurd. The narrative introduces a protagonist seemingly catapulted from a lifetime of bedroom isolation to sudden stardom and a near-death experience. Strangely, the parents, initially deeply invested in their child's life and future, inexplicably shift to mere onlookers via television, neglecting any personal visits until unrealistically late. A similar forced storyline unfolds with the girlfriend, contributing to the overall lack of sincerity.In performances by Bloom and Hounsou, one can't help but notice a decline in their usual high standards, and Halliwell might find more success in retirement.The film evokes a sense of those storyline videos often skipped in video games-perhaps a deliberate choice. However, despite its potential, it remains firmly in the category of a children's movie that could have been significantly improved with more thoughtful execution.","

"Gran Turismo","rannynm","2 August 2023","A scintillating, exhilarating watch, Gran Turismo will hold your attention from start to finish with its well-written script, deep characters, and detailed and immersive graphics.The film follows Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), a teen from Cardiff, Wales, who's obsessed with the video game Gran Turismo. Jann's family doesn't really understand his passion and worries about him, especially since he dropped out of university because of his dream to be a racecar driver. When Jann is selected as one of 10 kids worldwide to compete in Nissan's GT Academy for a shot to be a professional racer, he must face tragedies, love, deceit, and so much more on the path to glory.The cast shines in this film. Archie Madekwe as Jann Mardenborough captures the emotions of a teen with big dreams and the fire inside him to pursue them. He comes across as emotionless in the first few scenes but warms up into his character-by the climax, you're sure to be rooting for Mardenborough. My other favorite character is David Harbour as Jack Salter, a tough character to play. He's a typical Hollywood coach, aggressive but a bit jaded because of his previous experience in racing. Over the course of the film, he warms up, which is where Harbour shines; the transformation from a brooding middle-aged has-been to a kind but fiery coach is spellbinding. The screenplay by Jason Hall and Zach Baylin enhances the film massively, as do the cinematography and graphics, as well as the monumental score by Lorne Balfe and Andrew Kawczynski. In every racing scene, you feel like you're in the car with Jann; my jaw was clenched throughout every hairpin turn. When the lights go green at the beginning of every race, the whole theater vibrates with the sound of the engine starting up.Gran Turismo promotes resilience. Every time Jann fails, Jack Salter (David Harbour), his trainer, pushes him to overcome the failure, get up, dust himself off, and move on to the next race. Interestingly, Salter starts off in the film by not believing in Jann or any of the other kids in the GT Academy. Jann's performance turns Salter into his most ardent supporter. Herein lies another message: proving your detractors wrong. Salter's belief in always doing the right thing puts him at odds with Nissan marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), but is another great takeaway. And of course, the core of the film is about achieving your dreams, no matter how unattainable they seem; when fate, fortune, and prowess align, you will find success. Parents should be aware of scenes with slightly foul language, one kissing scene, and one scene where kids drink and hang out in an industrial area and then have to run from the police.I give Gran Turismo 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Gran Turismo releases in theaters on August 11, 2023. By Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!","

"Gran Turismo","iamianiman","10 August 2023","Based on the incredible true story, the film follows the life of Jann Mardenborough who was an avid gamer before his dream turned into a reality by becoming a car racer. What this film offers is something that can inspire everyone; both adults and children and both fans and non-fans of car racing alike. It is moving enough for you to care about the characters, it is inspiring enough for you to realize that it is never too late to achieve your dreams. It is stimulating to the point that you would want to play the titular game right after watching the movie.While the story is far from getting that Oscar nod, this film knows that's not what they're going for. It's not about telling the story in a very detailed way, unfolding each event or emotion scrupulously. It's about serving what the fans want. Fans of Gran Turismo and other-related car racing games like Need For Speed & Forza Horizon. And they did that very well. The film did an excellent job of identifying their audience and giving them exactly what they want; a good mixture of story and racing. What's even better is other audience would also enjoy this one as much as die-hard fans of GT.Almost half of the film's runtime is set in the car racing track. That's a lot. Watching the film, we know that Neill Blomkamp, the director of District 9 and Chappie did his research and study on a lot of stuff. There's a certain mood that he brought here. That nervous feeling you had when you wanted to pass your driving license? You would feel it again here. Those dangerous racing stunts you saw at the Le Mans race? You would see it here. That Playstation-trademarked sound and those Gran Turismo-customized symbols you would hear and see when playing the game? They're present here. Neill made sure you'll have the best experience in the racing track.And yes, you could feel the intensity of the racing scenes. This film gives you that standard upward graph, the further the film goes, the higher the intensity is, and the more heart pumping you will be as the film comes nearer to the end. Even the racing gets tougher and tougher as it progresses with more dangerous race courses filled with twists, turns & dips. Adding onto that, Neill was able to put the audience at the edge of their seats with the powerful camera works. There are some very excellent drone shots here that might just give you the boost for adrenaline rush.But... one problem we had during the racing scenes was that we felt that the pacing could be better. They could have shown longer takes between the cuts. If they did this, the intensity could be even bigger. Why Ford V Ferrari is such a masterpiece was because of its pacing. It knew how to give the anxiety in the racing track. Don't get us wrong, Gran Turismo is still excellent but to up the ante, they could have made the pacing better with lesser cuts. Sometimes, we thought that the film was in a super rush mood, that they cut too frequently that one lap was over before you even know it.Archie Madekwe as Jann Mardenborough is great. For an up-and-coming actor having to take the lead role, he did a good job portraying Jann. Orlando Bloom as the marketing guy, Danny Moore also did good but David Harbour was the scene stealer here. He plays as Jack Salter, an engineer who helped to train Jann and his fellow competitors. David made his character lively and he made the story more vibrant and colourful with his personality. This trio did carry the movie and it actually made it more interesting.However, some pieces of the characters' story were left untold especially for Danny Moore. Yes, this film is more about GT and Jann, but they could have offered us more on his background story or maybe a bit more screen time to get to know his personality and motivation. We felt this film didn't achieve that. Orlando did good but the script for his character was lacking. Same goes for Jann's mom and dad. Their acting are just superb but they weren't given a chance to flesh out their characters and made the audience understand their behaviours or/and actions. Luckily, the story for Jann was well told.We're impressed by the visual effects of this film. WOW! Their CGI is soooo much better than most Hollywood films nowadays. Even recent Marvel movies couldn't top this. It wasn't perfect for one but it's a very eye-pleasing viewing experience when you get to see CGI that is just as good as this. While some CGI looks a bit animated, that actually made it better. Why? Because it's a game adaptation film and the CGI made it as if we're watching a gameplay. It has one of the best CGIs this year. *Chef's kiss*Verdict: An underdog film about an underdog person, Gran Turismo the Movie features slick car racing drama that serves exactly what fans want. It finds the right balance between telling an inspiring true story and adrenaline-filled racing sequences as the film progresses. While the loose storytelling and pacing can be distracting at times, it still manages to keep the audience engaged all the way until the finish line.","

"Gran Turismo","eddie_baggins","15 August 2023","In 2009, up and coming director Neill Blomkamp won fans all over the globe with his release of District 9, a sci-fi debut for the ages that suggested we had just witnessed the arrival of a new generational talent.Fast forward to August 2023 and that very same director is back with his highest profile film in years, a glorified 2 hour plus Playstation commercial with a core cast that includes everyone's favourite Netflix sheriff/father figure and Ginger Spice.BASED ON A TRUE STORY! (In case the marketing teams message didn't quite come across in its incessant reminders to us all that this is not fantasy), Gran Turismo is one of the most inoffensive yet blandest blockbusters of the year as Blomkamp forgoes any of the creativity he showed with District 9 and his lesser sci-fi offerings Elysium and Chappie to put us in the fast lane with Archie Madekwe's Jann Mardenborough, a British gamer who left the comfort of his bedroom driving rig to enter into the very real (and very dangerous) world of organised racing.Following all the tropes in the book and delivering them in a way that makes one suspect the Playstation executives and producers of the film here may as well have sat on Blomkamp's directors chair through the whole process of this film coming to life, you almost wish that Gran Turismo was far worse in a notable way than it is here as the way in which its been bought to life makes it hard to hate with a passion, leaving it as one of those odd films that exists (for whatever reason that may be outside of hoping to sell a few extra PS5 consoles), only to be forgotten about before we've had time to contemplate its being.Reported to have a budget ranging in the $100 million dollar range, Blomkamps crowd-pleaser certainly has a shiny outer rig and it's the exact type of film that is sure to appeal to casual and less demanding of film-goers, racing fans and those that have spent hours on the tracks in the Gran Turismo franchise over the years but for anyone that likes to steer well clear of cliches, one note characters, talented cast members collecting an easy cheque or scripts that feel as though they went through more than a singular draft, Blomkamp's effort here isn't going to provide much value.With a hamstrung cast, that sadly sees the likes of David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou slumming it with roles they could play in their sleep and a hamming it up Orlando Bloom as Nissan marketing guru Danny Moore chewing scenery like its a tasty piece of candy, there was a chance that Gran Turismo's on track action could elevate the overall vibe of the feature or at least ramp up the thrills but compared to recent race-centric offerings like Ford v Ferrai or Rush, Blomkamp's film pales in comparison, unable to ever get its drama or its spectacle out of first gear.Final Say -There have been far worse video game adaptations in the history of cinema, a billion dollar effort earlier in 2023 a prime example, but there's no escaping from the fact that Gran Turismo is an instantly forgettable and entirely unimaginative crowd-pleaser that is destined to be forgotten long before the fumes have dissipated.2 Kenny G songs out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

A young man wins an opportunity to become a real racer because of his prowess in the game. This is the tale of how he managed to attain his dream. David Harbour steals the movie from Orlando Bloom with his gruff, cynical view of the racing program and his grudgin change of heart. The racing sequences are spectacular and the effects superb. Don't go because you think it's all about a video game. Go because it's a story about a kid whose father is disappointed in him and his devotion to a game and his dream to be a real racer.","

"Gran Turismo","daisukereds","28 September 2023","It's hard one to judge!But it is overall very enjoyable, tense and excellently produced and executed.Above anything, the races and camerawork are certainly the thing to watch it for. The human element reminded me of the people-plot on a Transformers movie.. it is intrinsically a part of it (and very necessary), but it is somewhat skippable, generic and dull. Buuut at the same time, both David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou made the movie for me and would not have enjoyed it without them.I also found it hard to keep in mind that this is something that actually happened 2011 (and should have been big enough for me to hear about it.. but it seems those kind of news don't reach my small country). On the one hand, that factual element makes this an impressive story to tell once you are done watching. But by that same effect, the movie FEELs too much on rails from the start and there are little surprises or memorable moments. Doesn't feel like they had to change or enhance much, as it is all very realistic and safe, and most drama is a checkbox that needed to be ticked. As you can see, I'm on the fence as to how much I liked it.I guess I'm glad I waited for streaming, instead of watching on theaters.","

"Gran Turismo","GusherPop","8 August 2023","Gran Turismo, directed by Neill Blomkamp, tells the true story of British gamer Jann Mardenborough, who transitioned from a real-life racing career to a big-screen role. The film stars Archie Madakwe as Mardenborough, who joins Team Nissan after winning a contest. Orlando Bloom portrays Nissan marketing executive Danny Moore, while David Harbour plays Jack Salter, a skepticism-driven trainer. Gran Turismo, released in 1997, is PlayStation's biggest-selling title and created by Kazunori Yamauchi. Its meticulous in-game recreations of famous race tracks and cars have helped gamers like Jann gain familiarity with circuits and vehicles in motorsports. However, Yamauchi's achievements are sidelined when Mardenboroug begins his training at the GT Academy. Blomkamp's movie, directed by Jan Blomkamp, films races as if they were video games, filling the screen with graphics that recall the gaming display. Mardenborough tries to prove himself in a arena where he is considered a joke and a liability. Rivalry within the academy arises as ambitious young hotheads vie for a single spot in the big league. In 2006, Nissan marketing executive Darren Cox created a competition and ""academy"" to turn gamers into race car drivers. The popular PlayStation racing simulator, Gran Turismo, was introduced in 1997. In the third year of the ""GT Academy,"" 19-year-old British kid Jann Mardenborough emerged as a star, becoming a professional driver. This inspirational underdog story, which brands like Nissan and PlayStation can partially credit and help underwrite, has gained popularity in the United States due to the Netflix series ""Drive to Survive."" ""Gran Turismo"" has taken this opportunity and made the cliché version of movies like ""Barbie"" and ""Air,"" showcasing that ""brand"" movies can be fresh, vibrant, funny, and entertaining, even when focused on corporate schlubs. The movie, which has gone through several writers and directors, takes immense liberties with its true story and cherry picks elements from various points in Mardenborough's career to make his debut year as dramatic as possible. The film is credited to screenwriters Jason Hall and Zach Baylin and director Neill Blomkamp, who likes to amp up the excitement of a car going 200 miles an hour with cuts, close-ups, and aerial shots. The film's best invention is chief engineer Jack Salter, who is drafted by Nissan to train young racers and keep them safe. Despite being a cussed has-been, Harbour invests him with an ornery warmth, creating laughs and touching moments with Madekwe. The script reduces most other characters to ciphers, with Audrey (Maeve Courtier-Lilley) being the most egregious example. Mardenborough's parents, Steve (Djimon Hounsou) and Lesley (a sweet Geri Halliwell-Horner), may have had more to them in some drafts but are given short shrift in the edit.","

"Gran Turismo","bentheimpaler","18 September 2023","In brief, this movie is competantly acted and creatively uses CGI to blurr the lines between the simulator and the film with a couple of amusing real-world sequences being shot to look like gameplay footage.But that is where the positives end.Despite some brilliant actors rounding out the cast, the dialogue all reads like a first draft of the script. There is no subtext, no nuance or real emotional depth to almost every line spoken.In most scenes the characters are essentially just announcing how they feel or what they think with little to no actual conflict brewing as they speak.This lack of human interest might be immaterial to the target audience if the racing alone was worth the price of admission, but most of the cinematography is just as overt and amateurish as the people we are meant to root for, with driving scenes being frankensteined together out of close-ups and rapidfire cuts.At no point is there any appreciation of geography on-screen, with the movie having to literally tack labels above the cars to tell you who is driving it, what their position is, and what lap the race is on. Resultantly, the climax of the movie is only slightly more visually stimulating than reading the wikipedia page on how that race went.I was shocked to see that this was allegedly directed by Neil Blomkamp. Though, given the hyperactive editing and some awkward post-production dubbing thrown in, I would be willing to believe that most faults are as a result of the studio either toying with his vision after the fact, or having hired him as the last-minute-stand-in for whoever actually directed most of the film.This movie is aggressively dull and predictable, and not worth the time to either enjoy it or mock it.Just read Jann Mardenborough's actual story online, and then play the game. This was a failure to capture the appeal of either.","

"Gran Turismo","imseeg","22 August 2023","Nothing new. Nothing shocking. Nothing really exhilarating. What a disappointment to see that with all these modern CGI technology available nowadays, Gran Turisma can NOT match many much older racing pictures in visceral exictiment.More bad: many below average acting performances. It doesnt really matter that the story has zero originality, zero suprises, but what does annoy is that this movies' actors are severely lacking in charisma and actor's chemistry.This movie is definitely targetted at a young (gamer) audience, but it doesnt even achieve the thrill of a real computer race game. So why watch it then?Not any good then? If you have enough popcorn and beverages for consumption ready to consume and there is nothing else playing at your local theatre, this might beat staring at your wallpaper at home, but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone, not even the young gamer crowd.","

Toss in a demanding dad, a coach with a past, a training montage and an executive taking a big risk. The entire story is laid out in front of you like a familiar race course.**But go see it on the big screen**The story is quick, goes fast, navigates the cliches and is filmed beautifully. The temptation to overlay ""game play"" looking visuals is not overdone, and the in-car visuals are stunning (it is why you want to see this on the big screen). The actual person was the stunt double for his part.Much like in theater Rocky ~ our audience was into it fully, cheering at the right spots. I cannot speak to how authentic it was to the ""real story"", but the race after race to get an FIA license, the crash, the triumph at Le Mans ~ made for a great story arc.","

But then it all falls apart.Its slow, boring, and extremly unrealistic. A Movie based on game that promisses realistic physics and overall realism. But the Movie is the opposit.So what is unrealistic? These are no crash races, and the driver from Capa rams other cars, like he drives bumper cars. In no racing league he would get away with this.The car driving physics are also not realistic.And what was it about the 24 hours of le mans? Why are they starting in the middle of the lap? Where is the end lap after the 24 hours? What is going on here?And that brings me to the characters. Why nobody has a deep Background Story? Every guy or girl that is in the movie has no story, except the main character. And this makes it boring as hell.Even the main character is not very likeable, typical stereotype you don´t care of.The movie lacks in deep character development, knowledge of cars and racing and how to build tension. Wow almost every race ""Photo Finish!"". This makes no tension, this makes headaches.Sorry to say that, but the makers of this flick has no clue about what they had to do. If they had, they would not do so much dumb mistakes. Ramming other Cars and so.So yeah, another garbage game to video adoption.","

"Gran Turismo","SAMTHEBESTEST","25 August 2023","Gran Turismo (2023) :
Movie Review:A Marathon Race Film For Video Game LoversNeill Blomkamp's biographical sports drama, ""Gran Turismo,"" stars Archie Madekwe, David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, Darren Barnet, Emelia Hartford, Geri Halliwell Horner, and Djimon Hounsou. Based on the life of Jann Mardenborough, the film promises to be a fact-based story but has taken enough fictional liberty for its cinematic appeal. The idea of a racing gamer becoming a professional race car driver is fascinating enough to pique anybody's interest, but making a film is not anybody's business. We have been through ""Ford vs. Ferrari"" and ""Rush""-two of the most popular films of recent or arguably all-time-to understand almost all the classy techniques of the mainstream entertainer. Gran Turismo doesn't try to be like them, which actually works in its favour. But at the same time, it causes a low-grade cinematic experience because the film never looks like a big-screen spectacle. FvF has some extraordinary racing sequences that make you feel all the thrill, but GT is more like a gaming experience without far from the graphic appeal of cinematic spectacle. Also, racing films should be about speed, and this film doesn't have it in the first half. The second half covers the loss, but it's too far behind in laps by then. Despite these major flaws, Gran Tourismo wins the race with its inspiring and motivational storyline.The film kicks off with Danny (Orlando Bloom), a marketing expert and creator of the SIM video game, giving a presentation speech about how he wants to make the video game lovers professional race car drivers. Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) loves SIM video games and is eager to make a career as a race car driver. He is randomly chosen to participate in a race that qualifies him for the professional training of race car drivers. Jack Salter (David Harbour) is Jann's trainer and sees great potential in him. During a big race, Jann has an accident and wants to quit racing. Jack encourages him to make a comeback as he believes Jann can be the best in the world, and there begins the inspirational journey of Jann Mardenborough. The rest of the film is packed with races, including the 24 Hours of ""Le Mans.""Gran Tourismo could have been crisper than what it is since this theme is very exciting. Racing is a breathtaking thing and deserves to be presented in such a manner that viewers can enjoy the superfast ride without any disturbance. GT's screenplay drags too much in the first hour, letting your eyes go sleepy and your body go yawning halfway through. Some action begins in the second half, and you are into the film again. Some of the racing sequences are portrayed with gaming effects, trajectory paths, and all, just to give you a better viewing experience. It looks good sometimes, but not all the time. The storyline of Gran Turismo is like fan service. If you love racing simulation gaming, then you are going to have a good time. That's what the problem is, I guess. More than a racing film, it's fan service. That's why it isn't as great as Ford vs. Ferrari.We have seen Jann Mardenborough many times, and believe me, Archie Madekwe has no similarities at all to portray him on screen. From the first scene, it's a negative bell. He has performed well, though. It's just that his appearance and personality don't match Mardenborough's. Orlando Bloom walks away with ordinary scenes and ordinary acting. The role had something in it, but it didn't spark enough. David Harbour reminded me of Matt Damon from FvF, and believe me, it's no easy task to match Damon. You just can't match Damon at his peak. Harbour doesn't either, but he leaves a strong mark of his own, even though the character remains underwhelming. Jann's parents, Djimon Hounsou and Geri Halliwell, were decent, while his chemistry with Maeve Courtier-Lilley just didn't work. The love story didn't fit anywhere in the narrative, yet it took almost 15 minutes of your watch time. The support of Darren Barnet, Josha Stradowsk, and others could be termed okay, as all they had to do was fill the screen without glitches.Gran Turismo has many racing scenes, but does even one stay in your memory? Hardly so. There was scope. Unfortunately, it's overlooked. Jacques Jouffret's camera gives you some pacy frames, but I don't understand why they had to give those half-cut pauses in the middle of the racy sequence. For flags and numbers, seriously? A few scenes have the racing track transformed into SIM gaming and vice versa; I think you'll enjoy that. Talking about the editing, GT seriously needed to be trimmed by at least half an hour. Neill Blomkamp's direction lacks novelty factors as the storytelling is too basic for 2023's standards. He kept fans in mind and forgot others, but thankfully, it's a critic-proof film since Mardenborough is a popular name and the gaming fraternity is too large. They will have something to cherish here, for sure. I just wish Neill had kept the whole film in top gear instead of just the last half hour, and it would have been a rush-filled race.RATING - 5/10*","

"Gran Turismo","martinrobertson300482","29 August 2023","Gran turismo looked like a movie with a decent story, but turned out its way better than i could have ever expected. Its a feel good, inspiring movie full of car racing action and some genuine heart.Its not only way better than i thought it would be, but also less predictable than it looked. It'll be better going in not knowing anything about the story its based on. As there is extra tension to all the racing in the movie if you don't know where it's going. I was more drawn in by it being based on true events as i don't know anything about the game. But the movies more well made than a ""video game"" movie really deserves either way. As i found myself really rooting for the characters. Plus it has an ace soundtrack and David Harbour was great as the tough but troubled trainer.I almost gave the film full marks but after reading about some of the controversy surrounding it i cant give it a perfect score. As i guess some of the effects are a bit distracting too. All i can say is its really more entertaining than i expected.","

District 9 is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best debuts by a director ever. Elysium was good, and I even liked Chappie. Then he sort of fell off the map and came back with a pretty crappy horror movie that I can't even remember the name of, after making some pretty cool shorts. This movie proves that he's still got it, and can do different genres also. Anyway, this was a really good movie! The rest of this is filler.....................","

A motorsport executive named Danny Moore(Orlando Bloom) gives him this chance & Jann gets the help of former race car driver Jack Salter(David Harbour), to help him achieve his lifelong goal.Gran Turismo is an awe-inspiring film. Director Neill Blomkamp has gone past his sci-fi roots & given us a movie that is an absolute treat for fans of racing films & inspirational biopics. The racing set pieces are mind-blowing & are further enhanced in IMAX. David Harbour is phenomenal as Jack Salter. Orlando Bloom is brilliant as Danny Moore. Archie Madekwe is spectacular as Jann Mardenborough. This is Madekwe's breakout role & he will have a long & varied acting career. Darren Barnet is awesome as Matty Davis. Djimon Hounsou & Gerri Horner are brilliant as Steve Mardenborough & Lesley Mardenborough, respectively. Josha Stradowski is perfect as Nicholas Capa. The supporting cast is impressive.

This is one of those dark horse films, you think it's going to be pretty good, but you are shocked by how good it really is. This is a riveting story full of intense feelings of anticipation and excitement. We are rooting for this kid who plays a video game. It doesn't get more strange. I would say this has a 'Top Gun' meets 'Ender's Game' feeling. They definitely take a few lines from 'Top Gun', and the whole premise is an 'Ender's Game' - teach the gamer how to fight real battles vs real enemies theme.I love this movie for three reasons: it's very entertaining, the characters are very likable, the story is developed and smooth. I was on the edge of my seat for the second half, lots of adrenaline to be burned.","

For the movie not to have any clips filmed in Cardiff seemed odd. For there not to be any Welsh accents (perhaps a hint from the 1! Welsh actress) is incredibly disrespectful.Gran Turismo was such a breakthrough, epic, game and its success was down to the attention to detail.

"Gran Turismo","Rod_ccsqlp","28 September 2023","In the realm of cinema, the racing genre has a history filled with thrilling spectacles, heart-pounding action, and memorable characters. Unfortunately, ""Gran piece of caca"" manages to fall short on all fronts, delivering a mind-numbing mass of clichés and failing to propose anything remotely innovative. It's a regrettable waste of time, on top of terribly acting.The screenplay seems to have been assembled from a checklist of racing movie tropes. You've got the obligatory training montage. It's as if the filmmakers were content to recycle scenes from past racing movies instead of crafting something unique.The action sequences, while plentiful, lack any real sense of tension or excitement.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is its failure to provide any fresh perspective on the racing world. Racing has a rich history and a passionate fan base, yet the film barely scratches the surface of what makes this sport intriguing. There's no exploration of the dedication and sacrifice required to excel in racing, no insight into the technical intricacies of the sport, and no examination of the camaraderie among racers. Instead, it settles for tired clichés and surface-level drama.The performances by the cast are uninspired at best. The lead actor lacks charisma, delivering lines with all the enthusiasm of a damp towel. The mentor character, played by an aging action star of yesteryears, is a caricature of the wise old sage, spouting clichéd life lessons with a straight face. Even the love interest, who should inject some emotional depth into the story, feels like an afterthought, given little to do beyond smiling and offering occasional words of encouragement.The cinematography, while technically competent, fails to capture the exhilaration of racing. The camera work lacks innovation and fails to convey the sense of speed and danger that is essential to the genre. It's as though the filmmakers relied solely on CGI to create excitement, neglecting the visual storytelling that can make racing films so compelling.In conclusion, ""Racing Redux"" is a soulless attempt to cash in on the racing movie craze without bringing anything new to the table. It's a formulaic mishmash of clichés that fails to engage or entertain. For those seeking a truly adrenaline-pumping racing experience, it's best to revisit classics like ""Days of Thunder"" or ""Rush"" and leave ""Racing Redux"" in the dust. This movie is a forgettable pit stop on the road of cinematic history, and one that should be avoided at all costs.","

There was overuse of cliches and exposition (oh let's just make sure the viewers understand what we mean by a 24 hour race - it takes place during the day and night...)
It missed so much of what makes racing really interesting for me as a petrolhead - the build up to a race, the comparison of the cars, the qualifying, the mechanical mishaps etc. Not even the crashes properly explored pain and suffering. It tried to cover too many elements of the story and failed to properly engage me in any of them.","

"Gran Turismo","OnlyGrit","13 November 2023","The movie starts with average teen boy drama and picks up immediately with the disruptive idea pitched to a car maker - solid and intriguing idea indeed.But what follows those first 10mins is one of the worst cliche ridden acting that can be imagined. Everything about this gas guzzler reeks grease and oil.What the movie does as a package is that it does tell the story. Editing is incredibly well done, on point, and helps build the pace of this sports movie that seems more like a family drama.The writing is sloppy and direction is below average. If anyone watching this movie thinks it's great then they have no idea what a great sports movie looks like. You walk out of a movie feeling like you were part of a team - that's what a sports movie does to a movie goer. Not this cringe drama polished, waxed, and detailed to look like a sports movie.","

It reminded me of Top Gun because of the energy was amazing action!!!!I m gonna watch it also in 4dx!!!An electrifying and inspiring ride! The movie based on Jann Mardenborough's true story takes audiences on a thrilling journey from gamer to race driver. With heart-pounding action, genuine emotion, and outstanding performances, it captures the essence of perseverance and the pursuit of dreams. A must-watch for racing enthusiasts and anyone seeking a powerful reminder of the indomitable human spirit. #JannMardenborough #RacingDreams #Inspiring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","

And he did not race for Nissan
They also dont show the real Le Mans track for some reason.His big crash happened after Le Mans.And all races looks like all cars are so close all the time, and winning is by photo finish every timeI was so close to leave the cinema before it was over. Not even the tracks are the ones they say.The movie ""Le Mans 66"" is a great racing movie, this one is made by people who does not love racing. Sorry to say.","

"Gran Turismo","CapStar362","18 December 2023","I have played Gran Turismo myself since its introduction back on Play Station, up till GT6. Despite the few anachronisms, this is a pretty decent film. The biggest glaring issue is that Jann's accident that resulted in the death of a spectator at Nurburing Nordschleife was actually after his 3rd place win at the Le Mans 24 Hour Circuit De La Sarthe, occurred before the race here in the movie. A few other inaccuracies but overall the Movie was pretty decent. Seeing development of Gran Turismo included and portrayal of Polyphony's development team and the aspects that make Gran Turismo one of the top Racing Sim's in the gaming industry added the enjoyment.I knocked a star on the CGI stuff, the inclusion of video game elements into the real life racing blurred reality just a bit too much and the out of continuity of which version of GT Jann actually played and the GT Event itself having much much newer titles than the ones originally played soured my opinion just a tad. With Polyphony and Sony backing this product, I think it would be very easily obtained to have portrayed Jann in his original environment of the much older titles with accurate hardware and the story line to match.Overall though, its entertaining. I'll certainly be going back over this for user submissions later on.","

"Gran Turismo","taz1004","4 November 2023","Director clearly is a gamer as he obviously has no clue about racing. Is it too much to ask for realistic racing movie? If it is based on true story, why not stick to the true story? Prototype cars passing GT cars in Le Mans is because prototype are so much faster and happens all the time. Not because Mardenborough is the best racer.Jann Mardenborough was not a great racer. He only has one victory out of 40 Super GT races. His overall career is mediocre at best. And the movie trying to portray him as a great one backfires. At the end, he finishes 3rd but celebrates like he won. With everyone surrounding him.One thing the movie has plenty of is Hollywood cliché. My fingers and toes cringed with all ""It's not your fault"" moments.","

There is a cast of actors clearly out of their depth, (well they'd be out of their depth on East Enders to be fair), every race movie cliché hammed up to level 11 and almost no grasp of reality.If you know nothing about cars, motorsport or the motorsport industry, are under 12 think the acting in Disney teen movies is of a high standard there is a small chance you might enjoy this movie. If none of those things apply to you then give it a miss. Hell Barbie was closer to reality than this pap. Don't waste your time.","

"Gran Turismo","matris1","7 January 2024","The good: The acting and characters are likeable. The film clips along at a nice pace with a staple (but endearing) underdog story. The racing/action segments are entertaining with some cool game graphic/effects thrown in to mix it up. I also appreciated the homage to the game itself and its creators (being a gamer myself). The (post film) connection to the real Jann and his story is the final cherry on top for how this movie respects the source material. Nice one GT.The bad: Not enough time is spent on backstories and developing character motives. Whilst this would drag out the runtime (meaning something else would need to be sacrificed to keep the pace), a lot of the characters (especially minor ones) end up being 2D caricatures instead of well rounded, interesting sources of conflict or competition for the protagonist. The only thing that really tests the main character is completely unrelated to anyone else in the film. Fortunately, this was my only gripe.Summary: I'm feeling more and more confident that the video game movie curse is finally lifting. Gran Turismo is an entertaining, high-quality racing/underdog movie that earns its audience rating, respects its source material and most certainly deserves an audience. Recommended.","

"Gran Turismo","jboothmillard","17 August 2023","I played at least one of the Gran Turismo video games when we had a PlayStation2 console, the racing simulation series started in 1997 and has spawned many sequels and spin-off games, this film is a combination of an adaptation of the games and a true story that spawned from someone playing it, directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium, Chappie). Basically, in 2011, Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) is an ordinary nineteen-year-old British working-class teenager who is an avid gamer, constantly playing the various Gran Turismo games on his PlayStation console. His father Steve (Djimon Hounsou), a former professional footballer, is concerned about his obsession with the game and suggests he should think about finding a serious career. At Nissan, motorsport marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) has the idea to take a generation of high-scoring young ""sim racers"" and take their talents driving the simulation racecourses and putting them behind the wheel of real race cars. Many motorsport trainers turn down his pitch, until he talks to former race driver Jack Salter (David Harbour), who missed the opportunity to become a champion racer. Salter is initially unconvinced that they can create real racers out of unprofessional gamers, but Moore sells it as a great marketing opportunity. Soon, at various gaming venues around Britain and across the world, advertisements are placed on Gran Turismo gaming machines and the online platform for a competition. 100,000 entrants will play the game, and the highest-scoring players of the tournament will join the GT Academy. Jann hears about this opportunity and makes it just in time to a venue to participate, he is successful and heads to Nissan for training. Jann meets several players from around the world who were successful, with varying abilities and attitudes, including American rival Matty Davis (Darren Barnet). The recruits are warned that they will experience G-forces higher than an astronaut experiences on take-off. The training process slowly whittles the selected candidates down one by one, as their gaming abilities cannot contend with the realities of racing. Jann is highly successful during the process, passing many simulations, driving tests and exercise regimes with high scores and good results, but Moore is concerned by his lack of response and personality when it comes to press interviews. He and the other gamers also get the opportunity to meet Kazunori Yamauchi (Takehiro Hira), the creator of Gran Turismo. It comes to the point when Jann and the others need to pass a test to get their official licences to race, and he must be within the top four to qualify, he succeeds coming in fourth place in this race. When it finally comes to a race to decide who will go ahead to compete in real racing against professionals, Moore is unconvinced by Jann's televisual presence, but Salter reminds him that the numbers are what count, and they agree for him to go ahead. Jann enters his first official race, with Jann on the radio mentoring him. As he continues to race professionally, Jann slowly climbs up the rankings, eventually reaching the top ten. Jann has a routine before every race to relieve his stress and keep himself calm, by listening to ""Songbird"" by Kenny G and ""Orinoco Flow"" by Enya. The press is understandably sniffy about his progress, but his upward progress eventually gains positive feedback and attention, and Jann does gain some more confidence being on television. During his races, Jann imagines himself being in his bedroom racing the courses he recognises in the games, and uses his previous abilities to control his cornering, passes and speed. During one race, there is a serious crash and fire; Jann is taken to hospital, his father and mother Lesley (Geri Halliwell Horner) are terrified by the lack of information about his condition. He survives the crash with only minor injuries, he is shaken but he assures all concerned that this will not put him off driving. The big opportunity comes to prove himself when Jann is chosen to compete for Nissan at the Dubai 24 Hour. This 24-hour race sees him and two of his fellow drivers competing at Le Mans, the most challenging racecourse in the world, taking shifts over the various hours, and if he is successful, he and his team will ultimately prove the doubters that gamers can become champion racers. In the final lap, Jann finished third in his class, which was enough of a launching pad for a full-time profession as a motorsports driver. It ends with Jann, Moore, Salter, and the others celebrating his success with their great placement in the race. In real life, Jann Mardenborough went on to win many championship races. Also starring Josha Stradowski as Nicholas Capa, Daniel Puig as Coby Mardenborough, Jann's brother, Maeve Courtier-Lilley as Audrey, Jann's love interest, Thomas Kretschmann as Patrice Capa, Richard Cambridge as Felix, and Emelia Hartford as Leah Vega. Madekwe gives a good lead performance as the young gamer turned racing car driver, Harbour steals many scenes as the grouchy but helpful trainer, Bloom is interesting as the sleazy wheeler-dealer type, Hounsou is fine in support, while ""Ginger Spice"" Halliwell is odd casting and is completely wooden (as much if not more so than Spice World: The Movie). The real story of an outsider kid from Cardiff joining the elite world of motorsport is interesting, and the racing sequences, cleverly intertwined in moments with the game graphics, are exciting, it is just let down a little by the predictable script with predictable dialogue, as an overall film, it's not a bad biographical sports drama. Okay!","

"Gran Turismo","ThereelscoopwithKK","28 August 2023","First off I will mention the worst thing about the movie which is its marketing as the actual film itself is simply spectacular. The trailer and all the ads I've seen make it look like just another video game movie. My fellow movie going attendee and I based on its marketing had it pegged as what we would call an undercard , essentially a movie where the popcorn is the hero of the night. So much so that if it weren't for National Cinema Day and the cheap admission we might not have even attended.The movie is so much more than advertised. From start to finish it was an absolute rush of adrenaline , but with the inclusion of a beautifully organized and defined inspirational story. The casting is absolute perfection. The David Harbour Schtick works wonderfully in his role as Jack Salter. He brings his grumpy tone but also shows some range in connecting with Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe). Orlando Bloom plays a different role than his usual and executed it well. Archie Madekwe also provides what is needed in the lead role by consistently maintaining a humble demeanor and avoids overacting, which can be a real pitfall of sports movies.The best quality of the film is its pacing. It never gets stuck on any scenes, but nor does it rush through any. The 2 hour 15 min runtime feels neither too long nor too short.The race scenes had the theatre on the edge of their seats with people outwardly expressing joy and fear. With how many races there are included you'd expect to tire out a bit but each is unique and adds to the story. As a sports fan, but not someone who knows anything about car racing or Gran Turismo I feared I wouldn't really know what was going on in the race scenes or they would be simply boring. The way they execute these scenes is simply beautiful and definitely made for everyone.Usually I am a pretty tough critic of sports movies. It takes special work to avoid being sappy and corny, but this delivers a wonderful message of perseverance while never being over dramatic.Quality inspirational sports movies are so few and far between that not many are even made anymore. I strongly recommend this movie. Definitely one of my favourites of the year.","

With an electrifying interface, perhaps even superior to the same video game it is adapting, the film entertains and delivers several emotions that are easy to assimilate as part of the plot. The story is easy to understand and generally quite round, leaving no loose ends at the end of the more than two hours of duration, which fly by.You can find exciting first-person sequences inviting you to experience more intensely, exciting photographic sequences and immersive and effective direction work. The performances are pretty decent, although no one shines too much.It's definitely a movie to enjoy, whether you are part of the Gran Turismo gamer family or a mere movie buff looking for an action thriller with cars and video games.","

Crazy to see her not wearing white. :-))Unfortunately, if you're a fan of racing you can see the glaring holes in the story ... like no practice, no qualifying, how many clutch gear-changes were shown when these haven't been used in race cars for decades!?Other things that annoyed me :In the last Academy race ... of course he was starting in last place and had to overtake every other car to win. Why?!?In his first race for his licence he was running in 4th and then got creamed from behind and didn't finish. Why was he apologising like it was his fault?63/100.","

"Gran Turismo","AfricanBro","15 August 2023","I had somewhat low expectations so the movie managed to surprise me. A lot of the action sequences in the first half were disappointingly brief. The entirety of the first act and parts of the second seemed somewhat disorganized, transitioning quickly from scene to scene, giving the impression that they were rushing through story elements, almost as if they were trying to quickly check off various plot points to hurry towards the uplifting part of the narrative.David Harbour delivered a strong performance, with the interactions between him and Jann standing out more than the racing scenes for me. His performance was important to the movie's success. Although David's acting was good throughout, Jann was his best when they were sharing the screen. Their remarkable chemistry was the heart of the film. The movie does take a while to establish its rhythm and pacing but once it finds its footing, it becomes quite enjoyable, even evoking emotions at times. As the story unfolds, Jann transforms into a driver worth rooting for so by the end, people were standing and cheering at the end of the movie.IMO, the 4DX doesn't contribute much to the movie. While it does make it a little more fun, it doesn't substantially elevate the overall experience. It's weird that the film was exclusively early premiered in this format. Also why is it ""early released"" several times, I didn't even notice its official premiere is later on the 25th.The racing was a mixed bag, at times absorbing you in how intense it was but often it felt like some races ended too abruptly. Ofcourse, it's impossible to show an entire race within a movie's scope, yet for the pivotal races, the execution was still good. Once the movie finds its heart and essence, youre drawn in more, not just the thrill of the action but also the emotional resonance. As for the CGI, I get the intention behind giving it a gaming vibe, but I'm still a little unsure about it.Josha Stradowski's performance was decent enough, seemingly tailor-made for the role of an egotistic douchebag. Apart from David Harbour, much of the cast seemed to be underused, particularly Orlando Bloom and Djimon Hounsou. Djimon, a good actor, could have been better utilized if the father character had been more effectively written, allowing for a deeper dive of the family dynamic. The film touches on a few things but only scratches the surface; like the beef with the rich guys portrayed as the story's antagonists, although I'm not convinced the movie truly needed an outright villain. This could have freed up more time to concentrate on aspects like the father-son relationship, which had a pivotal lovely moment that didn't have the desired impact due to insufficient emotional buildup.The film is an enjoyable heartwarming, based on a true story underdog sports movie. I can't speak for the gamers, but as a motorsports fan, I had doubts and it exceeded my expectations, leaving me with a renewed sense of optimism for the Brad Pitt F1 movie currently in the works. Because F1 really really really loves that guy soo much, like they need to chill tf out lol. Him and Tom Cruise.","

The film's unusual but fitting tone combines exhortations and motivational phrases with sweet romance and humor, all set against the backdrop of high-speed racing action.While the racing sequences impress and Archie Madekwe's portrayal of Jann shines, the film falls into sports movie clichés and lacks depth in character development. It skims the surface of corporate aspects in motorsports, emphasizing visuals over substance. Gran Turismo offers thrills for fans of the game but doesn't break free from formulaic storytelling, settling as a competent but forgettable entry in the motorsports cinema genre.","

Because when it's done right it works. Gran Turismo is very much on brand for that sort of formulaic, feel-good story. It's done right, and it works. There's nothing particularly novel here, although a trio of excellent performances exceed typical genre conventions. What could've just been a 2-hour Playstation/Nissan commercial touches on some pathos without getting bogged down in it. This doesn't have the nuance or high personal stakes of Rocky or the best of its thousands of imitators. But it's still fun and uplifting with some pretty cool racing scenes.","

It's too long, it has no character development, it's illogical all the time. The passing in the races is ludicrous, as if the opponents drive Daihatsu Cuore's while the protagonist miraculously finds the gas pedal and pulls away.

David Harbour and Orlando Bloom are great as always and other actors are as good. I would expect to see fake cars or fake courses in these kind of movies, which fortunately this one did not have those.The movie does a complete shift from video games to actual races and does not go back to games. It would be great if for instance they'd analyze the courses and even cars in the games universe. In addition, it is my understanding, and correct me if I am wrong, that racers would have an hour in every course, the day before the actual race, to get familiar with the course and their car, but in this movie they go the race head first without any prior training and even with a completely new car! Also to me the movie was somehow predictable and I felt that story was kinda cliche, but it is alright.With all said and done, it is a great movie for the gamers, car guys, families and general audience.","

I was more a Burnout player (or need for speed ... but the other one even more).That all being said and me talking to a friend of mine who is into the game (currently playing to grind some money to get a car that pops up every three or four months or so ... and then get the trophy attached to it) ... and he told me that the movie is really close to reality. Some things have been simplified (time line wise) or likely added (you always need a face - an enemy, Cappa in this case) ... and the one person this is about ... well it wasn't the first tournament they started to find a player ... a racer.The actors are really good and if you like racing games, you could do a lot worse for sure. I did sweat watching some of the races .... looks great visually too. And even if you can guess what will happen - because you know movies work that way ... but apparently reality to a degree too ... anyway, this was fun and there is eye candy for those who are into male individuals ... watch it if you can .. one morally ambigious note involving the police (control), but nothing that will be too much for kids I reckon ...","

Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment.This is not even a movie, it is a multi-media fusion cringe compilation.It is ""based ""on ""true ""events"""""""". Where, like, nothing is true. It is pushed to the modern times with grand turismo 7. The real guy have spent years training but here he just magically did everything in a month.It is a damn formulaic stupid biopic. Including the stupid ""2nd act low point"" cliche.And it is premium computer game cringe that you can ever see only in cinema. But the straightforward sincere unfun kind.Die in the game - die IRL.It is just really, really boring. Meanwhile Ford V Ferrari is a truly captivating watch.","

"Gran Turismo","natmavila","30 January 2024","Ah, ""Gran Turismo"" - the film where cars are more expressive than the characters. It's a cinematic equivalent of a joyride: fun in moments, but you wouldn't necessarily want to do it again in a hurry. The movie does a solid job translating the thrill of the game to the big screen, with some adrenaline-pumping racing sequences that had me gripping my popcorn like a steering wheel. It's like the filmmakers put all their skill points into 'visual flair' and 'sound design', but completely forgot to level up 'plot' and 'character development'.The acting is... well, let's just say if there was a race for the Oscars, this film wouldn't exactly be pole position. The cast seems as confused by the script as we are, with performances reminiscent of early 2000s action figures - stiff, but with a surprising range of motion. The lead character's journey from gamer to racer is inspiring on paper, but in execution, it feels like someone trying to beat a racing game on the easiest difficulty: predictable and without much resistance.What saves ""Gran Turismo"" from being a total wreck is its stunning visuals. The racing scenes are genuinely thrilling, and there's a certain charm to how earnestly the film embraces its video game roots. It's the kind of movie you can casually enjoy with friends, especially if you start making your own engine noises. Bottom line, ""Gran Turismo"" doesn't finish first, but it doesn't crash and burn either. It's a comfortable middle-of-the-pack finisher - not a classic, but a decent way to kill a couple of hours. Just maybe don't expect it to rev your cinematic engines to the max.","

Not to say it's a bad film because it's not it just has the most predictable story ever. It's the classic underdog story except for something that happens three quarters into the film which I did know about as was interested to see how the movie would handle that tragic event. The cast is great though. Orlando bloom gives a good performance but the real star is David harbour. Also Archie Madekwe is good as the lead character and his dynamic with the other characters was really good.","

"Gran Turismo","tvnuhhm","10 December 2023","Recommended by a friend, this was much better than expected. It could have been a CGI fest for two hours, instead it told the story incredibly well and blended the Sim world of gamers with reality. The character development is great, as is the Master and Apprentice bond, with the shift from over confident Apprentice and skeptical Master, to a believing Master that is able to encourage a doubting Apprentice. The use of CGI is creative, highlighting when the racer is able to bridge the void between his gaming console and reality. Well worth a watch to understand why auto racing using sims extensively now as part of their operations.","

"Gran Turismo","elijahcabatic","3 January 2024","As a fan of racing I have certain standards for racing in movies. I went into this movie thinking it was going to be okay at best, but this movie was a pleasant surprise The story was quite fun to follow, if a little predictable at times. The characters weren't very deep, but decent enough. There was no character that made me want to rub my head into the couch anytime they spoke. The fact it was a glorified advertisement shown through a few times like all the times they say, ""It's not a game. It's a simulator."" That got on my nerves quite a bit. Besides that the racing was pretty decent. Some of the passes were way too easy, but it was nowhere near as bad as some than movies. It isn't Lightning McQueen cutting through 40 cars in a few laps then being stuck at the front for the rest of the race. I thought cars and races looked pretty cool and the failure montage was fun. In summary, It is a pretty good movie and would suggest watching it.","

There was nothing wrong with any of this movie, and as a car enthusiast I loved the smooth transitions while he was racing, and the on point accuracy of the crashes. It was quite clique though, the kid couldn't stay off technology, his family wasn't being supportive and in the end he got to reconcile with his family, get the girl he likes, and he only just gets his licence. Those are very cliche things. I definitely liked how I would feel anticipated to see what would happen next an worried too when they elongated some scenes of him racing, like as if he was going to crash.","

"Gran Turismo","trinaboice","31 August 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
The story would be great as just a story, but what makes it even more impressive is that it's based on the real story of Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo player who actually became a professional race car driver! Jann gets to play a stunt double in the movie for the actor who plays him. Sweet!I don't play racing video games but I still really enjoyed this movie!The film was directed by Neill Blomkamp. Writing credtis go to Jason Hall, Zach Baylin, and Alex Tse.THINGS I LIKED:
Archie Madekwe delivers big time in this! I'm thinking this is his big break in Hollywood. Congrats!David Harbour does an excellent job, as always. Fans of the popular Netflix TV show Stranger Things will love him in this.It's great to see Orlando Bloom in something again! He hasn't been in a wide release since 2014! His character is inspired by the real Darren Cox who founded GT Academy to help Sony Playstation give racing gamers a real chance in the world of professional racing drivers.Darren Barnet's character is inspired by the real Brian Heitkotter, who won the GT Academy with Jann Mardenborough in 2011.You'll notice a former Spice Girl in the movie: Geri Halliwell. In real life, she's married to a professional racer for Red Bull: Christian Horner.Djimon Hounsou is underutilized but has one of the most powerful moments in the film.There are so many cool moments in the film. For example, the real Kazunori Yamauchi is the sushi chef in Japan who smiles at Jann.Hungaroring in Hungary was used for many of the racing scenes, designed to look like different locations around the world.Michelin Tires was the official tire partner for the movie, providing all of the rubber in the movie.I love the two songs featured in the movie that the main character listens to a lot: Kenny G: Songbird (1987) and Enya: Orinoco Flow - Sail Away (1988). What do YOU listen to in order to relax, focus, or be inspired by?There is a lot of humor, as well as inspirational lines.The action is exciting and will definitely give gamers the thrill they love. In fact, I love that so many video game elements are included in the telling of this story.Video game movie adaptations used to be notoriously terrible, but are we seeing an uptick of good ones? It sure looks that way. Yay! Two of my four sons work in the video game industry and are thrilled by that.At the end of the movie, we get to see video clips and photographs of the real people involved in the true events told in the movie.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's extremely predictable but I didn't care. This was fun, made even better by the fact that the events in the story really happened!Some have complained that the details in the story aren't entirely accurate. I still didn't care. It's so inspiring and energizing.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some profanity
We see several racing car wrecks.Talk of race car drivers who died in crashes.Bullying.","

Every point of this movie was great and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it all the better! The action sequences with the cars and the emotion shown by the actors with the dedicated response from the director made this movie all that more amazing.I watched this movie with my family - my 13 year old son, 10 year old son, and my 7 year old daughter all loved it and wanted to watch it again! My wife was on the edge of her seat all throughout the movie and it brought this story that was absolute amazing! I recommend this movie as a family movie to everyone!","

"Gran Turismo","magicbeamsamara","30 September 2023","👍👍👍Neil Blomkamp is an incredibly skilled and accomplished director! While I may not enjoy all of his work, I can certainly appreciate his talent. I am genuinely delighted for him, especially considering the immense challenge of bringing this film to life. And he absolutely succeeded!This movie is an absolute gem! I had an exceptionally enjoyable experience watching it. David Harbour's portrayal of the mentor character is flawlessly executed. Archie Madekwe seamlessly intertwines with the plot, breathing life into his role as a relatable young man. It's worth mentioning that, despite the fact that this film serves as an advertisement for a gaming giant, it manages to tell a captivating story about a heroic individual pursuing their dreams. The paths to success aren't always straightforward, but fate grants this character an opportunity that he seizes without hesitation. I must express my gratitude to Sony for producing such a remarkable movie. It conjures up sympathy, keeps us on the edge of our seats, and reminds us of the immense power of cinema.The cinematography in this film is nothing short of exceptional, with first-class camerawork and dynamic editing that enhance the overall experience. Additionally, the production itself is masterful, showcasing the director's ability to handle challenging technical tasks with ease.However, there were a few aspects that left me somewhat dissatisfied. One of them being the unresolved storyline surrounding the deceased viewer. While a plot ""twist"" was introduced, there was no proper ""denouement"" that addressed the impact of this tragedy on the main character and how he will navigate his life moving forward. It remains undisclosed.Furthermore, the motive of the ""opponent"" felt superficial and lacked substantial exploration.","

"Gran Turismo","jace_the_film_guy","8 September 2023","I am not a big fan of racing or anything to do with cars, but this movie grabbed my attention and held on. Jann's journey, along with the other sim drivers, is as inspiring as it is entertaining. It was fascinating to see gamers who have raced courses thousands of times have their shot to race the same courses in person. The film showcased some truly brilliant shots of the transition from video game to professional racing.The acting in this film is strong, with standouts from the three lead actors. David Harbour's performance is one of the best of his career, as he embraced the role of grumpy coach without falling into campy over-acting (i.e., ""Black Widow""). His chemistry with the actor who plays Jann, Archie Madekwe, is a highlight of the film. They have a scene together roughly 2/3 into the story that knocked my socks off.As someone who enjoys films based on true stories, I immediately looked up the real events after walking out of the theater. Though most of the movie is factual, there were certain artistic liberties taken which altered the storytelling. This wouldn't have been bothersome, but when the filmmakers advertised ""Based on a True Story"" on every poster, I expected it to be a bit more truthful.Aside from the slightly questionable following of source material, there isn't a lot that I didn't enjoy about ""Gran Turismo"". The acting was strong, the stakes were high, and the core characters had tremendous depth. That being said, I would have liked to see a bit more of Jann's family, as most of those relationships were glossed over.While I have never played the ""Gran Turismo"" video game, I'm eager to try it now. I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of the racing scenes and my nails are down to nothing. The disparity between critic and audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is one of the biggest of 2023 and should not impact your experience. I went into the movie with minimal expectations, and they were surpassed.Best Character: Jack
Best Quote: ""Good news. No one thinks we can do this, so low expectations."" - Jack

"Gran Turismo","adambenjamingibbons","13 August 2023","I would give this 2/10 cos the 4DX made it a better experience but even with the motion master chairs and blasts of vapour and wind, I still nearly fell asleep several times. The dialogue is so poor, it was hard to tell if the acting was any good. Exception being Ginger Spice. I think she acted pretty damn good. Other than her they all did a great job of making a true story very unbelievable. I couldn't relate to anyone, the character dialogue just didn't sound believable.The direction was a bit poor, some very predictable parts and overall just incredibly boring. Had it not been for 4DX, the chance is I would have walked out.That really does sum it up, very unbelievable, poor scripting. I have played 16 bit video games with tiny pixel characters that expressed a hell of a lot more personality, emotion and character. Well done though to Geri for her small part.","

"Gran Turismo","jcallows","21 February 2024","This was a surprisingly good film. It's an adaptation of a video game but it's a movie that could stand on its own without any knowledge of the video game.I, like many others I'm sure, came in with low expectations. I thought I'd give it a shot and if I didn't like it after 10 minutes I was going to find something else. But guess what? Thirty minutes in I found myself engaged and still watching. There was a seriousness and sincerity about it I didn't expect.I was so surprised at how much I liked it that I came here on IMDB to see why. I discovered Neill Blomkamp, the director of District 9, did this. And I learned it was based on a true story. No wonder I had the sense this film was made with care and attention to realism.With your basic underdog story, a likable character and some really intense racing scenes, you have a very entertaining film.The filmmakers did a good job with this one. Give it a chance. They won't make a fool out of you.","

"Gran Turismo","maidwell-45616","19 October 2023","What a strange movie this is.First off, In 2011 I watched and was hooked by the GT academy series Jann Mardenborough won, I've played and enjoyed the Gran Turismo games, I'm a big Motorsport fan and I appreciate Motorsport based movies like Rush, Le Man 66 (ford v Ferrari), The Art of Racing in the Rain and even Days Of thunder.So with all that in mind I seem like the absolute target audience to have a blast watching this movie.What I felt instead was whiplash from the changes in tone, confused by the innacuracies in timeline and dramatic license being used and bewilderment that the entire movie was allegedly directed by Neill Blomkamp.The first two thirds of the movie seem to be directed solely by a committee of shareholders from Sony and Nissan. It's like an extended advert for both companies with no directorial flourishes or tension at all, it's like a bad Disney live action movie featuring cut out characters.Then we get ""the incident"" and suddenly the movie becomes something different and switches gears into an engaging drama. It seems like this is the bit Blomkamp actually directed and makes the movie as a whole quite a bizarre experience.I'm not sure what others are seeing to give this movie such glowing reviews but for me it can't recover from how cliche' and tropey the first 2 acts are, even if the 3rd act does bring it up to an average standard.","

Great racing scenes and good acting (especially by David Harbour)! ""Feel good"" movies will always be underrated for various of reasons.If you're a racing fan or you've had fun playing the Gran Turismo games, then this entertaining underdog story is a must-watch movie.","

"Gran Turismo","mbogich","1 January 2024","Gran Turismo is the greatest formula racing movie ever made. Wait, scratch that. What I meant to write was Gran Turismo is the most formulaic racing movie ever made. It is the product of a paint by numbers approach to making a sports movie; an underdog story, filled with self-doubt, overwhelming odds, montages, and every cliche you've ever seen. But there is a twist to Gran Turismo, something that I wasn't expecting at all, something that actually made the movie even more terrible. But more on that later...The movie is about a young gamer (""sim racer"") who is exceptional at the video game (""race simulator"") Gran Turismo, and wants one day to be a real life race car driver. He soon gets his chance when Nissan sponsors a Gran Turismo tournament, the winners of which will be trained to compete in reality based racing, you know, with actual cars. So, you guessed it, he wins the video game tournament and goes on to win Le Mans, the greatest achievement a professional racer can achieve.That's the plot, minus a few hackneyed details. Gran Turismo is essentially nerd porn. It shows the journey from gaming in mom's basement to real life fortune and glory; from dominating in a virtual reality to dominating in the real world; from watching internet porn to interacting with human females. It feels so fantastical and lazily contrived that I was shocked when the movie took an unexpected turn.If you're not one of the forty two people who follows professional racing, you'll be as shocked as I was to find out that this terrible movie is, in fact, based on a true story. Gran Turismo feels so fake and seems so stupid that I was shocked to find out that it has any basis in reality. This makes the movie worse, because, in real life, the story it tells is actually interesting. So, when the movie turns out this bad, it means filmmakers didn't just execute their own idea poorly, but instead they took an interesting and real story and made it suck.Now, why does the movie suck, you ask? To save myself (and the two or three people who will ever read this) some time, I will give a bulleted list of my grievances with Gran Turismo:-Lots of cliches: ""Can I do it,"" the hero asks himself. ""Can he do it,"" those around the hero ask each other. ""He can do it,"" the mentor tells the nay sayers. ""Your dreams are a fantasy,"" the dad tells his son. ""No they're not,"" the son tells his dad. Almost every second of Gran Turismo is something you have seen before in a better movie.-Absurd levels of product placement: It is easy to figure out who paid for GranTurismo, because there isn't one minute in the entire movie without the Nissan or Sony logo in it. And there also endless discussion about how Gran Turismo ""is more than a game.""-Montages: Once the movie gets going, it is non-stop montages with licensed music. There's at least seventy two mintages in the movie.-Unexciting driving scenes: I understand that watching a whole race would be boring, that's why no one does it. But the race scenes are also, you guessed it, just montages. Gran Turismo does not translate the excitement of driving at hundreds of miles per hour onto the big screen. The racing scenes are cut together with shots that are on average a half a second long. There is no excitement and no tension builds, despite the incredible efforts to manufacture some. There is also a terrible shot in Gran Turismo when the main character is about to execute a crucial maneuver on the track. The shot shows a profile view of the car racing forward, then the car becomes digitized and starts to fade away leaving only the main character. Then the background fades and we see him playing the Gran Turismo game in his room. It's as though the filmmakers are saying, ""no need to feel any excitement; all of this is a digital and fake. Just thought we'd let you know."" Why call so much attention to the fact that 99% of the driving in the movie is filmed in front of a green screen? It's a really dumb use of digital effects-actually, it's pretty much the opposite of what they were made for.-Dishonesty: At the end of Gran Turismo, the main character wins Le Mans. I did some research: he came in third. This leads me to wonder what else did the filmmakers take liberties with? I didn't care enough to look it up.If you want to watch a great racing movie based on a real story, watch Ford v Ferrari. If you just want to watch a racing movie that's better than this, it's a safe bet that any of them will do.","

It's been such a while since I saw Orlando Bloom and Djimon in a movie so seeing them here was very refreshing. But what blew me away was the fact that CHH was featured TWICE. First Andy Mineo with Coming in Hot and then later, Tedashii with Get out my way. It was sooooo cool. The guys are Reach Records are doing something right.If you love car racing, adrenaline pumping, sports, true story then you'll have a blast watchung this.

The Race Scenes were Good and Many of the Moments (Crashes) were Amazing ""Moments in Time"" Moments4. The Plotline was Solid.Problems I had with the Film -1. Many of the Edits (During the Racing) were too Choppy, too Many Quick Cuts. I understand they were going for fast paced but imo They should Let some of the Shots Linger and Flow, so we can take in the Shots and Cinematography during the Races.2. Many of the Races (Although Good to Watch) Lacked Suspense, you just knew he was going to Accomplish what he was going to Accomplish (Apart from 1 particular Race). They needed to cast some doubt during the Races, let the races linger longer, character doubt, tough maneuvers, stop the quick edits etc.Overall, it's a Good Film with some Amazing Moments (Crashes).","

I will say this though, I never looked into how much of the movie was real vs. Hollywood production but again the feel I was left with was real.

The visual effects are fantastic and the editing is just as fast as the racing cars, resulting in a fast-paced movie that never disappoints. I enjoyed the characters and thought the actors did a great job bringing them to life. I especially enjoyed David Harbour as Jack Salter. The characters felt realistic and not clichéd. The film also has a great score and excellent cinematography.If its racing movies you like, you will love 'Gran Turismo'. If you're a fan of the game, you will love 'Gran Turismo'. If you enjoy action movies that doesn't rely on blazing guns and superhero action, chances are you will love 'Gran Turismo'. I found it thrilling and exciting and there truly never was a dull moment. I believe the underlying message here is never to give up on your dreams... This is a wonderful, feel-good movie!","

"Gran Turismo","Air Jordan","9 October 2023","I know we live in a society that craves dumb movies like the Fast and Furious, Marvel and John Wick ones. Still it amazes me how something so bad can get rated so high.The acting is way below average with Orlando Bloom taking the crown. It appears he must have been drunk or recovering from a severe head injury.The script has been put together in 2 minutes.The racing has nothing to do with real racing. The overtakes are silly and never do you have the feeling that you are watching a real race.This has assembled as one big marketing commercial for a racing game. The blatant advertising is so obvious that it irritated me throughout.If the above doesn't bother you then you might enjoy it. I surely didn't.","

"Gran Turismo","suduct","29 September 2023","This is a really bad movie, it felt like a prolonged cutscene from some need for speed game but with a single shinning light, David Harbour (the engineer) who literally everyone else in the movie made look like Daniel Day-Lewis.The group of people involved in the making of this movie know nothing about driving, they recreated physics for the race scenes, they overtake under brakes on a straight-away, and on the outside in corners, they take a bad lines and overtake, their cars brake late into a corner to get the inside line and still have extra speed on the exit? It makes zero sense, apparently if you accelerate harder, brake harder or steer harder you win the race.They take a team of 3 rookie drivers to le mans and put them in the race without them ever driving the car?I did enjoy this movie, for what reason I don't know, but the first hour was horrific, the second hour was much better, but still very cringeyThe real guy the movie is based on has only ever won a single race, and it wasn't Le Mans, The entire film feels like an advertisement for the new Gran Turismo game.","

"Gran Turismo","851222","13 November 2023","Greetings from Lithuania.""Gran Turismo"" (2023) is a pretty good sports movie based on a racing video game and true story that happened to one of its players. I personally love Gran Turismo 7 and while not being the best player (far from it), i do enjoy it very much. And this is plus for me because i saw some stuff that only could gamer have seen it - like small details here and there. But that is not the point - even if you don't play this game i would recommend movie because at its run time 2 h 8 min. I was involved into it. Acting by David Harbour was good enough to carry this movie and Djimon Hounsou stole every scene he was in. And lead Archie Madekwe - lets just say he still has a lot to learn. Directing by Neill Blomkamp wasn't his best by far, but it solid enough for this movie.Overall, ""Gran Turismo"" isn't a great movie, but its solid enough to recommend it. And yes it did felt like a commercial for the game and console, but hey, those are great things they were advertising.","

"Gran Turismo","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","25 July 2023","If this wasn't a true story, I wouldn't have believed its premise. For those who don't know, what happened was the best global GT sim racers were offered to compete against each other and become an actual professional race car driver in the circuit. Thankfully the movie adaptation has vast commentary on the safety concerns behind the competition with no need to get into the legalities and paperwork, and the movie has some of those concerns brought to life on screen. I will admit to not following up with the true story itself (largely because part of me doesn't want to know), but for a movie that wants to emulate the true story, it seems to have taken creative liberties when it wanted to and then missed out on opportunities to take more creative liberties where it could have.Before I get into any of that, let me start off by saying that if in the audience's eyes a film is a win if it gets seemingly better as it progresses, then Gran Turismo did its job. Moments at the end were paid off by what was set up earlier on, scenes had the chance to breathe (including racing moments), and characters all came together when earlier on they spent most of the time apart from each other. I'll also say that I had trepidation entering this film because if they had decided to integrate a lot of the video game into this adaptation (which they did), I don't know how it would translate for audiences who don't know of or care about the game; I'm here to say that I think it does enough to let casual moviegoers to be subservient to its entertainment value while being aware of the virtual entertainment this thing is based around, so long as you are entertained by the story itself.Gran Turismo does this cool thing where, when the character is playing the game early on, they sometimes use visual effects to simulate that of a real life driver (or kind of go into ""replay mode"" of the game when it can), and conversely in some of the real life driving/racing scenes, they use many of the game's audial/visual elements and sometimes make it a game-like experience. Whether it's the classical red-yellow-green start sounds, the racer's position showing above their car in the shot (sometimes in a freeze-frame, which I'll get to why they do that later), the race leaderboard and track layout interface you're familiar with from the game's HUD, the suggested driver lines including brake zones, and sometimes (albeit rarely) they show the follow cam that the game is known for having. Whenever there is a scene in a different part of the world, they show it in the same classic way as the game does with its font and its country's flag.The only real nitpicks I have with that though is that they do frantic jumping around early on in the film like you see in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and literally every place that you go to there is some sort of indicator immediately thereafter that you're there anyway. This isn't verbatim, but for example if the movie transported us to Tokyo and the text reads TOKYO, JAPAN, ten seconds later a character will say: ""Thanks for inviting me to Tokyo."" I get you're following the game, but I say in that case do one or the other. They also had a non-racing moment where they use a video game-like cue (I do not know if this is a part of GT or not), and they had a golden opportunity to use it as a comedic punchline immediately after but never did, which is too bad. In all, I think they melded a lot of the video game in post-production moments and it should entice gamers without distracting too much from others who maybe haven't played the game.There is an act of this movie focused on training the gamers to compete against one another which has shades of what Top Gun: Maverick delivered, but it only lives in its shadow. Yes, they make the audience aware of forces on the body, real life consequences versus simulation resets, and a few debriefs between sessions, but it doesn't evolve very well with a lot of training/racing coverage, and instead stays with quick-cut montages. I suppose if you know where the rest of the story goes and the film's actual runtime (which I didn't, another fault of this portion which TG:M is clear on), then maybe you'll be more accepting of this in the moment, but by me not being aware this is an instance where I would be forgiving if the movie was longer in favor of it. Instead, some of this runtime is spent developing some characters who you'll never see again later. One could argue this would have worked better as a limited series, but as a cinema aficionado I prefer its big-screen gamble. I just think there is more story to embellish on that had to be cut away.And by the way, speaking of the training, I have a hard time believing that a game which makes 60% of its sales in international markets (and 25% in Asia) would only feature victors which are nearly all perfect English speakers or from the UK. Maybe that actually happened or maybe this is where they take their liberties, but I found that to be a bit far-fetched when this is a game source from Japan as I am willing to bet the majority of elite GT racers are Japanese. Maybe I am wrong. They also made a mistake in their competitive race giving all of the drivers the same car color; you can take creative liberties here, but the only way you know who our protagonist driver is is by them freeze-framing and pointing it out to us.Also, Gran Turismo is known as ""the real driving simulator,"" which is their excuse when we don't get things in the game such as damage modeling or overzealous senses of speed through depth of field or car engines as something like Forza Motorsport does. It is for the love of the cars. Yet, this film does not seem to do that as much. I suppose this is where I have a bit of a disconnect being a fan of the game, because the movie never gives those moments that the game (or this real life story) should best be known for. The movie makes a big stink about these gamers who have spent thousands of hours on certain tracks, yet they never key into discussion on their prowess of it, which would be really vindicating cinematic moments. Instead, the majority of their training is running, which I no doubt believe is something they have to do a lot of but we could be better educated on what they are doing to mentally improve as racers as well. These little details help better inform the audience, especially what it means to commit to a line, build draft behind another car (which they never do), and even when the movie points out the resentment that other professional racers had against gamers entering the circuit it doesn't become a bigger plot point or focus afterward. Our protagonist gets one moment to see some social media reels about commemorating him for entering professionally, but never ran into any of the blowback which would show some of the emotional struggle he has to go through. You also see weird inconsistencies like drivers depressing clutch pedals when they are paddle-shifting instead of using a gearbox.As I said before, save the final race the shooting coverage is very quick and minimalized, and largely incoherent. It's a shame too, because this could have been a great 4DX/D-BOX experience overall but I don't know if it will fall to the fray of seats ""moving because things are happening."" For the action they have to tell more than show as a result, but it's hard to figure out this movie's pacing too because you don't know where it's leading to until it gets there. As far as you're concerned, the gamers are going to compete in a race together and it could imply that you'll see its winner race professionally. So that happens and they do, then you get into a professional race, and then afterward you're suddenly now informed that it's just race one of seven? Then even after that seventh race, it's revealed that there is another big-big race that would need loads of prep work beforehand? Maybe I want the story focus to be elsewhere, but these are the things that movies like Ford v Ferrari did so excellently in its storytelling (not to mention the way the races were shot and edited). Thankfully, that last act of the movie really did improve what was shown before, but the first 2/3 of the movie sometimes felt like 90-minute an AI-written trailer.You'd think that a lot of what I said makes me come out of this movie with a negative experience, but that is not the case at all. In the end (no pun intended) it as a net-positive experience, but this is a movie that I see either could have been great or had a lot of missed opportunities despite its true story. Although I admittedly was okay on Chappie and never saw Elysium, based on critic and audience response alone, this will easily be Neill Blomkamp's best effort since District 9, a movie which I very much enjoy. David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou bring fun and powerful performances, respectively, and the racing shots all seem practical (with a lot of drone shots that can look video game-y which is cool), save one shot that required CGI and for good reason. The real person this story is based on even got to be a stunt-double for the actor portraying him, which was a nice touch. I think this movie ends up being a celebratory crowd experience which makes it worth seeing in theaters, and I think many people will have fun with where this movie goes overall. I just see a movie that will sometimes pale to other movies that compare to it especially when it is so close to them in narrative and release timing, but on its own merits it's absolutely a fun experience both for GT fans and casual moviegoers. If nothing else, it's absolutely a ringing endorsement for Gran Turismo as a video game and Sony as a corporation. I wish nothing but success for this film and maybe later I'll get to look up the passage of time for the actual true story.","

"Gran Turismo","tm-sheehan","17 August 2023","My Review-Gran Turismo (2023)
My Rating 8/10I was surprised how much I enjoyed this very entertaining and interesting movie as I'm certainly not a racing car fan or video game nerd .Based on true events it's quite an inspirational story of Jann Mardenborough played very impressively by Archie Madekwe.The movie title Gran Turismo or GT) is derived from a series of racing simulation video games developed by Polyphony Digital and produced by Kazunori Yamauchi with an estimated production budget of 100 million US$.The film's story begins in 2008 with teenager Jann Mardenborough an obsessed and skilful Gran Turismo player whose gaming skills eventually win a series of Nissan competitions to become an actual professional racecar driver.Orlando Bloom is very well cast as Danny Moore a former Nissan Europe Corporate executive who pitches his revolutionary concept to Japanese Nissan executives of forming a GT International Academy to select by suitable candidates with exceptional gaming skills to train as professional racing car drivers telling them the sales of the video games will produce amazing profits for the company with increased sales.The idea is accepted with the provision that Danny Moore hires an expert engineer to ensure there are no accidents or injuries that will reflect badly on the Nissan Corporation.Jack Salter outstandingly played by David Harbour is hesitant at first because training amateur car racers to risk life and limb in the International racing circuit sounds like insanity but when he is insulted and devalued by his current employer he hops on board to train a dozen young candidates of which Jann Mardenborough a young man from Cardiff eventually turns out his star pupil.One of the aspects of this movie that impressed me was the performance of Archie Madekwewho who I had only seen in one forgettable 2019 movie Midsommer his portrayal of Jann Mardenbrough was nuanced ,well mannered and touching without the super ego that's often on display with sporting heroes as the story of his triumphs and disastrous setbacks unfolds I was inspired by his strength of character even though I cannot understand why anyone would risk their life constantly behind the wheel of a supersonic vehicle.The last racing car film I saw was Ford vs Ferrari which I also surprisingly enjoyed I gave that a 9/10.Director Neill Blomkamp and screenplay writers Jason Hall and Zach Baylin have given us a thrilling and very interesting story based on true events the amazing camera work and special effects from Jacques Jouffret and production designer Martin Whist are some of the best I've seen this year.I was interested to read that the racing stunt double used in the movie for Archie Madekwe was in fact the real Jann Mardenborough .I liked this movie very much and thoroughly recommend Gran Turismo .","

"Gran Turismo","alindsayal","14 August 2023","I have an interest in all sport and that includes motor sport as that is a big thing going on in my household. So when Gran Turismo was announced to be made into a film, I knew I was going to be watching it. Yesterday, I watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man who is one of the greatest Gran Turismo players in the world given the chance to become a professional race car driver.Main Character
Archie Madekwe plays the real life person of Jann Mardenborough and he is okay in this film. He is a pretty easy person to relate to and want to see succeed. The whole premise of this persons life is insane and I think Archie managed to convey that and he had some really good scenes with some of the stronger actors. But I also think there were a few missed opportunities, where he is meant to take charge and it doesn't quite work, he mumbles and you can tell he hasn't quite nailed it yet as a leading man. I think this is a good step for him and hopefully we can see more of him in the future.Supporting Characters
There is an experienced but small supporting cast. Dave Harbour plays Jack Salter, the chief engineer of the team and he is truly fantastic in this role, you can tell he is super passionate about this film and this role and he delivers a memorable performance and one that shows his strength as an actor.Orlando Bloom hasn't done much the last few years but he is good here playing Danny Moore who is the marketing and head of the programme. He is charismatic and also looks like he is having a great time, he doesn't have as much depth as some of the other characters but he is just a fun addition of the film.Djimon Hounsou plays Jann's father and he is great in his smaller role. There is a clear conflict between the two of them in terms of Jann's aspirations and dreams. But Hounsou delivers some strong scenes and even though he isn't in the film a lot he is pretty memorable.Story
The story is pretty crazy and the fact that the majority is true is even crazier. Don't let the title of the film trick you, this is not a video game movie. It has a strong story that sees this young man look to get his dream, it is a pretty simple underdog story but it is done well enough for sure. They squeeze his rise into this one film and I am sure there is more to the plot but I appreciated how the story was told. But I felt like everything not involving the racing was a bit dull, for example there is a romance which is really underdeveloped and the two characters barely share scenes together so it made me wonder why I should care.Script
The script is a bit of a mixed bag. This film takes itself very seriously and for the most part it is done effectively, you care about the people and the situations they are in. The humour is chuckle worthy and it doesn't overstep and the balance is well down. There are just parts of the film that aren't written as well and that I didn't care about as much.Style
The film looks great, all the driving scenes are well filmed and make it feel like you are in the car with the characters. It incorporated the video game aspects well that it didn't overbear the film and allowed the focus to be on the actual driving. The film was paced pretty well too, keeping me interested for the majority of the film.Overall
Overall, Gran Turismo is a good film. It doesn't matter if you have ever played the video game or even are a fan of the sport, I think this could be a film you enjoy and should give a chance.Rating - 7/10.","

Even GT (is a half-sim) has some reality way more than this. For starters Whats with the Hungaroring? Silverstone Academy is reverse Hungaroring, Le Mans (La Sarthe) is regular Hungaroring.... In racing there is no wiggly helmets; cars don't explodes, engines do, there are no spotters except ovals!; track races have qualies, you don't start in the middle of nowhere; you dont pass your opponent with down shifts and sudden throttle; GT3 cars are fast as any car on straights; Le Mans 24H doesn't finish at the last lap; it finishes at the end of 24 hours + 1 lap; Nurburgring is 20.83 km and if you crash in the middle of it nobody waves yellow flags in start-finish straight. I could have add more but i am already bored. Good soundtrack, good cinematography, well blended CGI but no soul and no technical aspect. I dont even know how Yamauchi San gave his blessing to this as himself a real deal racing driver. Lastly this film is the second DRIVEN disaster IMO.","

I think its a way to save the company by producing such a kiddish movie.. by putting true story on the description will give the movie the weight that they request. When it comes to movie scenario, no competitors going to the race just to stop other opponent.. all of these racers are representing a worthy brand and they are not looking to do dirty actions on purpose.. also by grabbing a kid from a console to drive 700hp car is not doable.. my own perspective on this movie that its just marketing and propaganda to move the still water at Nissan.. nothing else.","

"Gran Turismo","hansped","28 September 2023","Okay, so this movie, or rather the decisions that the production have made, confuses me.To get the basic points over with: I like the casting. I think the acting is good overall. The script is OK but not much more, but I would say it makes for a decent watch. The movie could based on these point be an OK entertaining movie.What makes it a total trainwreak for me is all the blantant wrongs in how racing and motorsports work. It makes no sense! Why make a movie about motorsport, based on a supposedly realistic game, and then not make the racing realistic?To give an example. During a series of races, mid movie, they portray some kind of major league racing series. The protaginists bigges hurdle during these races isn't his lack of experience. His main hurdle is another driver continuously ramming him on purpose, race after race. During the series first race he rams the protagonist who spins out at almost ends up in a wall! HE WOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE RACING! A driver lika that would be disqualified and probably get his licenses revoked. And someone in the production must have known that's how it works! Couldn't they figure out any other way to build suspense?Then there is a lot of smaller details that's just lazy beyond sense. For example. When a car gets in to what would most likely have been a fatal crash and covers an entire section of the track with debrie and fluids they yellow-flag it instead of red-flagging it. They restart the race before the driver of the crashed car event gets of the track.It's just lazy and I can't see anyone knowing anything about motorsport enjoying this movie. And it could have been desent.","

"Gran Turismo","SnoopyStyle","29 September 2023","Marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) pitches a crazy idea to Nissan motorsport and developer of the video game Gran Turismo. It's a contest to find a top game player who can be transformed into a real world driver. Former driver and engineer Jack Salter (David Harbour) is tired of the diva drivers and agrees to manage his program. Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) had always wanted to be a racing driver, but his father Steve Mardenborough (Djimon Hounsou) insists on limiting his dream.Director Neill Blomkamp brings this real life story to the big screen. I'm only a casual racing fan. I think I remember Jann driving. It's a compelling story and well suited to the underdog sports movie genre. I like the young actor playing the lead although David Harbour is the more compelling one. It's a very standard true story movie. The drama is never that surprising. The racing sequences are fine. It's all fine like a simulation of the real thing.","

But, obviously being a Gamer Man, I have played similar Games with racing like Burn Out 2 & the Grand Theft Auto series! So, of course, I do have good knowledge of Racer Games & myself felt like I was playing as I watched the film! That, & of course I've seen Grand Prix racing on TV & similar Films like this one, so I basically knew what to expect despite not knowing the true story!The film is based on the unbelievable, inspiring true story of Jann Mardenborough, die hard Gran Turismo player who's given the opportunity of a lifetime to compete in the European Race Circuit after winning a Gran Turismo Gaming Simulation! Together with an retired Racer Jack Salter & Nissan Exce Danny Moore, the 3 pull off the impossible!I found the film to be really good! It was brilliant! It's 2 hours & 6 minutes of racing, Adrenalin & feel good moments leaving wanting more & exhilarated til the finish line! The films story is good & inspiring, even though it was based off of a true story anyway, it was still a great story & one that needed to be brought to the big screen!The characters are great in this! Some were actual racers in real life which added to the authenticity to the film, hey, even Jann Mardenborough himself was a stand in for the stunts preformed in this film which was ace! There's plenty of action & some touching scenes as well as some eye candy too... Emelia Hartford though! Hottie!Overall, it's an ace film! It was brilliant! Love every minute of it!

Overall, I was somewhat disappointed. Given the quality of films have been reaching theaters lately. This film is geared towards very young men. And it attempts to glorify something that most of us have come to know, and even our surgeon general has flagged our society about: isolating oneself and becoming obsessed with virtual reality. It is all packaged within some clever special effects, however, the underlying message to viewers is someone counterintuitive, since it's the very topic that is falling under scrutiny by healthcare professionals. It wouldn't be so bad if the quality of the film or higher, but there's just no substance or depth in this presentation.","

"Gran Turismo","tomearwig","29 October 2023","The story is obviously pretty poor, trying to convert from a computer game to real life situation.The dialogue for some of the characters is pretty shocking and blooms character from the start doesn't really fit in. Not sure if it's his acting or just poorly written! I didn't feel like you could connect with any of the characters as they are pretty soulless and have extremely little back story so you can't really connect or care about them. It's a shame they didn't make it more about the game instead of trying to make a convincing racing movie.I guess the idea is to watch this as more of a computer game movie than an actual film about racing. There are better films out there like rush and Le Mans 66.It was entertaining but not something I would go out my way to watch again.","

"Gran Turismo","mscox-45970","20 January 2024","What I thought was another car movie turned out to be inspirational, heartfelt, and a show of determination. What a tremendous story of self belief. Sometimes you just need an opportunity. This is a story of a dreamer, along with a man and his vision. The two of them together would never dream of what they would accomplish in a field of professionals. You will see heartache, love, passion, determination, grit, and complete vision of one's belief in themselves. This film will inspire. It will motivate. It will encourage. It will leave you with all the emotions. This was a 9 for me based on how it left me after. Tremendous film. Watch it.","

"Gran Turismo","Rade007","29 September 2023","People, this is almost a perfect film. And I could end the review right here because this is a movie that everyone will enjoy. Anyone who doesn't probably doesn't know anything about movies and only claims to watch heavy dramas. Well, this is indeed a heavy drama. This is everything a top-tier movie should be.I'll assume you remember the not-so-distant ""racing"" spectacle ""Ford vs Ferrari,"" or as some call it, ""Le Mans '66."" That film was nominated for an Oscar in 2019, and just like this one, it's based on true events and falls into the biographical film category. ""Gran Turismo"" is on par with that film in terms of quality, and if there's any justice, it will get a ticket to the Dolby Theatre next year.","

The racing sequences could have been more attractive and breath taking.But these flaws won't prevent me from giving a high score to Gran Turismo because I enjoyed it, and I see it as a significant improvement when it comes to video game movie adaptations. That is why regarding the score, I give Gran Turismo 8 out of 10.","

"Gran Turismo","noshouse","8 September 2023","Although the trailer's music and pacing feel different from the typical racing films, it's totally fine. Playing video games is a common leisure activity for many people. From childhood, we started with games where the computer used a keyboard. When it came to racing games, we used a joystick. As we grew older, games had joysticks, and racing games had dedicated steering wheel joysticks. As we got even older, racing games came with specialized seats and pedals. Yes, racing-themed content is all about that sense of speed, and this movie will definitely satisfy that. Unlike 'Alivehoon,' this film is based on the true story of Yang-Martinborough, and his proactive and enthusiastic pursuit of becoming a race car driver has been quite inspiring from the beginning.","

I mean, they went all out, gathered the crème de la crème of terrible Hollywood screenwriters, and somehow managed to cram every lousy action cliché into this one flick, effectively obliterating what could have been an epic story.And let's not forget the direction - it's so horrendous that even Disney's worst films would be ashamed.Now, the characters are pure caricatures. You've got your classic setup of the kind-hearted underdog battling the evil rich dude, the sweet girlfriend, and a posse of nerdy sidekicks. It's all so predictable and shallow, and the acting..........I generously give it a 4 out of sheer love for the game. Honestly, if it weren't for that, I'd happily slap a lone star on it without batting an eyelash.Utterly dreadful, old chap!","

That being said, the rest of it was very good. The direction here was quite good... almost using things from the game to clearly let you know where the main character was in the racing field. The racing scenes are quite good and exciting. David Harbour is excellent as the mentor and Archie Madekwe was excellent as Jann Mardenborough. Apparently there was controversy about the accident that they have in the movie, that really happened. To me that seems crazy. I give the movie great credit for using it.","

"Gran Turismo","masonsaul","12 August 2023","Gran Turismo is one of the most excessively corporate films in quite a while and it's overly long but despite all that it remains an endearing underdog story that uses the familiarity of its racing rendition of the Rocky story to really good effect.Archie Madekwe makes sure Jann is confident without ever becoming annoying and remains a likeable lead throughout. David Harbour is the best thing in it, the resentment he has of Jann that slowly grows into respect is the heart of the film and he delivers a great motivational speech.Orlando Bloom's businessman is slimy without being completely irredeemable and Djimon Hounsou gets to show a level of emotion rarely seen at this scale that offers a welcome reminder he's damn good when given the opportunity.Neill Blomkamp was an unusual pick to direct this but it turns out he was actually a solid choice. He gets the camera as close to the racing and inner workings of the cars as possible. He melds the game and real world together effectively and the drone shots aren't awful for once.","

For sure the compositions of Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Bill Ward and Geezer Butler bring an adrenaline over the scene that has your band playing!It's a great movie, with great racing scenes.

The most interesting part is every player feels that he is much younger than his real age. Also releases all the stresses.Anyway, first of alI I loved the sound design and editing very much. The way Daandvid, Archie and Orlando were acted is really outstanding. A big thanks to the stunts who really drived the vehicles in the movie.

"Gran Turismo","demonblade-37792","10 August 2023","Gran Turismo (2023) is a about a young adult named Jann Mardenboro (Archie Madewe) playing the video game and hopes he can achieve his dreams to become a professional race car driver. He has an opportunity to show it by being accepted by the Nissan GT invitational to see who will become one. He keeps training until his hard work pays off by fully accomplishing his dream.Overall, I thought it was a good movie based on a true story! Madewe plays Mardenboro in a good underdog role who never backs down and earns respect by doing the work. Hearing that it came from a young adult's true story made me like the movie even more.The acting was great by everyone especially as David Harbour playing the hard-hitting coach Jack Salter in a well-received role. The action from cars racing and crashes was fun to watch. The movie as a whole reminded me of Ford Vs. Ferrari (2019) because of the story, races, and the locations on where they drove. Director Neil Blomkamp does a good job of portraying life isn't more than a just video game, but as a career as well. Overall, Gran Turismo is good with its story, acting, and action. I would recommend watching it in theaters for a good action-adventure watch!","

"Gran Turismo","talking_about_movies","20 August 2023","This is a very simple underdog story about a gamer who was selected as a racer in a special marketing strategy by Nissan.I had fun with this movie. It has an energetic vibe and a fast enough pace, which keeps you entertained for almost all of its runtime. I thought the acting in this movie was very good. Especially by Archie Madekwe as the main character, Jann Mardenborough, and David Harbour as the coach, Jack Salter, who was my favourite character in the movie. These 2 characters are the heart of the movie, and they are what gave this movie the strong emotional push that it needed in the 2nd act. The direction by Neill Blomkamp is also pretty good. It's nice to see a different movie from him. I thought the racing scenes could have been a bit more grounded rather than stylish. But I had fun with the little things he did during the racing scenes that compared the real races to video games. Some of the racing scenes in the 2nd act are actually very thrilling and the sound design had a huge role in that. I also really cared for Jann's character. Who doesn't love an underdog? There's also one particular direction the story took in the 2nd act, that was almost shocking and added a lot more emotional weight to the story.But compared to some of the classic racing movies like Ford v Ferrari, this one is very easy-going. It has a lot less thrills than I would have liked it to have. There are thrills though for sure. But the final race of this movie was just underwhelming. There weren't really any setbacks in that race, and if there were, they were overcome pretty easily. Which is why the conclusion didn't quite feel earned. The characters and the relationships between them too aren't well explored. Given the 2+ hour runtime, they could've been.This is a fun movie for sure, and one you'll enjoy watching with a group of people. It doesn't have a dull moment, it's stylish, action-packed and it's a nice underdog story. The payoff though, is pretty underwhelming and could've been made a lot more impactful than it was.","

"Gran Turismo","scavneck-479-227677","16 September 2023","A movie about a racing sim and real racing where you overtake by randomly finding that magical extra gear and pressing the gas pedal to the metal during a straight, but not only that, you overtake by down shifting mid corner and pressing the gas pedal to the metal. One thing doesn't exist and the other would make you spin out of control and crash your car.The script is total cliché, with the regular sensationalist distortion of the real story, while the racing itself fails miserably.The acting is ok but not great at any point, as the people involved obviously know nothing about racing, so the passion is not there.Listen to any podcast or watch any documentary about the real driver on YouTube and you'll have a lot of fun, because as always, the real story is always better and more magical than what Hollywood comes up with.This movie is an insult to racing fans. Honestly it's an insult to anyone with a driving licence.I literally paid to loose 2h of my life.I don't know why people who hate the thing always have to be the ones making the movie about the thing.","

I have none of those to say about Gran Turismo.The beginning of the movie is very 'Ready Player One'ish' as it introduces you to a character you'll inevitably be following the whole movie.From there, the movie really becomes good. The story is obviously great, but what carries the movie is how the two main characters show & act their emotions. I don't think you could've chosen 2 better leads.The lead actors are spectacular, and the main character's father (who's a famous actor as well) is as always, superb.I'm not sure why these critics are saying this movie has no soul. This movie has a TON of soul, and you'll find yourself crying at the very least, once.The only reason I gave it an 8 is because it was nothing ground breaking. It's just a really good movie.","

"Gran Turismo","joseasuarez","25 August 2023","The first thing that jumps out of control is the ""he's and underdog"" resource. Although he is an underdog the plot could be better crafted.Second of all, if you see the movie without any knowledge of Motorsport, it's an acceptable film, a little generic and goes for ""play it safe"", but not that bad.Anyhow, as someone that has been involved in motor sports, it lacks of realism. Clearly not a biographical motion picture. More of a propagandistic piece for nissan than an actual artwork. There are so many errors portrayed while representing motor sport that the whole movie just becomes offensive for real drivers, fans and ""motorheads"".In conclusion, if anybody is about to make a movie about racing cars, the minimum effort expected is to learn anything about cars before even attempting to do the actual footage.P.s. One of the most remarkable errors in the movie is the start of the 24h of Le Mans. Traditionally drivers run to their cars at the beginning of the race and in the movie they just begin with the engine started an in the grid as in a GT or F1 format.","

The kid acted like he knew everything about racing without any/much real life training. It also gives excuses to kids that if you play games you could be a professional someday, I bet his dad is glad he didn't play war games. Which brings me to that subject why stop there why not hire kids to kill people (not including the unlucky car fan that was for some reason standing alone when a upside down racing car came at em) but like in an Assassins game or better yet get kids to fly commercial airlines? It was lucky that all the qualifying kids in the movie was slim enough to fit in the cars too and looked like racing drivers.The only thing that made the movie worth watching was David Harbour (Jack Salter) acting he was the only thing good in the movie. I know this was based of a true story but the way film makers putting this together just to keep your attention is ridiculous. However I did like the fact that the kid didn't become first/second place, it made it slightly more realistic.BTW if you want to know my credentials I have made thousands of reviews and I am an expert on putting words next to other words.

This movie stands on its own as one that explores family relationships, being your own person, overcoming fear, and meeting challenges head on. The casting was excellent as was the acting. My only disappointments are that (in my opinion) there was not a memorable music score or impressive cinematography which, along with the notion that I haven't decided if Gran Turismo would warrant my watching it a second time now that I know the ending is why I gave this film 8 rather than 10 stars.","

Even with its bloated runtime, rough CGI, and overstuffed plot, Gran Turismo is mostly well-acted, features many heartfelt and compelling scenes, and boasts terrific sound mixing and editing that heighten the speed and danger of the racing sequences.Sport biopic formula is predictably followed, but the central characters are given plenty of depth and unique traits to make their interactions largely believable and sometimes moving.Although the lack of color grading sometimes makes the film look ugly, some clever gleefully gimmicky directing choices give the driving footage a dose of video-game-feeling and it makes them unique to watch.I certainly didn't love everything about this, but I found myself pleasantly surprised by how often I was getting wrapped up in the story and how often the filmmaking impressed me.Video game movies are getting pretty good, and I'm here for it.","

"Gran Turismo","mrwilliams-20230","21 August 2023","Gran Turismo as a game series is an accessible, arcade-leaning racing game but uses this movie to advertise itself as a true revolutionary modern simulation equal to the likes of Assetto Corsa/iRacing ect, but they also have a larger purpose of helping unappreciated gamers become professional athletes (like the protagonist always planned, apparently). This is as accurate as the rest of the movie.As a fan of gt and Le'Mans racing, I appreciated the real sponsors and tracks in the film, though spent the entire movie frustrated at the inconsistency and lies as the film reduces actual racing series to the chaos of a Gran Turismo race with deliberate crashing into each other without punishment, glorifying incorrect driving techniques and no practise/qualifying sessions. As with most car films, I forgave the drivers peering at each other mid race, the way putting the foot down with confidence makes the car way faster and an insane number of overtakes during each race, however this movie pushes it way further into cringe than many before it (for reference, I Pixar's 'Cars' does it better).Anybody with a basic knowledge of motorsport will find this a reckless waste of opportunity as the writers have lazily prioritised an audience of 10 year old gamers and their parents for a story of 'underdog gamers vs the world' rather than celebrating the amazing real story it's based on with the true intensity and drama of the sport. Many characters are ridiculous (such as how all mechanics and drivers seem to hate the so called 'sim drivers') and much of the dialogue had me laughing at the inconsistency. Key events such as the brakes 'glazing', getting rammed off the road to lose the race (he got criticised by his team!?!) and the car backflipping (due to low fuel and tyres??!?) just make this film so stupid. Had the flipping car been addressed as dirty air from the car infront or a wrong aero setup, the movie may have come off as slick, educating and intense. However, this is just a few of a million missed opportunities where a motorsport professional should have been consulted to help with the script/story. Rather than educate, this film gives kids the impression the real world of racing is like Gran Turismo, just turn up with no preparation and push the pedal harder than everyone else and you win. Absolute garbage.If you are not an insecure gamer or have a respect for sport, do not expect a good film here. This is an advertisement for Nissan and Gran Turismo without logic. It is a truly wasted opportunity to connect a great story with a great game franchise and showcase the intensity of gt and endurance series motorsport. 1.5 stars because at least it had cars going fast and real track names.","

Movies, Guardians of the Galaxy and Archie Madekwe-Midsommar, Teen Spirit.This movie is based on a true story about a video game player named Jann Mardenborough that was able to fulfill his life's dream. Archie plays Jann, a teenage kid that always loved cars and so, of course, he plays a video game called Gran Turismo every spare moment he has-it's a video game about racing. Orlando plays a marketing guy that works for Nissan and comes up with an idea about having a contest to find the best video gamer and put them behind the wheel of a real race car and have them race against professionals. When Archie wins the contest, his father, Djimon, disapproves and thinks his son should get a real job. Archie decides to go for it anyway, since it is his life dream, and David plays the trainer that is supposed to get Archie into shape, so that he might at least finish the race-David doesn't believe any of the kids can pass mustard against professionals-and I must give David props for his taste in music; he loves Black Sabbath. The racing scenes are pretty good-the real Jann Mardenborough was the stunt driver double for Archie-and there are ups and downs as far as the racing story goes, with lots of challenges . At the end, they show the real Jann and tell you his statistics.It's rated PG-13 for intense action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.If you are interested in the subject-it is an interesting story-it would be a good one to stream.","

Not all the stories are sexy enough and screen writers find themselves adding and changing the plot, in order that the story will move in an easier way to the big screen.This one is not a movie about the Gran Turismo Game - so gamers should take a pause before watching it. It is, though, a movie about a young guy who excelled at this video simulator so much he became an actual driver.This is the shell of the actual story which happened and as in a lot of other ""based on a true story"" cases, the film and its maker - Neill Blomkamp takes his artistic freedom to use other ways to tell it, in order that the audience will not fall to sleep after the first act.This one has a lot of advantages, but a high and glass ceiling, which it cannot break, as a part of a demanding genre, which only great stories or huge and talented cast could create a better environment to succeed.The story runs in a very regular manner and tells exactly what you think it would tell. Neill Blomkamp doesn't screw it up and returns after a small break from creating good movies to set a higher bar for his followers.Bloom and Harbour are great in this one and Archie Madekwe is a great surprise. Djimon Hounsou is also here and even Geri Halliwell (once Ginger Spice and today just Geri Horner) is almost unrecognized for a couple of minutes.Blomkamp film doesn't care from small characters or little plots (like the romantic story) and still manages to navigate successfully for a little bit than over two hours. If you are a fan of racing or this racing simulator - it is a must for you. The rest and even sports drama fans can see, but not as a must. Really fun time for every one who is not a big fan.","

"Gran Turismo","blatherskitenoir","25 August 2023","This is a pretty typical, feel-good, racing-champion-underdog movie. It's like it has a checklist of the standard tropes for such a movie and crosses them all off.It doesn't really push the video-gamer side of things, dwelling in that world briefly before turning into a straightforward racing flick. It's genuinely funny, it's feel-good, it's better put together than most films of it's type, and it targets your feels just enough to keep it real, but not so much that the impact lingers.The true standout here is David Harbour, playing the guerrillas chief engineer in charge of turning nerds into star athletes. He is the heart and soul of this film, and steals every scene he's in. He is so, so, so fun to watch. Watch it just for him.The perfect choice for when you want to cheer on an underdog coming out on top, without too much emotional investment.","

It is based on real-life events and condensing such a story into a movie is a commendable achievement by the director.As for games, especially video games, most of us grew up with them. Personally, I still dabble in them from time to time, and the main takeaway is the learning experience. Anyone who has spent time on a gaming console has likely encountered titles like Need for Speed and Gran Turismo. The latter, with its more realistic touch, stands out. Similarly, in the realm of movies, the Need for Speed film was a complete disaster. In contrast, the one I just watched left me thrilled, excited, and thoroughly entertained. Overall, it's a good recommended watch.","

However, leaving the theatre, I was invested into his story.Gran Turismo knows how to hit the viewer where it mattered. It pulled at our heartstrings, it gave us a character we were rooting for and it dramatized a true story without making it come off as cheesy or forced.We also had an amazing cast, with each actor providing some substance to the movie. While writing this, it is currently top 3 of the year, and I think that it'll remain high up until the end. Beautiful.","

"Gran Turismo","NS-movie-reviews","1 September 2023","First and foremost the cast of this movie was outstanding, top to bottom. I found myself absolutely head over heals for this story and those who played a part in it. What a totally, completely crazy idea this was. The energy everyone brings to the screen makes it feels as amazing as it really is.The action and racing were also outstanding. The intensity and adrenaline were palpable throughout the whole movie. Heart pounding moment after heart pounding moment.There were some elements that felt a bit lacking, like virtually no training and practice scenes once Jann becomes a real racer. He just hops from race to race, and while there are some flashes of the physical training, there is no real proof on the screen of him training racing, just actually competing. It sort of gives the feel that all of this naturally occurs to him. It would've been nice to see drills and practice laps, things like that mixed in. A big deal is also made about how he's less media presentable than other people at the camp but we never see him work on that aspect of things, either. Just some minor details missing that would've made this movie feel like a total 10/10.GREAT job to all involved! This movie deserves a lot more attention and hype. It was really something fun and heartfelt to behold!!","

"Gran Turismo","TheDanishMovie-Nerd","26 August 2023","Neil Blomkamp, a name synonymous with the sci-fi realm, has taken an audacious leap into the world of high-octane racing with ""Gran Turismo."" The transition from interstellar exploration to revving engines might seem vast, but Blomkamp's ability to ground fantastical elements in palpable reality serves him well here.The film boasts an impressive ensemble: Orlando Bloom, David Harbour, and Djimon Hounsou. While these are undoubtedly household names, it is Archie Madekwe, the fresh face amidst the veterans, who emerges as the unexpected show-stealer. His portrayal is both raw and nuanced, showing promise of a burgeoning talent ready to take Hollywood by storm.However, the movie stumbles with Orlando Bloom's performance. Despite his usually reliable prowess as an actor, Bloom disappoints with an over-the-top portrayal rife with caricature-like line deliveries. His character, which plays a significant role across all three acts, feels unfortunately two-dimensional, lacking the depth and complexity one might expect from such a pivotal figure in the narrative.Setting expectations at bay, I approached this movie hoping for something divergent from the typical racing tropes, and ""Gran Turismo"" largely delivers. Its primary flaw, besides Bloom's lackluster performance, lies in its initial pacing. The first act ambles, often feeling more like an extended prologue than an integral part of the narrative. By trimming this section, the film could've ushered viewers more quickly into the crux of its story.Madekwe and Harbour's on-screen camaraderie is a standout. Their rapport is palpable, weaving a subplot of mentorship, rivalry, and shared passion. This interpersonal drama ensures the film is more than just about cars-it's about the drivers behind the wheel and the relationships forged in the furnace of competition.When it comes to the race sequences, Blomkamp is in his element. There's a visceral realism to every drift and overtake. Integrating visual elements from the famed PlayStation simulator, he crafts racing scenes that aren't just spectacles, but narrative tools. This unique visual blend, a convergence of gaming and cinema, can likely be attributed to Blomkamp's background in marrying practicality with the fantastic in his sci-fi epics.The film's soundscape deserves a nod too. The roar of engines, the screech of tires, and the ambient sounds of racing arenas envelop the viewer, creating an immersive experience.In summary, while ""Gran Turismo"" has its flaws, particularly in Bloom's portrayal, it remains a notable experiment by Neil Blomkamp. With exhilarating race sequences, a breakthrough performance by Madekwe, and a unique visual style, ""Gran Turismo"" is a cinematic ride worth embarking on for fans of racing and drama alike.","

"Gran Turismo","sjo-15","30 August 2023","I really enjoyed this.Some of the reviews I read seemed to miss the point and not get it at all, citing too much of a mention of the game, an over powering sales reel at the beginning, too many shots of the game, etc.Its a game called Gran Turismo about a Gran Turismo player who plats lots of Gran Turismo who wins a Gran Turismo competition to go to the Gran Turismo academy to enter a competition the be a real car driver to prove that Gran Turismo players are good at driving. How one would convey that story without lots of mention of Gran Turismo, gaming, and more Gran Turismo is beyond me.I was really drawn into the story line and found it quite emotional.Its cliched. It has a failed driver, a cut throat commercial guy, a struggle against parents, last chance saloon, against all the odds - its all there as if from a manual. But its done well. It does what it says it does.Orlando Bloom is in cruise control. David Harbour's character is unlikeable. But somehow it works.Interesting that the film makers, having set the film in Cardiff, Wales, have given everyone in that location a middle class southern / greater London accent. Not one Welsh accent is shown, yet other nationalities all have an attempt at some sort of applicable accent.Anyway, relax, enjoy the ride.","

"Gran Turismo","TomTalksFilms","9 August 2023","It's fair to say that over the years video game to film adaptions have been more misses than hits. That being said this year we've had Super Mario Bros and Dungeon's & Dragons both of which were brilliant in my opinion.I'm happy to say that for me this is yet another enjoyable if yet unoriginal addition to the video game to film adaptation genre.Gran Turismo is the true story of how young Welshman Yann Mardenborough went from being one of the best Gran Turismo players to being a professional race car driver. We initially follow Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) who works as a marketing executive at Nissan and has an idea to try and market their cars towards a younger age demographic by opening a competition where by the best Gran Turismo players in the world get to compete for a chance to race professionally. This is when we go back to Yann who to his dad is a bit of a disappointment really. His dad played by Djimon Hounsou sees Yann playing Gran Turismo all the time and seems him as lazy and lacking ambition and as a result spends more time with his brother who is actively trying to become a footballer.The film then chronicles Yanns journey and what the film gave me most was a real sense of the pressure that was on this young man's shoulders at just 19 years of age. Every time he seems to deal with one problem another seems to be not far behind and by the end of the film you can't say he didn't earn his inevitable rewards. The film also does a great job of putting the viewer in the cockpit of these powerful cars and makes you feel and hear their power which only adds to the intensity when again Yann was only 19 at the time and behind the wheel of such powerful machines. The number one thing this film had to get right was the racing and director Neil Blomkamp does a great job of balancing both the real life racing experience and the video game experience into one film.As much as Archie Madekwe is brilliant as Yann, the stand out character/actor in this film is without a doubt David Harbour as Jack Salter Yanns trainer. For a start his character is the best written and over the course of the film his character really develops and without going too much into spoiler territory he starts to feel more like a dad than Yanns actual dad which in some ways isn't great as he ends up over shadowing that storyline. Jack and Yanns relationship is the heart of this film and David Harbour plays Jack almost effortlessly. Interestingly enough though after a quick Google it turns out the Jack Salter character didn't exist in real life and it's unclear who he is supposed to represent from Yanns actual story but read into that what you will.I can't recommend seeing this film on the big screen enough even if only for the incredible sound of those cars coming through the surround sound cinema speakers. It's an underdog story and one which you know the outcome of from the start but it's one that remains thoroughly enjoyable none the less.","

It has a certain emptiness to the aesthetics that makes it look one of a kind. However, Neill Blomkamp is not enough to make a good movie. The story is as basic as it can be, and it's one of those movie where some will say ""oh god this was amaaaazing"", and completely forget about it in a few days. When I say forget about it - I mean truly and sincerely forget, like they never watched it and most problably not remember any of the details.Also, it's the movie is a loooong ad for japanese cheapcars, and the only pure breed car the protagonist sat his bottom in, was 2 minute ride in a 911.","

"Gran Turismo","tlk914","26 September 2023","Overall, its a good movie,. It has some character building, it tells a fun inspirational story that is based on a real person, and it has a happy ending. A poor mans modern day version of Rocky.. The kid from the video game world (Rocky was from the tough streets of Philly) wins a tournament and gets a chance to drive real race cars. Aside from the ""he was a video gamer"" background, the script follows a dozen previous racing movies verbatim. Amazingly talented rookie unknown appears out of nowhere, gets paired with a gruff veteran with personal baggage, has a big crash that shakes him, but in the end comes back and wins the big race! See DAYS OF THUNDER and change the names.This semi-true story did sorta happen though. Not quite the way it was shown. Jann Mardenborogh was not the 1st ever winner of Nissan Academys online tournament. He didnt actually arrive till year 4 and 3 other ""winners"" with less dramatic stories preceded him. (It wasnt the only racing academy in the world and not only gamers were there). Also, Jann Mardenborough did not win at Le Mans in a thrilling photo finish. His team 1 year finished 3rd in class. 3rd is a very respectable amazing achievement, Le Mans is the endurance trial of all racing, many cars and drivers fail to finish even in multiple attempts. But 3rd is not a photo finish victory as it was portrayed.But fact bending aside, the actors carry it off well, the racing is more video game feel portrayed than putting the audience in the seat of the car but considering their theme thats fine.Overall it was fun and inspiring and worth the watch.","

"Gran Turismo","Hey_Harry","20 August 2023","Based on the real-life success story of Jann Mardenborough whose driving skills in the Gran Turismo video game series carried Jann over into the realm of professional auto racing, Blomkamp's ""Gran Turismo"" falls somewhere between being a video game adaptation and being a biographical film about the game itself. Interestingly, ""Gran Turismo"" has a few elements in common with Jon S. Baird's biographical ""Tetris"" film released earlier this year. Both are biographical movies which center around a particular video game but both films also come up with fairly creative ways to incorporate visuals from the games into the film's narrative and very successfully so. With that being said, Blomkamp's ""Gran Turismo"" contains plenty of fast-paced, intense car-racing along with an emotionally gripping story backed up by Blomkamp's top-notch directing. Highly recommended for Gran Turismo and professional car racing enthusiasts alike!","

"Gran Turismo","acdc_mp3","23 December 2023","I became familiar with Gran Turismo when I gave my son his PlayStation 1 back in 1998. A demo version of the game came with it. Even back then, the graphics were amazing well done and the whole vibe of the game was very realistic in the fact you had to learn the courses and lines you drove to maximize your performance. With the vastly improved gaming consoles, graphics and sounds, it stands to reason that the hand to eye and timing aspects of racing could translate to real racing. The main difference is the physical toll that actual driving takes on the human body. I have raced go-karts a long time ago and after driving 100 laps, you are sweaty and spent mass of humanity. I felt like I played 2 football games back to back when I got out of that cart.This movie was well written and performed without being sappy and predictable. The emotions displayed were heartfelt and realistic. This leads to my final portion of my review. Back in 1979 there was a movie called ""Breaking Away"" which entailed a young man who was obsessed with bicycle racing. All he wanted to do was race against his heroes the Cinzano Racing Team from Italy and when he does, it does not pan out well for him. To make matters worse, he is a townie in a snobby college town where he is looked down upon by the college types and his own father.Just like Breaking Away, Gran Turismo has a storyline of difficulty, self-doubt, pain, sorrow, excitement and a final race where the odds are against the hero.Anyone who has seen Breaking Away and Gran Turismo will know exactly what I mean when I say this was a great movie where you will be cheering at the end.See it.","

"Gran Turismo","classicsoncall","20 December 2023","Who in their right mind would ever consider a gamer to actually get behind the wheel of a race car for real? Apparently, a Nissan marketing executive came up with that brainstorm, and well, I guess you could say the rest is history. Improbable as it might have been to pull off, teen Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe) answered a call from the Nissan motor company to participate in an on-line simulated race and come out victorious among a field of ten other contestants. Then it was on to Tokyo for exhaustive training and a chance to crack the highly competitive field of auto racing. I liked David Harbour in this one, portraying a mechanic and former driver himself who was able to admit that his fear after crashing at Le Mans curtailed his own racing career. Attempting to instill the fear of God and the devil both into the minds of the potential drivers, Jack Salter (Harbour) was eventually won over by the tenacity and competitive spirit of his young protégé. It's not all smooth sailing however; it took six qualifying races for Jann to make the cut, needing to finish no lower than fourth in a sanctioned race in order to get a professional license. A sensational crash on a German track almost derailed his dream, but for the foresight of Salter who forced him to face up to the setback and move forward. In the grand tradition of underdog sports films, this is another inspiring story in a milieu unfamiliar to most, but you don't have to be a race car fan to enjoy the spectacle. Just buckle up and take that exhilirating ride with jann Mardenborough as he achieves the impossible, never once making it look easy.","

"Gran Turismo","CinemaSerf","25 August 2023","Archie Madekwe is quite good here as the gamer Jann Mardenborough who entered a competition devised by Nissan marketing man Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) to raise the profile of their sports cars in a league usually dominated by the likes of Porsche and Ferrari etc. There's a great degree of cynicism from the high-pressure, high-octane, industry that these glorified couch potatoes could ever make the grade, but with the help of slightly jaded but experienced coach Jack Salter (David Harbour) they decide to push these youngsters to their limits. What now ensues is based on fact, so we have little jeopardy to the ultimate denouement. That said, though, Neill Blomkamp manages to build the momentum well with some excellent action photography to get the adrenalin pumping. Neither Bloom nor Harbour are really here nor there, but the young Madekwe does manage to exude some of the grit and determination of his ambitious, fiercely competitive, and dedicated persona and it's been quite a while since I heard the dulcets of Enya emanate from a big screen. It does take a little while to get out of neutral - maybe just a bit too much familial scene setting to justify the fees of Geri Horner and Djimon Hounsou but once we escape that, the thing picks up entreatingly and is quite a thrill a times to watch. Definitely better on a big screen.","

Drama is flat as a pancake. Virtually all the characters, all the happenings in the movie are meaningless. Action scenes are really lousy. LeMans 66 is like a masterpiece compared to this. The movie just jumps all the time to different scenes and brings very little of information about the main character and how he is developing from zero to hero. And that should be the point of this movie. A zero to hero movie. But it's not that. It's totally uninteresting commercial movie.","

"Gran Turismo","Pjtaylor-96-138044","12 September 2023","I distinctly remember thinking, at one point or another during the first act of 'Gran Turismo (2023)', ""is this the worst thing I've ever seen?"". It's obviously not, of course, but the first movement really must be rough if it inspires that line of thinking. I specify ""first movement"" because, thankfully, the picture picks up the slack once the gamers finally start to become racers. Suddenly, what's a serviceable and often unbearably corporate (any time it tries to tie into the eponymous video game - err, racing simulator - in particular) affair is transformed into a thoroughly enjoyable rags-to-riches experience. The director's cited influences of 'Rocky (1976)' and 'Top Gun (1986)' are so obvious that the link has likely already be made in your mind before the credits have rolled. That isn't a bad thing, though, and the fact that the feature sticks to its formula so confidently is arguably the reason it works so well, as it doesn't need to worry about reinventing the wheel rather than doing the best it can with what is expected of it (though this is slightly ironic given the protagonist's tenuous relationship with the rigid racing line provided by the developers of the game he so covets). The racing sequences are generally exciting and suspenseful. Even if they pretty much all play out exactly as you anticipate, they somehow manage to get you on the edge of your seat before they plaster a smile on your face. A lot of the flick's success comes down to the genuinely great David Harbour, whose enthusiastic performance really anchors the often cheesy narrative and is just a blast to watch in general. Archie Madekwe puts in dependable, if fairly unremarkable, work as the protagonist - whose unbelievable yet (mostly) true real-life story provides the basis for the narrative - and Djimon Hounsou delivers the goods when it comes to his small yet significant role. Orlando Bloom is on another planet, somehow simultaneously providing both the best and worst performance in the entire affair; it's a treat whenever he turns up on screen. Ultimately, despite a weak first act and a slightly indulgent runtime, this is an entertaining and effective crowd-pleaser that does what you expect but does it surprisingly well. It's far more fun than it ought to be (and, indeed, than its overplayed trailers would suggest).","

After some challenges, Jann is invited to participate in real car racing on behalf of the game and car manufacturer Nissan.Nissan producer Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) and former racer Jack Salter (David Harbour) who now works as a mechanical engineer must train and prepare the gamers for real car racing. Nissan and other sponsors are trying to make their brands more popular and hope to eventually earn more. However, Jann tries to win more to show that he has also managed to make a career out of following his car racing passion, despite all the people who don't believe in this, such as his father Steve (Djimon Hounsou).With this film they show how video games can influence the lives of players later on. By playing a racing game, Jann Mardenborough later really got into car racing. Despite the fact that people who do not or hardly play games themselves usually have a poor image of people who do game, this film still shows the benefits of gaming. For example, gamers who play Cal of Duty could later join the army with real military training. Or people who play Just Dance could break through as provisional dancers.Neill Blomkamp managed to break through in the film world with his first two directorial works, but then lost some of his success. He seems to be making a comeback with this film, because he portrays the film well. Gamers who are familiar with the Gran Turismo games can also recognize some images and game tactics that they themselves have seen or used in the game before. Furthermore, he also shows the differences with how real racers and gamer racers can look at a race. In this way he also shows how the different parties compete in a race. Thus, this film is entertaining for fans of racing sports as well as the racing game.The story is unfortunately a bit less balanced. In addition to the real story, the screenwriters were also inspired by the films Rocky and Top Gun and tried to put the story on the same level. Unfortunately, they concentrate this film more on the racing game, sports and training, so that the family aspects are somewhat lost in the background. All the time you spend with Jann's family and friends sometimes seems a bit unnecessary. Jann actually has a better relationship with his trainer than with his father in the film, because the film brings out this bond more. The film actually wastes Djimon Hounsou's time and acting talent. The same thing happens with Geri Horner, the Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls, who plays Jann's mother. The best acting comes from the bond between Archie Madekwe and David Harbour, who play characters who come from different sides, but still try to achieve the same end result. Orlando Bloom also plays his role well, but his character cares a little more about financial success than Jann's real sport or health. The real Jann Mardenborough actually performs the stunts himself and also serves as a stuntman for Archie Madekwe. Fortunately, this change is not clearly reflected in the film.","

"Gran Turismo","v1gg3n","17 February 2024","As a long time fan of motorsports this movie is woefully bad and almost impossible to watch. I can understand someone not invested in real-life motorsports enjoying this film, but the amount of cringe I felt hearing the race engineer explaining to Jann how to drive Le Mans on lap 1 of the race as if he hadn't been there for a week doing practice sessions and qualifying for the race?! Let alone time in the simulator?! Made it incredibly difficult to suspend my disbelief. This is just one example. I love Blomkamp, but man I wish he'd done a bit more research before presenting this film to the public. Please take this review with a grain of salt, as I am sure you will find this movie enjoyable if you do not follow motorsports in real life.","

"Gran Turismo","cjonesas","29 October 2023","A wonderful movie for all race cars and 1966 beetle lovers alike. It carries superb everything, but the best ones are the flow & vibe, photography, camera works, race engine revving sounds and the near outstanding visual / computer effects.It is based on a true story and that makes it all the more outstanding. In all the cast's acting, I especially loved David Harbour's charismatic, intense play, while Orlando Bloom's one was only thinking about success at all costs, compromise and money-bringing fame. Special kudos to Djimon Hounsou who played the father realistically and with emotions and Archie Madekwe who portrayed Jann Mardenborough with softness, determination and wittiness.Before watching it, I didn't imagine Gran Turismo to be that good, intense and adrenaline pumping.

This was an excellent race film I don't agree with the video game streak continuing this is more professional and great entertainment value that might even surprise you!

It's definitely a feel good main character wins movie but they keep you engaged the entire time. Some of the scenes had my heart racing as if I were behind the steering wheel.The movie was well done and there were dozens of little details that I really appreciate, like the hazy vision before a big race. It did feel like it was missing a few things to make it better, and maybe less drama and more racing. It is up there with Ford vs Ferrari. It had action, love, suspense, emotions, and adrenaline. I would watch again.Did I mention I watched in dbox? I rarely do dbox but I figured this would be the right movie for it.","

"Gran Turismo","04GreatFlick","20 August 2023","Great movie. Starts off a little slow. The narrative requires significant setup, which might feel a bit slow initially, but once it gains momentum, it becomes quite engaging. The storyline becomes highly enjoyable from that point onwards. The movie is sprinkled with numerous instances that pay homage to the game series, presenting various cleverly placed Easter eggs. Although uncertain whether this will be retained in the final version, the screening I attended included an awesome behind-the-scenes montage featuring the actual driver who serves as the inspiration for the movie. Visually, the film is captivating and avoids any semblance of goofiness or such. I believe this movie would truly shine in a premium format. The intricate sound mixes and effects present in the film would undoubtedly be elevated and enriched by the enhanced audio and visual quality of premium formats. David Harbour, Djimon Hounsou, and Orlando Bloom deliver outstanding performances in this film. Each of them brings a captivating intensity to their respective roles, infusing their characters with a remarkable depth that enriches the overall narrative. I really enjoyed this movie. Hoping to catch it again in a premium format. Good job Sony! Bringing a video game to movie is challenging and this was a great entry! Good Flick!","

"Gran Turismo","nscoby93","12 August 2023","I am very pleasantly surprised with how this turned out. While I anticipated the score, I would end up giving it. I didn't expect how good it would be.So I'll just start with how good it was. The story was good, the writing was solid, and the acting was solid with David Harbour, in my opinion, being the best in the film. The cinematography and sound design were great.But where this film shines is in its depictions of the video game and racing sequences and how they merge the video game racing with the actual racing. The camera angles for the races were great and very akin to camera angles you'd have in the game. Then, in certain sequences, they implement the games hud in the real life racing, which was great. I also must mention the PlayStation sounds they applied at certain moments in the film they were fun, and they made my friend and I giggle.Unfortunately though the film also suffers from a number of things. The story has some strong moments, but it also had moments of dullness. Such as the romantic interest subplot, which was whatever I felt it wasn't needed, some cliches like the other racers treating Jann like crap and he doesn't get respect until he proved himself. Some moments of dialogue were weird too and at times came off as weak writing. Finally, this actor who played Jann (Archie Madekwe) he never quite sold me on him. I don't think he's a bad actor. I just couldn't really connect with him like I did with David Harbour's character Jack, whom I think was the better written character.Nonetheless, the film had a fantastic third act, which made up for a lot of the things I didn't care for in the second. This was also the second film I've ever seen that depicted the 24-hour race of Le Mans. The other being Ford v Ferrari, which after watching this, I now want to watch that again. The whole race at Le Mans was shot fantastically and was exciting to watch on the big screen.Overall, I genuinely enjoyed this film. While I think it may be a little long, it entertains and depicts an inspirational true story of chasing your dreams.IMDb: 7/10

"Gran Turismo","TharsheyN","22 October 2023","Gran Turismo (2023) is based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough and roars onto the screen in a high-octane spectacle that's sure to rev up the hearts of racing enthusiasts and gamers around the world.The heart of the film lies in the world of simulator style gaming and it's possible transition to real world results like the Gran Turismo game to real life competitive racing, and it's a sight to behold. The story is beautifully woven around a talented young racer, Jann Mardenborough (played by Archie Madekwe), who takes you on a thrilling journey from the starting line to the finish. The intense rivalries, high-speed races, and the pulse-pounding action create a captivating narrative.The cast delivers outstanding performances. Archie Madekwe's portrayal of Jann Mardenborough, his struggles, and his triumphs on the racetrack feel genuine and emotionally charged. The supporting cast is littered with brand names like Orlando Bloom (Legolas from LOTR) who plays Danny Moore, David Harbour who plays Jack Salter and Jann's parents Leslie (Geri Halliwell) and Steve Mardenborough (Djimon Hounsou) also contributes massively to the success of the film, adding depth and realism to the story with their incredible performances.The visual and sound effects in Gran Turismo are nothing short of spectacular. The racing sequences are visually stunning and packed with adrenaline-pumping action. The roaring engines, screeching tires, and the overall atmosphere of the racing world are captured with remarkable precision, enhancing the film's impact. I for one also really liked the way the filmmakers blended the real world racing sequences with the game of Gran Turismo. Some may not like the blending of real world and game visuals but I think it worked out pretty good for them.Overall a 9/10 from me as Gran Turismo delivers a thrilling cinematic experience for car and racing enthusiasts, gamers and fans of Jann Mardenborough. The exceptional performances and adrenaline pumping races will have you at the edge of your seat for sure. Also did you know but Jann Mardenborough himself is the stunt double for Archie Madekwe who plays him in the film, so all the racing sequences you see are done by Jann Mardenborough himself. You'll want to buckle up and take this one for a spin, and it might just have you returning for another lap.","

"Gran Turismo","masonfisk","12 September 2023","A current video game cum film adaptation currently in theaters. Based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough, played by See's Archie Madekwe, a young Londoner obsessed w/the titular Playstation videogame soon gets the chance of a lifetime when Nissan, personified by a hungry PR rep essayed by Orlando Bloom, sponsors a contest to recruit gamers to drive honest to goodness cars. Soon enough youths from various parts of the world converge to train in real racecars under the tutelage of a once famous race car whisperer, played by David Harbour, who quickly dumps cold buckets of water on their hopes when he lets them know the contest is a survival of the fittest where only one racer can end up competing. Madekwe makes the grade but then has to finish in a particular slot in order to qualify for the remaining seasonal races which gets halted when his car crashes causing the death of a spectator. Will Madekwe man up for the final race & dispel the notion that he can't cut it? Coming from Neill Blomkamp (Elysium/Chappie) I was bit worried since his last foray was 2021's God awful Demonic (which I would forgive a bit since it was made during lockdown) but for what the film turned out to be it was much better than I expected as I got involved in our hero's plight w/his caring parents, Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou & Ginger Spice herself, Geri Halliwell, bringing in much gravitas to their scenes.","

"Gran Turismo","rek425","25 August 2023","The movie is a battle between two groups of people, the protagonists who think that sim racing can teach you real racing, and the antagonists who think it can't.This is deeply confusing to anybody who knows anything about either. Real professional racing drivers have been relying on sim racing for training and practice for 20+ years now. Not only is sim racing helpful for real racing, it's an essential component, and everybody has known that for a long time. So basically, the point of the movie is a conflict that simply doesn't exist, and it's just going to confuse a lot of people.Second, the movie is full of situations that are so deeply unrealistic that the race cars might as well be turning into elephants while being driven on the track.Like when the team coach starts telling the driver about his on-track competition literally while the race is starting... as if they hadn't been studying the competition for days/weeks before the race.Or when the racing driver requests special permission to deviate from the ideal racing line, as if that isn't an integral part of competitive racing that happens several times per lap.Or when the racing driver's own teammates throw verbal jabs at him for only being a ""sim racer""... uhh, aren't they on the same team? Who would insult the driver you're RELYING ON to do well? It's so weird.This review might seem like a bunch of nitpicking by somebody who fancies himself an expert, but car racing is a popular thing and a lot of people know about it. Tens of millions of people play car racing simulators on game consoles, tens of millions of people watch ""Drive To Survive"" on Netflix, etc. Etc. And this movie is going to feel very foreign, confusing, and fake to them.","

"Gran Turismo","steveinadelaide","20 August 2023","I recently had a surprising experience at the cinema. I saw Gran Turismo with low expectations, assuming it would be a typical teen movie focused on gaming. However, the film turned out to be a thrilling and engaging experience.Although Gran Turismo is based on a car racing game, the film focuses on the true story of Jann Mardenborough's early career. Mardenborough, a gamer, is given the opportunity to compete in the Nissan GT Academy, with the potential to transition into professional racing. The plot is captivating and kept me invested in the story from beginning to end.Archie Madekwe's portrayal of Mardenborough was convincing and demonstrated the character's passion and determination. The supporting cast was also strong, adding depth to the story. Neill Blomkamp's direction was excellent, capturing the excitement and intensity of car racing. The racing scenes were well done, with camera angles and editing highlighting the beauty and power of the race cars. The special effects were realistic and never distracting.The movie's editing was tight, and the story moved along at a brisk pace. The dialogue was well-written and believable, adding depth to the characters and the relationships between them. The movie touched on themes of determination and perseverance as Mardenborough overcomes obstacles to achieve his goal of becoming a professional racer.While Gran Turismo may not break new ground in the racing movie genre, it is a well-made and exciting film. Overall, I highly recommend Gran Turismo to those who enjoy racing movies or want to experience a thrilling film.","

It was just a great, well done mainstream film which probably explains why so many stuffy critics rated it so lowly.

Despite the concerns of turning a car racing game into a movie starring a former Spice Girl, I was pleasantly surprised by the end result. So, it exceeded my concerning low expectations. Firstly, they did a nice job of incorporating some of the game's specific graphics and sound effects into the movie. I also watched the original documentary of searching for the best gamer turned real life driver but had never learned how their potential careers turned out. This movie pieced that together a bit for me. There were some surprisingly solid emotional acting scenes without expecting anything of Al Pacino caliber, but it worked well. The racing scenes were entertaining but a discerning racing fan will spot how they turned an actual 24-Hour de Le Mans racing crash into a more glamorized version and the racing was a bit movie tweaked vs real life.

"Gran Turismo","bsqgmsyt","23 October 2023","It's often said that the magic of cinema lies in its ability to transport the audience into different worlds, realities, and emotions. Sadly, ""Gran Turismo"" seems to have missed that memo entirely. As a film adaptation of one of the most beloved video game franchises, one would expect a seamless blend of high-octane racing and compelling narrative. Instead, what we get is a poorly executed, cringeworthy attempt at storytelling that leaves the viewer wondering how it ever got the green light.Firstly, let's address the elephant in the room: the acting. To say it's subpar would be an understatement. The performances are so wooden, they make a plank look versatile. Characters lack depth and dimension, making it exceedingly hard for the audience to form any emotional connection. The actors seem almost as lost as the audience, unsure whether they're in a drama, an action flick, or an unintentional comedy.The dialogue doesn't help either. Clichéd lines and awkward exchanges proliferate throughout the film, often inducing secondhand embarrassment. It's as if the script was stitched together last-minute without any thought for how human beings actually communicate. Conversations feel forced, serving only as a shaky bridge from one racing sequence to the next, making it all too evident that the film prioritizes style over substance.In conclusion, ""Gran Turismo"" is a misfire on many levels. From the lackluster acting to the cringe-inducing dialogue, the film is a lesson in how not to adapt a video game into a movie. It lacks the finesse, excitement, and engagement that both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike would expect. All in all, this is one ride you're better off skipping.","

"Gran Turismo","arungeorge13","5 October 2023","The entirety of Gran Turismo's first act is soulless. There's nothing you haven't seen before in the first 75-80 minutes, which basically goes through the motions. The product placement is clearly in your face, and it's only the supporting presence of David Harbour and Orlando Bloom, especially the former, that keeps it afloat. The arc (rise-setback-redemption) is one you'd see in pretty much every sports drama. Neill Blomkamp, who started off with an incredible District 9, with subsequent films fetching diminishing returns (emotionally, that is), is going through a redeeming arc of his own. His flair for stylized action is one that I personally love, and he uses it to great effect here. There's stuff here that GT enthusiasts will love, and of course, there's some that they'll shake their heads on.The cinematic hook of the film comes around the 80th minute, right when the setback aspect is in full swing. Luckily for the makers, it registers pretty damn well. While the writers have taken some creative liberties regarding the playout of some events in real life, it definitely molds the film into a better experience. Blomkamp chooses to end the film on an adrenaline-rushing, emotionally heavy high of sorts, preceded by a brilliant Le Mans set-piece. The gamer-to-racedriver transition is one that needs more discussions, at least on a platform like LB. Blomkamp is definitively a very stylistic director, and that can be both a boon and a curse. If the first act could've been less generic (from a writing perspective) and more moving (from an emotional perspective), I guess this would've been a complete winner. In its current form, it's still fairly enjoyable. Special shoutout to cinematographer Jacques Jouffret!","

"Gran Turismo","rgkarim","26 August 2023","LIKES:Music:
-The movie has a killer soundtrack to support the movie and I loved the choices in songs and the span of genres that they chose.-Two songs by unlikely artists are used in a humorous way that was not overdone, while other tracks bring that vibe of the race course and city they are in.-Add a fantastic orchestral work that brings the spirit and heart of the engine of this automobile movie sealed the deal and mixed so well with the other tracks picked.-The combination is fantastic and really is an underplayed quality, but I found it quite refreshing with what they accomplished.The Sound Editing:
-One of my favorite parts of the movie, Gran Turismo has the sound to bring the big racing circuit to life.-The full octane rush of the cars lights up the theater, sometimes too blazing levels, but in doing so the scenes comes to life in spades and makes it wonderful.-Meanwhile, the group is able to speak clearly, bringing their full vibe to the mix and not pulling any punches to give you the full impact of the victory this movie has.-And the fact that everything moves around so good... well, it again works super well for me and I quite enjoyed having everything crisp, clear, and executed so well as the cars go to work on the track.The Story:
-For the most part, the movie has got props for being based on a true story.-An engaging story about an odd situation and an incredible opportunity, it's got bites of the video game with a dramatic persona that blends well together to make a great presentation.-And it has elements that extend past racing with character development, romance, self-discovery, and more, offering a wonderful variety of things that I think people will really enjoy.-And it moves well with still allotting time to some key moments, helping to put it all in a nice package that was fun and easy to follow.-It holds a lot of depth, and the presentation really brings things together in a way that takes this story to a more fun element that is very fun and engaging. The three parts of the movie give you the whole ordeal with great transitions from opening training to the parts of the career.The Acting:
-A solid cast makes up this team, with performances that aren't stiff for the most part, but surprisingly fun and holding quality that far exceeds most movies in this genre.-Madekwe is a solid lead character, strong, emotional, and classy that feels very classy and yet approachable. He forms a solid lead with a direction to really shine and I quite enjoyed the character
-Bloom may not be slinging arrows and killing orcs, but the man knows how to take a role and sell it with might. His accent, his urgency, and his focus on being this complicated assistant establish some fun relationship dynamics I think works well.-And Harbour is the man with the plan, again, and quite worth the investment in this movie. He takes the comedy, the heart, and the tenson and blends it into a level reminiscent of Denzel Washington in Remember the Titans and makes for an amazing character to anchor everything together.-It's a crew that really comes together and unleashes a fantastic dynamic that had me invested, laughing, and really engaging with me in every minute of the film.The Racing Scenes:
-It's a movie about a racing game, and that means we need to see some cars flying at fast speeds in death defying turns.-You got it! Turismo's presentation is all about capturing the moment and it does it beautifully with the sound effect mentioned earlier.-But more than that, the movie's visuals help to make the movie shine even more.-The cars are beautiful, one part CGI with very polished looks and most of it legitimate cars racing with style, flair, and stunt drivers pulling the moves.-A dynamic camera work helps next to bring the race to life, finding the right moments to switch between in the cab and out to maximize the tension and excitement.-Throw in various angles to show the race and give you the play by play of every exciting move in the Turismo set up.-Add the interludes by the characters, with great mike work, engaging conversations, and bringing the full picture as they all work to establish the rivalry and you have a presentation that really sells the racing scenes.-And to be honest it's like the video game meets Ford Vs. Ferrari and it really works in terms of the spectacle and story, elevating the movie to a higher quality that I thoroughly enjoyed watching and feel adds a lot more variety to the racing movie.-All those qualities and enough of the racing parameters again gives you a great feel without bombarding you with just turning like a NASCAR race.DISLIKES:So Many Characters, So Little Time
-The movie is loaded with a lot of people who influenced the driver's life, and I had liked to have seen more given the star studded cast.-While the movie handles it's time very well, the movie is loaded with so many characters and talented actors that I wanted more of each of them and seeing more into what they did.-Like Ford Vs. Ferrari, so many people brought an impossible dream to life. So I would have liked to see the various pieces continue to click as the movie continued.-Harbour and Madekwe have this great set of moments that are perfect, but Bloom's part is kind of there, but not to the degree I had expected to see.-The romantic and family involvements also take a little more of a backseat than I had wanted, and hoped for a bit more of that adventure, alongside the friends he made as well.-Even the rivalry needed a tad more tuning up, adding a bit more establishment, dialogue, and flair that felt like it was there, but ended up in the shop and missing the final cut.The Story Is Very Similar:
-I get it is limited to real life events, but the movie has a lot of the Ford Vs. Ferrari feel once the second and third acts come to life.-While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it does take out the unique feel, even some of the racing venues the same presentation as the Oscar level film, so that might be a tad annoying for some reviewers.More Racing:
-Once more because of time, Gran Turismo takes the wheel and turns it into a couple of montages to cut corners.-This isn't as bad as some other films, bringing a few elements, Harbour's reactions, and a kicking soundtrack to the mix to help, thus still making it fun.-Yet, the movie could have had a little more time showing him some moves in these scenes, seeing him improve and having a little more dialogue after some of the big moments to really spice it up.-The final event itself has a lot of things thrown together, and though the last part is astounding, the movie again misses some moments and dramatic additions that could have really taken it to the high levels.-That finesse and finish would have matched some of the higher tier reviews, but still not bad at all.The VERDICT:
Gran Turismo may be another video game movie, but to my surprise, this may be one of the best adaptations I have seen in a very long time between two media. It has acting that is amazing, with a strong cast to bring the words and events to life and keep you engaged far past a racing movie. The movie does a nice job of bringing the drama and other facets of life into the mix to create an engaging character, balancing out this amazing man's life beyond what he can do behind a wheel. But as this is a racing game movie, the racing components are indeed the heart of this movie and Hollywood has done well to immerse you into the film. Great sound effects that shake the theater, a fantastic recreation of the races with awesome stunt driving and CGI mixed beautifully, and dynamic filming that rings out just how good a movie like this can be. It's really a wonderful ride that a theater visit is totally worth. And yet, this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea. A similar story to an even bigger hit, the movie sort of pulls punches when it comes to the characters, racing development, and dynamics that help elevate these pieces. Had it not been for a time crunch, I feel we could have sped away from the generic pace, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, just something those looking for more unique factor would look for. Still, I recommend this movie and really found it to be one of the better surprises that cracked my top 10 for the year. My scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0.","

"Gran Turismo","PerryAtTheMovies","10 August 2023","8.1/10Super early screening of ""Gran Turismo"" that I only just found out about last night so I had to take advantage. Absolutely amazing film! I've never been a fan of the video game because I suck at it, but seeing someone who's actually fantastic at the game succeed and excel was phenomenal to see. I'm also not a car guy, but that doesn't matter to enjoy this one.I'll be looking up the story after this review so right now I don't know how true, or embellished, the story is, but obviously this guy has made a name for himself in the motorsport world as is shown between the movies ending and the credits.The visuals for this film are outstanding. They did a great job bringing you into the car, and giving a good illusion of being in the drivers seat. The sound was incredible as if you were part of the action. Emotionally you're drawn and pushed out. My heart was racing so much through the entirety. I figured the story had a good ending otherwise why create such a film, but not knowing how the end result is achieved was nerve wracking. It's been awhile since a film has made me this emotional and passionate.A few downsides are continuity errors, some visuals not feeling real or graphical, and time slowing down too much thus causing some distraction to take place, but overall I think this is a must see in theatres. It has character, quality, emotional impact, and a well-rounded storyline. It feels real.That's all for now. Thank you for reading my review, and until next time.... Enjoy the show!","

This year, it was Gran Turismo.This is the best racing movie since Days of Thunder and Talledega Nights.I'm serious.I don't even care that it's a video game. I didn't even know it was a video game.It's like the race cars in the film. It's fast. Sleek. Stylish and cool.The last race car video game I remember was Pole Position.It's got a stellar cast all snug perfectly in their parts. Orlando Bloom, Djimon. Hounsou, David Harbour and Ginger Spice as one of the hottest moms ever in cinema.Also directed by Neill Blomkamp. This is his best film since District 9. And I loved District 9.I winced when I saw the run time of this movie.Two hours and fifteen minutes for a movie about a video game?Does not anybody have any restraint in the film industry anymore?But, I can report here from the pits that it goes quickly. A lap or two around the track is all.It's got an inspiring story, a sweet little love story, and lots and lots of high speed race and chase, paint-swapping action.I loved it.In the end, you'll want a sporty Nissan, and to follow this particular brand of motor car racing.And you'll want some champagne.Make that a beer.Champagne is for the podium.","

"Gran Turismo","Elvis-Del-Valle","29 August 2023","Based on a PlayStation video game, Gran Turismo does not go to the trouble of being a video game adaptation just like that, but opts instead to be a biographical film of a gamer who just by playing Gran Turismo had the opportunity to fulfill his dream of be a racer and go far. When it seems that playing video games is nothing more than a waste of time, the story that this film tells shows the opposite and that in the end being a gamer does have a job opportunity. It is a very good dramatic story about how, sometimes by luck or by fate, an opportunity to reach a dream that at first seemed to be impossible presents itself. The whole film shows us this journey that Jann had to undertake in his goal as a future car racer. The movie is very easy to follow and has emotional moments that manage to connect with Jann and his trainer Jack. The race car sequences are very good and build excitement as Jann competes for his new calling. Gran Turismo is definitely one of the best sports and biographical movies ever made and is somewhat unique among many movies that have been made based on video games. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.","

"Gran Turismo","Amanda2021","30 December 2023","Our entire family liked which includes a 12 and 16 year old, me and my husband. It is an inspirational story. He is from working class family has big dreams which seem impossible, against the odds kind of thing. Main character actor was very believable and likable. Made you want to root for him. Others did great too, 2nd racer was very believable in his cocky role. Had veteran actors Djimon Hounsou and Orlando Bloom, always great. Def add to lineup of inspirational sports movies, if you like the based on true story ones, you will like it. No vulgarity but some intensity with the racing, crashes and without spoiling just know there are a couple extreme moments, may need to talk with younger kids about but it is a dangerous sport. While my teens liked, I think younger or even older would like as well. First movie I have seen like this that involves young people from so many countries, I like that, and would enjoy more of them, especially because our world is already so interconnected. So thank you to the movie studios and game. Never heard of this until Netflix, which is a shame, would have been cool to see in theaters. Seems like they need to market movies more equally.","

So I went in with a good dose of skepticism... and boy was I wrong. This is a fantastic movie, regardless of its source material. The writing is excellent, acting absolutely on point, and the directing is brilliant with of course fantastic racing scenes.

"Gran Turismo","kjproulx","5 September 2023","Everything about this film is interesting to me. The fact that it's based on a true story, while being a film based around a video game, and it's actually very good? Colour me surprised. I had no recollection of this true story ever happening, so the entire film was fresh for me. Sure, it's a little cliched and streamlined, but I can usually give all of that a pass when it's a true story and well-made. Here are the reasons I thoroughly enjoyed Gran Turismo.Revolving around Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), Gran Turismo tells the story of how he is ridiculed by his family for playing Gran Turismo on his Playstation console with all of his free time. With hopes of becoming a real driver, he is given the opportunity to qualify for a contest being put on by Nissan. After qualifying, his dreams of becoming a real racer and racing with the best drivers in the world quickly become a reality. Coached by Jack Salter (David Harbour), who believes none of these players can compete in a real race adds a level realism (and humour) as well.From being compelling on a narrative and emotional level (I even teared up multiple times), to being absolutely thrilling throughout each and every racing sequence, and being well-directed by Neil Blomkamp, I didn't have many complaints here. I was actually very pleased to see Blomkamp directing his first truly great film since District 9 (in my opinion). My only gripes are the fact that it may feel slightly long at times and the fact that it plays out in a formulaic way, but it's still great. If formulaic bothers you even if something is well put together, then that's really the only reason I wouldn't recommend this film to you.Gran Turismo packs emotional punches and gives you a very satifying conclusion as well. David Harbour is the standout for me (as always), as the burnout driver who coaches these young adults. His charisma here and chemistry with Archie Madekwe was fantastic. I was engaged and enjoying this film from start to finish and I highly recommend checking it out. At its core, it's a father/son story and that aspect sold the movie on top of all the other elements I liked. It's just a very good time at the movies.","

I can understand why they changed the timeline with Nürburgring crash.But Le Mans is a different case.To context Le mans is the most prestigious race in history.And to say that a LMP2 (which is not top class) Nissan broke the absolute lap record of Le Mans is utterly outrageous.And the audacity to use the exact lap time originally set by Kamui Kobayashi with TOYOTA (rival of Nissan) is just unbelievable.There's a limit you should never cross when altering History. And this film clearly didn't respect History or other manufacturers.As a Racing Fan it's hurtful to see.","

A once in a lifetime opportunity offered by Nissan along with chief engineer Jack Salter. It follows Jann's personal life and his initial days at the Academy prepping to become the profession racer, he is destined to be. Taking through the various championships and challenges he has to overcome to prove his worth at Le Mans.I have never played Gran Turismo or followed this story. It started off well, shedding light on Jann's personal life, introducing his parents and brother, his dynamic with his disapproving father till wins his ticket to GT Academy by winning the race in the video game, beating the several best. It got really interesting once the training episode started at the Academy, aided by ever dependable David Harbour as Jack Salter. There were stand out moments here to establish Jann's character as a natural.The film's pace drops once Jann's character gets his licence and the screenplay gets a bit repetitive. The real life crash experience is inserted here to amp up the drama and the slow pace just adds upto the runtime. The final act revolving around 24hr race at Le Mans is where the film picks up and it does offer few generic scenes here that are serviceable. Although the film never reaches the high which the initial hour had. Overall it was still a decent watch aided by good performances by Archie Madekwe as Jann Mardenborough, David Harbour and even Orlando Bloom as Danny Moore.","

"Gran Turismo","Picturesinflow","15 October 2023","In Gran Turismo, we follow the story of Jahn Mardenborough (portrayed by Archie Madekwe), an enthusiastic player of Gran Turismo (the video game) whose dream is to one day race like the virtual champions. Luck smiles upon him when an intriguing opportunity presents itself. Danny Moore (portrayed by Orlando Bloom) has an idea to create a competition where gamers can race real cars, with the winner earning a chance to compete professionally. Enter Jack Salter (portrayed by David Harbour), a tough but ultimately benevolent coach tasked with training and moulding our competitors into their best selves. Gran Turismo is loosely based on the true story of John Mardenborough (although the extent of creative liberties for the big screen remains uncertain). Regardless, it's a tale filled with highs and lows and a heartfelt core, notably brought to life by Archie Madekwe and Djimon Hounsou.The only aspect that felt superfluous in this narrative was the love interest. It's not due to poor acting but because it serves the same thematic purpose as the family. The family, especially the father, plays a more effective role in emotional character development, rendering the romantic subplot unnecessary-a mere checkbox.First and foremost, I'm not particularly a car enthusiast. Gran Turismo likely holds even greater appeal for aficionados of the automotive world. Nevertheless, Gran Turismo successfully incorporates elements directly from the game, which, in turn, were inspired by our real world. A racing-focused film must deliver intense racing sequences, not just passable shots. Gran Turismo accomplishes this through cinematic shots with quick cuts, shifting to third-person perspectives, attaching GoPro cameras to various cars, and more. Each of these techniques effectively captures the essence of the game and is commendable. I must highlight the subtle touches, such as incorporating specific sound bites (from the PS5 menus) in certain scenes or replicating the list of racers exactly as it appears in the game. These are minor yet praiseworthy details.Regarding video game adaptations, Gran Turismo stands as another commendable example of what happens when the source material is respected rather than creating an entirely new story within a familiar setting. It may not claim awards or widespread recognition, but it tells a substantial story in a modest yet impactful way.","

"Gran Turismo","MrDHWong","5 October 2023","""Gran Turismo"" is a sports drama film based on the series of racing video games for Sony PlayStation. Directed by Neill Blomkamp (""District 9"", ""Elysium"", Chappie"") and starring David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Archie Madekwe, it deviates from the usual video game film adaptation tropes to offer a fun, fast, feel-good story that always promises to entertain.After marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) convinces Nissan to establish the GT Academy, a competition intended to recruit proficient Gran Turismo players into real racing drivers, he sets out to find an appropriate coach for these potential candidates. Danny soon happens upon former driver Jack Salter (David Harbour), who is now working as a mechanic, and after some persuasion he reluctantly accepts the job to prepare the new trainees. Meanwhile, in Cardiff, Wales, teenager Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe), a dedicated Gran Turismo player who dreams of becoming a real racer, sets a time record on an in-game track, which qualifies him for a place in the GT Academy. Upon arriving at the Academy training camp, Jann and the rest of the contestants are pushed to their very limits by Jack's intense coaching methods, which are intended to separate the weak from the strong. Jann eventually comes out on top and is promptly chosen by both Jack and Danny to represent Nissan in a series of races around the world.For more than a quarter of a century, the Gran Turismo series has remained one of Sony's most popular video game franchises for their PlayStation consoles, with over 90 million units sold worldwide. The racing simulator has built upon its reputation for the attention-to-detail regarding its realistic graphics, accurate physics engines, and the player's general freedom to fine tune and customise their vehicles to unique specifications, effectively proving the game's slogan as ""The Real Driving Simulator"". From 2008 to 2016, Sony and Nissan collaborated on the GT Academy as a way to allow skilled Gran Turismo players to fulfil their dreams of becoming real professional racers. One of the most notable contestants was Jann Mardenborough, who at the age of only 19 was one of the youngest participants in the competition's history. Jann's story is told to us in the 2023 film titled simply ""Gran Turismo"", which is sure to please not only fans of the game, but also newcomers who can appreciate some high-octane scenes of racing.Though the film is based primarily around a video game, try not to let that deter you too much. In actuality, this is a classic underdog story about a young man who defied the odds to become a racing legend in his own right, with the video game basis being little more than a plot element. Like most people his age, Jann is shown to be dreaming of bigger things far beyond where he is now. He is stuck in an unfulfilling job as a clerk in a clothes shop where his desire to race cars for a living can only be fantasised through the video game Gran Turismo. When the opportunity finally presents itself to him, Jann works tirelessly to ensure he is up for the task, even if that means going against his father's wishes. It is here we see Jann work his way up the creative ladder, putting to use the skills he acquired through thousands of hours of gameplay exploring every racing possibility and outcome. However, Jann soon learns he is not the only one who possesses these qualities, as he has strong competition from other similar players who are also vying for the chance at becoming fully fledged racers as well. In any other case, it would be easy to dismiss this film as another generic rags-to-riches tale but since this is actually based on true events, there is a more satisfying sense of enjoyment to be had as we watch things play out for Jann in the best way possible.Since this is a film about car racing, it would be safe to assume that it would have its fair share of thrilling race scenes, and this one certainly delivers on that front. Director Neill Blomkamp's creative use of quick-cut editing allows no room for boredom as we see cars whoosh past each other and constantly place themselves in dangerous positions where even the smallest mistake could result in death. It is here that Blomkamp reminds not only the contestants but the audience themselves that this is not a game but real life where the consequences of poor decision-making cannot be mitigated by simply resetting the console. As a result, these racing parts are considerably more exciting than what you might expect from a typical ""fast car"" movie, as these are essentially just young gamers who lack most of the real-world experience that actual professional race car drivers have been using for longer than most of them have been alive. I found myself highly invested in these scenes because there was a lot more at stake if something went wrong with one of these drivers, and the film does a decent enough job of developing these characters as people you feel like cheering for when things turn rough.Perhaps as a reminder to us that the film is based on a video game, there are some parts which I assume are there as a means to simulate the mindset of what the players are thinking as they are racing. For instance, in one scene we see Jann driving around in his father's car, which he stole when he snuck out to a party with his friends and is later pulled over by the police. As the adrenaline kicks in, Jann decides to make a run for it and drives off with the cops in hot pursuit. During this chase, Jann imagines the world around him as how it would be viewed in the Gran Turismo heads-up display (HUD), with the speedometer on the bottom corner and map indicators pointing him in the right direction to avoid being caught. Upon losing the persistent police, Jann envisions winning in-game trophies and unlocking achievements like ""Cop Avoidance"" for all his trouble. Although moments like this are intended to be played for laughs, they mostly come across as weird and unnecessary, similar to the first-person view scenes from the 2005 film adaptation of ""Doom"". With that said, there are only a small handful of these types of scenes so it's not too much of an issue.In his first leading role, Archie Madekwe does a nice enough job in the role of Jann, whose everyman persona makes him a likeable character to support throughout the story. Though there isn't too much depth to him, we are given just the right amount of information and backstory to Jann as a person for us to want him to succeed. He is passionate about car racing, he cares about his family and friends, and he is determined to get as far as possible in this competition even if it takes a toll on his mental health. I'm not entirely sure how accurate Madekwe's portrayal is compared to the real Jann but by movie standards he appears to be your typical underdog hero, along the lines of Rocky Balboa or Daniel LaRusso. To that effect, he is a character you'd be happy to see achieve his goal.Both David Harbour and Orlando Bloom were also nice additions to the cast as Jack and Danny, respectively, each contributing something interesting to the story. Jack is the film's strict but fair trainer, pushing the GT Academy's contenders past their limits to become better versions of themselves. Without giving away spoilers, we learn more about Jack's back story regarding why he no longer races, which is quite a tragic revelation. On the other hand, Danny is a savvy businessman who understands the potential of tapping into a particular demographic, in this case, gamers. He is the brains behind this whole operation, and someone willing to risk his entire reputation on a group of young gamers who may or may not have what it takes to prove themselves to the world. It's worth noting that Jack and Danny are in fact composite characters and aren't actually based on one particular person, likely due to either legal reasons or the numerous amount of people that were involved in this entire program.Whether you're a fan of the games or not, ""Gran Turismo"" manages to deliver a solid, visually stimulating experience that helps elevate it above the source material from which it is based. At its core, it is essentially just another story about an underdog overcoming adversity, but I believe that's really all it needs to be in the end. Besides, it's not like the original games had much of a plot to begin with, so I suppose compromises like this seem necessary. After all, who doesn't like to see a good old fashioned tale of success over hardship every now and then? I know I do.I rate it 8/10.","

If you can manage to see through the cliches and think of the actors as real people (a lot of real people would feel this average) then this is a great movie. This is the very typical underdog over-performing and scoring the towards the top.I do not care how cliche this is, this is universal, this is the typical lost cause coming back and surviving and winning despite all the odds. That can never, ever, be old or run of the mill boring. This is why we watch movies, this is why we want to escape reality. This movie is the very definition of escapism fun. If you do not like this you are dead inside.Yea, this is not 100% nor the best artistic film ever, but whooooo freeekiiiing caaaaares?I give this a generous 9/10. It is probably not that good. A real movie critique would probably give it a 7/10, but I could not care less.

"Gran Turismo","Ameliex","4 October 2023","WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!I'm not a race car fan, nor do I have any idea what the sport is about. But watching this movie was INCREDIBLE. So entertaining!I love that this movie was based on a true story too!Such an exhilarating sports movie.You get so inspired watching this movie. It gives you the positive energy to reflect on your own life. It gives you a message of NEVER EVER GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS. Truly an inspirational movie.Shows you that whatever you set your mind to, you can do it! If you just believe in yourself!The scenes between Jann and his dad are emotional and will 100% make you cry. Such beautiful scenes.Even if the lead star in this movie is Archie Madekwe, you see that David Harbour shines bright too! Both of them played their roles amazingly.I had no idea who Archie Madekwe was before this movie and I hope to see him in more movies in the future.100% I recommend you watch this, even if you aren't into car racing and stuff like this.","

"Gran Turismo","georgegrimes","19 August 2023","Firstly I do not watch F1 motor racing or similar. Secondly I do not play computer games. However, I watched the trailer for 'Gran Turismo', and I was persuaded. From the outset, the film's narrative grips as the ordinary downbeat underdog is given an opportunity to satisfy his clear, single minded desire to become a star driver. The writing folds the elements succinctly into place as recognisable types of characters move throughout like pieces on a chessboard. Orlando Bloom is outstanding. David Harbour plays a traumatised individual well. Darren Barnett is excellent as a competitive upstart. Josha Stradowski was eminently dislikable as the nemesis. I did not warm to Archie Madekwe, but he was utterly convincing all the way through to the triumphant end. I knew nothing about car racing, but now I've been inspired to research more on this sport that previously would have me switch off.","

"Gran Turismo","passamazonassessments","14 January 2024","I was expecting a 6 from this movie but I was blown away by how this true story was brought to life on the screen. I only regret not watching this on the big screen!It's not only a great racing movie but the acting, visuals and story telling are really good. It makes any modern Fast and Furious movie look very bad in comparison.I actually thought that the actors are placements, I didn't think that the depictions of them are as close to accurate as can be.The racing is suspenseful and made me tense up with anticipation, especially during the Le Man's race, which I was not expecting at all. It was like I was watching the suspenseful end of Loki Season 1 but for more than 30 minutes, I'm not sure how long the race was, that's how great it was. Now I don't like watching racing but this would get me into it.I never heard of this before but thank you Gran Turismo, Nissan, Danny Moore, Jack Salter (especially for making the right decision) as well as all cast and crew. Worth watching from the beginning to end. I guess only snobs who can find something wrong in anything marked this below a 7.","

"Gran Turismo","bec-carter","6 August 2023","I played this game back in the early 00's so when I saw that this movie was being released I had a rush of nostalgia. That nostalgia is satiated by certain elements within the movie but it also doesn't rely on it.I took myself, my 18yo son and my 9yo nephew and all three of us left the cinema raving about it. Each of us bringing away something different yet each of us loving it for the same qualities. I will definitely be seeing it again in the cinema, my son is keen to play the game (which I'm sure is part of the marketing plan - and it worked) and my nephew states that it is easily in his ""top 10 favorite movies of all time"" which is actually quite impressive.It is definitely the kind of movie that has the ability to engage many different demographics.","

"Gran Turismo","iStej","18 January 2024","It's competently shot and the performances are passable. There is a script and the plot is easy enough to follow for anyone. Apparently that's enough to be considered a good movie in 2023.I don't think it's possible to write a more formulaic script than this. Beat for beat you get to see the hero rising, having a dark moment and finally triumphing. Throw in a watered down love interest and some mild antagonizing and that's a wrap.The character which we follow non stop throughout the entire film apparently has no personality. And whatever little he has, never evolves. He can best be described as stoic and that's very generous.For 2 hours we follow around this empty shell of a character as he goes through the motions of the most toothless and predictable script in recent memory.It's clear that this is targeted at a very young or simple minded audience that either hasn't come in contact with this stale film formula yet or is incapable of recognizing patterns.If you've watched more than a handful of movies in your life and can beat your dog at math, you should probably skip this one.","

"Gran Turismo","darkreignn","10 August 2023","I'll be honest - I didn't think I would enjoy ""Gran Turismo."" As someone who has never played the game, and as someone who isn't necessarily a fan of racing or of cars, I really thought I'd be bored out of my mind while watching this movie. I was wrong. With director Neill Blomkamp at the helm, ""Gran Turismo"" exudes a certain energy to it that is nothing less than infectious. With slick directing, fast-paced editing, and a booming, toe-tapping soundtrack, I found myself consistently entertained from beginning to end.""Gran Turismo"" is very reminiscent of ""Top Gun"" in as much as it's about a wanna-be elite athlete who undergoes extensive training to make his dream a reality, ultimately facing an ultimate test that pushes his skills to the absolute limit. And yes, even though this film is based on a true story, this is by no means the most original plot line out there at the moment. The thing is - at least for me, personally - underdog stories are always relentlessly entertaining; and in the case of ""Gran Turismo,"" the underdog story was filled with enough tension and intensity to keep me on the edge of my seat.Listen, you've seen this movie before.... but have you seen it conveyed with so much energy? Most likely not. Blomkamp directs this film in such a way that it never lets up - from the sheer charisma of the actors to the visceral thrills of the racing sequences, this is a movie that manages to hold attention, even if you're someone - such as myself - who has no interest in the subject matter. The movie moves at a breakneck pace, almost tailor-made to ensure viewers do not get bored; characters have fast-paced conversations and engage in fast-paced activities, and everything is wrapped around a directing and editing style that is also suitably fast-paced and boredom-resistant. The racing sequences, especially, are incredible to witness on the big screen and are 100% worth the price of admission (seriously, the crash scenes in and of themselves are a spectacle worth paying to see).Are there any negative qualities about this film? Well, of course. As seems to be the norm these days, there are many sequences of unrealistic and cringe-worthy dialogue - but, I mean, what else can you expect from a video game movie. Additionally, and I'm not one to frown upon a little love in my movies, but there are some scenes of romance that feel extremely forced and unrealistic. And finally, ""Gran Turismo"" is simply too long for its own good - by no means does this have to be an over two-hour long film; if this was 90 minutes, it would've been the most thrilling spectacle of the summer.All of that said, ""Gran Turismo"" is still a really fun time at the movies, and it's something that I'm considering going to see again due to the sheer entertainment value. I would highly recommend this movie, even if you're someone who doesn't care about cars or racing - as YouTube critic Jeremy Jahns said, this is a good time, no alcohol required (and take it from me - I didn't have a single sip of liquor, and I still managed to enjoy this film).","

"Gran Turismo","mumu420yhboi","12 August 2023","Whole film is very immersive
The game elements introduced in the film are amazing with the path lines on the track and the position of the car. Although the freeze frames for the position were overused and would suit better to have a smooth position indicator on top of the car during the race. The police chase at the start was a perfect display of game interpretation in real life.The acting was mediocre at the start but main cast overtook the show after David Harbour was introduced. The emotional scenes were great creating heartfelt moments.The cinematic of this film was beautifully shot, with drone shots during the races most impactful.The training montages could have been longer to emphasise on how hard it is to physically train to be in a real life race, the montages were short and uneventful.As well as this is based on a true story creates even more meaning behind the film, definitely recommend it!","

Great story, great cast, excellent soundtrack, usual Hollywood type Top Gun / Day of Thunder Story (like so many others), but what's not to like? This is what the cinema is build for, films like this all day long and why we must save the cinema forever. These are the type of films that sometimes go unnoticed because they don't have all the hype but I would not have been happy if I missed in the cinema.

"Gran Turismo","KFstudios2009","27 September 2023","Gran Turismo is a movie based on a true story. They brag so much about it, and I think that overall it was very interesting too watch it. It dragged me on, started a bit slow, but got absolutely amazing later, so my rating would be accurate to what I want to give. Car movies was never my type of movies, like Fast and Furious, or even the Disney Cars movies. But this one was very different, I got a lot of out it, and it was just so great. What made it great? First of all, the action. It was building up greatly, and when the car racing started, that was great. So many cool angles, repetitve, but I'm ok with that, I think it was cool too watch it anyway. Great, intense, camera-shoots of the wheels, characters, and racing track through the action sequence. The cars looked very good, and I'm amazed how many stunts this movie had. Planes, helicopters, racing cars, and much more! The racing tracks were greatly designed, great challenges for the drivers, and man! I got very entertained, long time ago I got so entertained by a sport movie. The acting was ok, average, Jann Mardenborough, preformed by Archie Madekwe, was the best one, he played the main character and played how he should be played, not much character development but in such movies it is not the most important. Orlando Bloom, that I had high expectations on, wasn't the strongest part, he was just kind of there, and didn't do much, so I can't say he was good, but I can't either say he was bad. Like I mentioned, the actors were average. If I have to tell somebody about a great car movie, I would recommend this one. Of course, it was high market pressure, Play Station and Nissan are big sponsors of this movie, so I get the idea that people would say this is more of a commercial, but I liked it. I think it was very entertaining, and very well done, and of course, you can do anything, if you want, and if you try. This movie can be a good movie for kids that want to do their dreams, and never give up.","

"Gran Turismo","shelbymustang","2 September 2023","""Based on the unbelievable, inspiring true story of a team of underdogs"".Well, they did use some of the real life character's names and made up the rest. With so many good to excellent racing movies out there to draw inspiration from they chose to make a CGI cartoon along with a fantasy storyline that morphs the actual real life events.Am I being too harsh? I don't think so, I will not go into the details but it didn't take long for me to ferret out the real story from credible online sources.Take the racing movies 'Grand Prix', 'Le Mans', 'Driven', 'Rush' and 'Ford v Ferrari' all of which were produced in the $90M to $97M in 2023 dollar budget numbers.'Gran Turismo' is what you get for $60M.As I said...a cartoon, check out the percentages of the CGI used throughout. That didn't take me long either.""I know this track. I've raced it a thousand times"". Yeah right...","

"Gran Turismo","invalid-03465","28 February 2024","Im a gear head, I love motorsports and I hated this movie.This is another classic underdog sports story movie, you know the type. Starring the total underdog with no support from anybody, the stereotypical trainer that was soo good but dropped out because of an incident and a sneeze ball manager, dirty fighting rivals and all that jazz. Totally blant.What makes these kind of movies interesting is their love for the sport. But this movie doesnt have any. Nor does it respect the sport, it feels more like a bad satire.The racing scenes are horrible, straight out of Fast and Furious. A Classic: MC is trailing a car, breathes in, SloMo, shifts down, pushes the pedal to the medal and cruises around the other car as if it was parking. Doesnt matter if in a corner or on a straight.Thats not how this works, thats not how any of this works!Or the movie brings up racing drivers going at it for a decade or longer. And these people intentionally crash into other people.Yeah no. Just no. Noone would let someone like that race. Or would be willing to race with them.The disrespect for the sport and its athletes, both for motorsports and sim racing, is unfuriating.So the script is trash and the racing is trash.But is it at least a well made movie?Also no.The editing is from Taken 3 with 30 cuts per second. The acting is meh but thats hard to tell with such boring and predictable figures.And if that all wasnt enough, this is a massive ad for Sony, Playstation, Gran Turismo and Nissan.At least the CGI was decent.","

"Gran Turismo","MovieWarfare","27 October 2023","Gran Turismo is the next PlayStation IP to be adapted to the big screen. Their first attempt with Uncharted wasn't good but The Last of Us TV series was great. I was already interested in the idea of this movie but was further interested because of the director, Neill Blomkamp. He has not made anything as good as his first movie, District 9. Has Neill managed to return to form or is this another forgettable entry from him?Firstly, David Harbour is terrific in this movie as Jack Salter. He plays the old tough mentor to the main character and he plays it so well. David just delivers those powerful speeches with such weariness and charm. Orlando Bloom is also great in this film as the marketing executive at Nissan. Orlando gives a charismatic yet slight sliminess to his performance that is so fitting for a person in marketing. Djimon Hounsou is wonderful in the role of the Dad. He is playing a Dad who is disappointed in his son for just playing video games. A character like that would be very disliked by the audience but Djimon manages to make him very loving despite that. Djimon delivers the most emotional performance in this whole film despite his minimal screen time. Archie Madekwe plays the main character, Jann Mardenborough, and he does a good job. His performance is tame compared to the others and he is outshined. Still, his performance makes him feel more relatable which is a perfect fit for a gamer character.It's a solid telling of an underdog story. It has all the tropes you would expect: an underdog given a 1 million chance to make it, a grouchy mentor who warms up to the main character, the early success, the big setback in the later parts etc. However, it tells the story well and with a lot of heart. The dramatic and emotional moments still hit hard. A big core of this movie is the father and son dynamic between Jack and Jann. Seeing the relationship between the characters grow and the moments where Jack pushes Jann are superb. This is thanks to the great chemistry between David and Archie. The race scenes are also magnificent thanks to the great direction of Neill. He uses video game overlays to help the audience keep track of what place Jann is in a race. He also cuts away to the engine or the front seat to put the audience in the seat of the car. The climactic race is incredibly engaging and Neill does a great job in delivering a great conclusion.However, due to the fact it is telling a story you have seen a dozen over, nothing in the plot surprises you. There isn't any moment of subversion or surprises, which could be a bit disappointing. There are some problems in the story though. There is a love interest and romance element in this movie with a character called Audrey, whom Jann is in love with. The romance is not fleshed out at all with no exploration of Audrey's character. She doesn't even do anything in the story that is meaningful whatsoever. She is just there for the main character to kiss someone. I am also disappointed by the lack of Jann's dad in this movie. It feels like there should have been more interactions between Jann and his dad as it would have made the final scene between them have more impact. The movie is 2 hours long but even that feels too much for what is a generic story. The final race is very noticeable CGI and kind of ugly at times too.Overall, Gran Turismo is a surprisingly solid film. The trailers and marketing didn't do a good job of selling this. It's not going to blow you away but it's very enjoyable. Neill's is a great director who has made too many misses. Hopefully, this is the beginning of his return.","

"Gran Turismo","Aziz24","9 August 2023","Synopsis: Jann Mardenborough is a gamer who enjoys playing Gran Turismo and with a passion for becoming a professional race driver one day. However, this simulator video game turns into reality.Going into this film knowing ZERO information about the very interesting and successful back story of Jann Mardenborough is one of the main reasons that might make anyone enjoy the story even more. A very interesting film that made me miss going to an IMAX theatre - the format that this film should be watched in - to watch a film about ""cars and racing"". However, the film is filled with mistakes and missing elements that simply make it a ""one-time watch"" type of film.Firstly, the star of this film is simply not Jann Mardenborough - who the WHOLE film is based on. It is actually Jack Salter who is played by David Harbour and that's simply because choosing Archie Madekee as Jan Mardenborough is simply not convincing to me. Unfortunately, the actor added nothing to the character nor made it special in any way.On the other hand, David Harbour returns in yet another role that is very similar to his role in the tv show Stranger Things (2016 - ?) and shares many elements with his character Jim Hopper in the show in terms of having that fatherhood and caring aspect in his character to take care of a young person. I guess it was a good thing and a bad thing in this film at the same time. Bad thing because he simply didn't present anything NEW. I felt like I was seeing the exact same relationship between Jim Hooper and Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) in this film that is between Jack Salter and Jann Mardenborough. Good thing because this is the ONLY good acting role and character in this whole film - thanks to David Harbour.The film touched very briefly and missed on a very major topic that should've been discovered and discussed more which is the relationship that Jann Mardenborough has with his family specifically with his father who is played by Djimon Hounsou. Despite having a very brief dramatic scene and limited screen time, he is mo than convincing, and the few brief scenes that he appeared in especially the one towards the end is very much convincing and touched the heart.Perhaps the film should've dedicated a little few sequences to Danny Moore's character and story about the different challenges and struggles he faced in terms of choosing a gamer to be the next best race driver from the video game simulator Gran Turismo, as turning this dream of gamers into reality is based on one of his marketing strategies to support Nissan which is shown in a very brief scene at the beginning of the film that is not enough. In addition, Orlando Bloom puts on a very great performance as Danny Moore which is a wasted card, unfortunately.Having Emelia Hartford as the love and romance aspect in this film can simply be described as a ""filler"". Very unnecessary and not needed.Perhaps the film's only card that could've truly benefited from is the cinematography which turned out to be a waste. The film relies heavily on the rule of thirds in the dialogue sequences which gets boring towards the end of the film for the ver use. Some of the shots should've been replaced with close-up shots, especially during tense sequences happening between two characters.However, the film mixes real-life racing and video games as the scene sometimes jumps between both at the same time to make it feel like a video game race in a real-life race. Very creative choice especially since the film revolves around that idea.Lastly, something that really surprised me that the film did not touch on is the backstory of how Jann Mardenborough truly fell in love with racing cars ad with the Gran Turismo video game, or how he gets his first video game console that made him get into this world. Perhaps a sequence that jumps back in the time when he was younger showing us that visually would've been better than just mentioning it briefly during a short scene.My rating is: 6.5/10

So good!My wife started out by telling the friends with us, ""Oh, a this is a boys movie"" as she saw the initial racing scenes.

Orlando Bloom comes across like this is a joke for him and has horrible acting and accent.I really enjoyed it for the story, but it did make a bit of a chore to get through with some of the Orlando story build up at the start as he is so bad. But as it becomes less about him and more about the two leads, the film gets better.Watch it if its on streaming, you will enjoy it as a whole, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it if I had to pay or had any positive pre expectations for it.","

"Gran Turismo","waltermwilliams","4 September 2023","Rev heads do yourself a favour and hunt down this movie whilst it's still on a Big Screen somewhere.I went into this movie with low expectations that it would be aimed at just gamers, but it's not!""Gran Turismo"" although based on the hugely popular Sony Playstation series of Games it is one of the best Motorsport movies in years.You will believe you can drive a race car at ridiculous speeds over convoluted tracks around the world.Based very loosely on a true story of the Gran Turismo Academy set up this century to tap into young racers.What they say: It's the inspirational story of a team of underdogs a struggling, working-class gamer, a failed former race car driver, and an idealistic motorsport exec - who risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world.They actually deliver on this promise and more!Even though it's a PG film there are adult concepts surrounding the competitive and deadly nature of the sport.If you want thrills, spills and an adrenaline rush see ""Gran Turismo"" starring a relative unknown Archie Madekwe in the lead role as ""Jann Mardenborough"".Fun Facts: The real Jann performs all the stunt driving for Archie...and Archie only passed his driving test weeks before shooting ""Gran Turismo"".Listen for: the surprisingly relaxing songs that put Jann at ease before a big race.""Gran Turismo"" is not a cast of Neville Nobodies.David Harbour (""Stranger Things"") is the the teams Chief Engineer and washed up driver with a back story.In one of the rare moments of his colourful career this giant bear of a man, Harbour, looks short next to his 6 foot 5 inch co-starOrlando Bloom is ""Danny Moore"" the man who invented the Academy for Sony.Archies parents are the very respectable Djimon Hounsou and there's even a former Spice Girl playing his wife Lesley.If South African Directer Neill Blomkamp could hire Geri Horner (formerly Halliwell) why not get the worlds most successful girl group back together for a reunion.Baby, Sporty and Posh could have all had guest appearances or cameos.That's one way to Spice to up your life and any movie.Who does Blomkamp think he is?He's no Wannabe though, because he gave us ""District 9"", ""Chappie"" and ""Elysium"".","

"Gran Turismo","zkswpjz","21 December 2023","There are youth oriented movies about rising from the rubble to chase your dreams that older viewers can connect with. This isn't one of them.The script is canned spam, spoon fed to a teenager game boy audience. The characters are one dimensional as is the acting. The racing action is ok but not enough to elevate this abysmal flick above more than stale popcorn served in a flashy wrapper. I turned it off at 55 minutes because to watch any further would have been an exercise in self flagellation. If you're under the age of 25, a gamer, and lack a discriminating pallet for a well made movie, then I'm sure you'll find it enjoyable. If, however, you actually like a solid script, good acting, and memorable stories, watch something else.","

"Gran Turismo","khalidmoubile","7 October 2023","Gran Turismo.Based on the unbelievable, inspiring true story of a team of underdogs - a struggling, working-class gamer, a failed former race car driver, and an idealistic motorsport exec - who risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world.I'm finally back to watching movies, through Gran Turismo that has to be one of thr best surprises of the year !Yes and for many reasons it is one of this year's best so far, the achievements in directing car races is the best I've ever seen besides it is kind of a video game movie adaptation and I don't think we love that type of films often.So, As I said directing was very powerful those taken shots from the back that feels like a gameplay were mind-blowing for me! I liked every race and the way they filmed them, I'm a big fan of that.I had some minor issues with the plot, somehow it felt unreal and I was shocked to know by the end that it is based on true story, but still the storytelling and dialogs were by far the weakest point in the movie.Finally, David Harbour was great and I wasn't expecting him to be that great honestly, his chemistry with Archie Madekwe was wonderful, and Archie did convince me that he's a introvert kind of gamer and he really fits the role but when it comes to his performance in emotional scenes, he couldn't deliver !","

I thoroughly enjoyed it and the story telling in it was very thoughtful. Now I won't give it a 10 because it's obviously predictable but that's why it's impressive. They made a predictable story something I was interested in watching. The subtle ebb and flows, the story of his mentor guiding him through the process, it was a moving piece. Honestly my fiancé was out of her seat pacing while the final race was occurring and genuinely excited for his victory. Overall just an entertaining and enjoyable movie. Definitely a need to watch movie for race car fans.","

I have failed miserably because I didn't give it my all, I didn't believe it was possible for me to achieve what I was dreaming of.This movie felt like it was about me and my own life.For the majority of my life I've been dreaming of achieving something that no one believed I was capable of doing. My parents never supported me, literally everyone told me that I was going to be a failure.Eventually I just gave in to them and started learning programming. Something that I'm not passionate about at all but pays really good money. I became a Software Developer since and I'm getting paid really well. But is that what matters? I don't know.This movie brought tears to my eyes at multiple instances. For me this was a one in a lifetime experience.The sound quality was insane and the stunning visuals were breathtaking.I watched it in IMAX and I strongly recommend that you do the same.","

I don't have the latest in the series but I regularly play GT Sport and also follow Super GT on YT, a gamer who has a bizarrely similar story to the main character from this cookie-cutter, predictable, uninteresting gear porn.They could have done so much more with this. I don't get why they chose to replay the same story we've seen before, with the same 'roll-your-eyes' clichés, all over again. Because it's safe? PlayStation is not in a position to be safe. And with the director they chose, they shouldn't have been. Now, everybody lost. We lost an interesting movie about a racing sim. A lot of people love. The director lost because he doesn't care about proving anything anymore. PS lost because they don't take risks.I really wanted to like it more.","

Among the best Motorsports movies that I've seen. Obviously there's a ton of brand placement, but that doesn't take away from the experience.My only real criticism of the movie is the lack of Gran Turismo music in it from artists like Daiki Kasho and also other famous GT music. The drama element in the movie was really well done, you can actually feel the emotions of the protagonist as well as the engineer. The way the races were shot was realistic and also the last 20 minutes was some of the best moments in motorsport film.Especially if you grew up with Gran Turismo, just watch it.","

But that was obviously not a goal anywhere on the priority list. Who is the target audience for this movie? Because motorsport racing fans, or Gran Turismo fans, are probably highly disappointed because of all the comical inaccurate depictions of races, physics, etc. The industry professionals that participated should also be disappointed they were apart of something that so badly represents the culture. Need For Speed, known for unrealistic game play, at least made a realistic movie.","

I loved the game but this had no actual attempt to develop the characters or anything ya know what a good movie needs. I can see kids loving it , the graphics are awesome but just no story to it.i was a huge fan of the games when you could play them and not get charged for everything..

"Gran Turismo","RegalsReelView","15 August 2023","Jann Mardenborough has always dreamt of being a race car driver. The closest he ever got to a race car was in his simulation setup while playing Gran Turismo. Being one of the best players of the game, Jann was invited to compete for a spot in an academy that would train gamers into race car drivers. What seemed like an unlikely dream turned into reality, and Jann overcame the odds to become a member of Team Nissan.Based on actual events, and shows that if you try hard enough, even the most unlikely of dreams are possible. The film shares the history of the game's development, how the marketing plan was executed, and the journey of Jann from simulation driver to race car driver. The race scenes are executed with perfection. Fans of the game, race cars, and anyone interested in a story about a young person beating the odds to achieve a dream will enjoy this movie.","

My only reason to not rate it as a perfect movie, is because I wish the cast had resembled the actual people (at LEAST closer), other than that I have NO complaints. HIGH ENERGY! If you love racing, this movie is for you! The sound of the engines is amazing throughout the entire movie. It definitely feels long, but I didn't want the movie to end. I feel most great movies are longer than the average. Ending on such a high note leaving you feeling like you're in the celebration!

"Gran Turismo","thechair","19 August 2023","Like a lot of people on here I had low expectations for this one, and perhaps that plays a fair part in how I feel about it but I absolutely loved it. If you've seen Days of Thunder then you've basically seen this as many of the beats are the same. That's no bad thing though! It isn't as glamorously shot as that Cruisemobile but it does bring a lot more heart with it, with a genuine underdog aspect ably played by newcomer Archie Madekwe, his rookie awkwardness on screen adding to the based-on-a-true-story feeling. David Harbour was excellent as his gruff engineer foil also.All of the above I was kind of expecting but what surprised me was how good the racing scenes were. I was completely wrapped up in each event, the editing and the sound design really ramping up the cinema experience - and I would definitely recommend that is where this is watched. I'll happily buy a 4K version when it comes out but this was designed for a big screen with blockbuster sound. I should caveat all of the above with the fact that I am very much an auto-sport fan, but I'm also pretty discerning about my movies. This one has made it to the podium (at least for the summer 'race'). Vroom Vroom.","

"Gran Turismo","twospies-67255","31 December 2023","If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. It's cut like a video game, super choppy and fast. Filmed like a bunch of commercials cut together. The first half is definitely one of the worst first halves of a movie I've ever seen. Cardboard characters. The actors are all phoning it in. So boring and predictable. Everyone seems super tired and weary to be in the movie. The plot is paint-by-numbers. Surprising, because I love all of the director's other movies.However, the 2nd half does get better. Better editing, more emotion and better character development.All that said, I'm 48 so if you're younger it's possible you have the short attention span most of the movie is tailored for. My kids ages 8 and 10 loved it.","

But this movie has made the impossible, it has killed the not existing interest in me for both of those things. How can anything kill two things that not exist, you may ask. Well, this statement doesn't make sense, right? Just as this movie.The script sucks, the acting is laughable, the SGI sucks, the dialogue sucks, the music sucks, the editing sucks, the cinematography is okay but I don't see anything, because the cutting is too fast. Oh, and did I mention ? The message of this movie is: ""If you don't have a PlayStation, (I mean you have to have one, because the average viewer of this movie clearly has one), buy Gran Turismo, lock yourself in the room, and be a car racer with watching a screen, because dreams can become true, only of course, if you buy them.""","

"Gran Turismo","The_Second_Opinion","9 August 2023","I came into the movie without having played any of the Gran Turismo games, never having watched any car race, never having even driven a car. So, I'm perhaps not really the target audience.Or am I? Leaving the theatre, I couldn't help but feel I had just witnessed a 2 hours and some minutes long advertisement. For what, exactly, I'm not sure. Is it a Gran Turismo ad? That's what the movie makes you believe for the first 45 minutes, when the plot focuses on the main character's difficulties on making the transition from the bedroom to the circuit. However, passed the first hour the movie takes a turn (pun intended) towards the pro side of the car racing sport.So I thought it would be an F1 ad after all. There's a lot of race footage, slow motions and the like, and that's where most of the production money must have gone. But if that's the case then it does a terrible job, as I left the theatre more confused than ever about the car race sport, how it's played, why people find it interesting, what are the tactics, and how something so stupidly dangerous can even be allowed. (2 critical accidents are displayed on screen, but in both cases everyone seems to find it normal for drivers and spectators to risk their lives for a car race and no one ever discusses talking action to prevent accidents from happening again.)In the end, the movie isn't really about anything, not even about the hero's journey. There's an absurd lack of focus on Jann (main character)'s struggles in adapting to high-intensity training, we just see him training a bit in the gym, we see other people struggling, but not him because... plot. Later in the movie he drinks alcohol several times and goes to a club. So much for all the F1 fans trying to convince us that it's really a high intensity sport which requires lifestyle sacrifices.Jann's relationship with his entourage is equally confusing. At first his family doesn't support him and the coach doesn't see his potential. The girl he likes just happens to like him back as well, he doesn't even need to pursue her, but she believes in him and tries to offer him support. Finally the coach comes to realise his potential and tells him his story so he can overcome it and do better than him. The coach owns an old music player with only 8 songs but doesn't want to upgrade because of nostalgia, so Jann buys him a new iPod and tells him it's a lesson.This could have been the movie's message right here: that it's important to leave the past behind in order to form a new future. It's a simplistic and overused theme, but it's still better than no theme. Just as Jann would break ties with his biological family and get closer to his girlfriend, echoing Jann's dad mistake of remaining in the past by favourising his other son, the one who plays football like he did. Without giving away any spoilers, the film doesn't end up going that way; and when the credits roll, it's actually the coach's name on top of the list, a giveaway that, in the end, it was him, the main character of the story.","

"Gran Turismo","misskermit99","3 August 2023","I wish the movie was a tad longer to flesh out some scenes; hence my rating. As someone who grew up playing racers on PlayStation with my Mom and Siblings, this was like a blast to the past. I got to watch early due to AMC's Investor Connect showing. The atmosphere in the theater was great with everyone laughing and cheering together at the right moments.I love how they handled the love story; which was the only thing I was kind of worried about. With that I wish they would have spent some more time in Tokyo as the visuals were great. Speaking of visuals, man, seeing the car animations in the trailer didn't do it justice for the big screen. There weren't too many of them, and when on screen they were done so well.I did watch some interviews and behind the scenes videos before watching so I had some idea of the backstory on which the movie is based on. I'm not sure if the movie does a good job of introducing the story in a way that's easy to follow for those who aren't aware, as I missed the beginning due to outside forces (not included in my rating). So I will need to go back to watch it again, which I'm more than happy to.All in all; if you love racer games/sims, or even want to watch a great story on the big screen, I'd recommend this movie!","

I also saw The Hill the same day and ironically they have very similar themes. Young men pursuing their dreams and overcoming ridiculous odds without the support of their fathers. One I loved for it's heart (The Hill) and one I loved for the action (Gran Turismo). But this one is made for the big screen for sure.

A crazy, unbelievable and inspiration true story of a gamer turned racer that wins you over with its charm, emotion and performances.A lot better than I expected, it's a great time at the movies!

Was I completely wrong! Gran Turismo has a lot of heart with a lot of exhilarating racing scenes. What I like about the film is you can be a fan of the game or have never played it to enjoy this movie. The movie is also based off of a real life true story which I was unaware of prior to watching. The movie centers around a young guy who gets an opportunity to race professionally based off of how well he did in a video game. Yes, you read that rigth and it's all true. The movie also has a lot of heart and emotion to it which I was not expecting. If you love cars and racing movies you will enjoy this one. Right now Sony PlayStation Studios is on a roll with their video game adaptions. I wish this movie could have been a little shorter at 2 hours instead of being 2 hours plus. Gran Turismo gets 7 solid stars out of 10 from me.","

"Gran Turismo","Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","20 September 2023","Hey, Streamers! Videogames seem to be a hot commodity in the entertainment industry these days. However, they aren't always adapted into good movies or television shows. This year alone we've seen what HBO could do with The Last of Us and Illumination produced The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Here Gran Turismo focuses on a real-life story related to the game. Let's see whether this angle yields an entertaining movie.Apparently, Gran Turismo is based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe). Jann is such an avid player of the racing simulator ""Gran Turismo"" that he believes he can become a professional racer. Jann has uncanny skill and ability to be successful and fast in the simulator, but it is questionable whether those skills translate to the real world. Meanwhile, Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), a marketing executive at Nissan, comes up with a scheme to boost Nissan sales by creating a GT Academy aimed at players like Jann getting the opportunity to become professional racers. Moore enlists a former professional racer, Jack Salter (David Harbour), to train the new recruits and turn those that attend the GT Academy into legitimate racers. Fast cars and racing hijinks ensue.Gran Turismo is a fun sports movie that comes with many of the sports movie tropes. There is an underdog in Jann. There is the grizzled, washed-up coach in Salter. There are worried and dubious parents and evil villains that lurk on the racetrack. The mix of these elements make for an enjoyable experience. Since this movie is based on true events, we know from the outset how this underdog story will turn out, but nevertheless it is still pretty thrilling. The racing sequences are shot really well, which makes the big screen experience feel vital. There are zooming cameras, and there are high-flying drone shots that help the audience follow the action on the track. The movie is edited really well too. It feels like a lot happens in a short amount of time which allows the movie to hold your attention.On the performance side, David Harbour is a standout as usual. He plays that curmudgeonly figure really well, but he has a sensitive side that makes him endearing like his Stranger Things alter ego, Jim Hopper. Ultimately, Harbour is able to convey how much his character cares for Jann despite his initial skepticism. I'll also shout out Djimon Hounsou, who plays Jann's father, Steve. Hounsou's part isn't big, but it is pivotal in the emotional side of the story. He has a couple really great scenes that maybe are a little cliched, but they worked for me.Side note: Ginger Spice plays Jann's mom, but there are no Spice Girls songs?Ultimately, Gran Turismo delivers a great and entertaining sports movie. It is a crowd-pleaser and a triumphant, unlikely story. There are cool camera shots and the editing keeps the movie moving at a fast pace like the cars these guys are driving. Also, there are some touching emotional moments. Grab a box of popcorn and go for a spin with Gran Turismo.","

"Gran Turismo","hypestyle","6 September 2023","Gran Turismo is a motion picture about the coming together of three very different men. Millions of dollars are at stake and it all hinges on how well one of them plays a video game. Well, there's more to it than that but it's a good summary of what the pitch must have been.In essence, the plot concerns the real life Jann Mardenborough, a Black biracial young man in England. His skill at the PlayStation car racing video games brings him to the attention of a Sony Entertainment marketing executive who has convinced Nissan Automobiles to sponsor a Gran Turismo tournament-the winner gets to join a cohort of elite gamers in training to be real-life professional car drivers. This time, it's more than just neighborhood bragging rights at stake. It's the chance of a lifetime.This writer has no idea about the real Mr. Mardenborough or the rest of the principals in this film. So when it comes to the presented narrative, how much fidelity, if any, it has to the real backstory of this man is unknown. But as a general entertainment story, this is enjoyable. Because of this film's video game connections, possibly some non-gaming viewers will be taken out of the story with the recurring visual nods (starting with a police chase highlighted by ""you dodged 'em!"" graphics). That said, the more obvious computer-graphics are kept to a minimum, so viewers won't feel like they're watching a Twitch exhibition. (And for those who don't know what Twitch is, ah... carry on). Lead actor Archie Madekwe as gaming savant Jann is believable in his role as a college-aged console enthusiast, gifted but sullen. The rest of his supporting cast do a solid job, though their roles are pretty much thankless. Geri Halliwell, former Spice Girl, is unrecognizable here as Jann's unglamorous housewife mom. The estimable Djimon Honsou plays Jann's father, an ex-soccer pro-turned-railyard laborer. He has much less involvement in the plot than viewers may expect (he shows up to scold, to admonish, and eventually, to support), but he seemed to make the most of the scenes where he has a presence. David Harbour as Jann's coach seems to hit the expected notes as a grizzled, middle-aged former racing veteran with a tragedy in his past. Orlando Bloom is a welcome presence. His corporate hustler character is not villainous but not heroic, either: his ethical dubiousness comes to a zenith when he almost derails Jann's rise in favor of a more telegenic (and, yeah, Caucasian) candidate. Other supporting characters are seen in brief sketches, including the lady-friend and the villainous 'racing bro' on a rival team. The cinematography is excellent, it captures a lot of engaging real-life race-car action. For casual action movie fans and those looking for a general feel-good drama, this movie is well worth checking out.","

"Gran Turismo","user-130-302188","13 August 2023","I must say that I am shocked when this film even managed to get above 6 for rating. The pacing is slow and story structure is very generic. The racing scenes should be the highlights of the film, but the way director shot them make them look like promotional ads of cars that are shown before the film. However, I must give kudos to David Harbour, who plays a frustrated mech engineer that doesn't believe players can be real racers at the beginning but later change his minds after building a bond with the protagonist. Harbour's performance feels emotional and sincere compared to other actors who are just there for cheques. Anyway, go see this film if you are bored or something, but don't hold high expectations for it.","

"Gran Turismo","michvanbeek","11 August 2023","It has been quite a while since we were able to see a film by South African director Neill Blompkamp in the cinema. In 2015 that was the disappointing Chappie and since then Blomkamp has been linked to various projects, he came up with some shorts, but otherwise it remained silent. Now there is a project that you would not really expect from Blomkamp, who is really more fixated on the science fiction and horror genre. The story of Gran Turismo is inspired by the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo player turned professional racing driver. The cast is quite striking with David Harbour, who is of course known from Stranger Things as Jim Hopper, Orlando Bloom from Lord of the RIngs and Pirates of the Caribbean and Djimon Hounsou from Guardians of the Galaxy and Blood Diamond, for example. But ex Spice Girl Geri Horner, or how we know her as Geri Halliwell, we also see a role in the film. The relatively unknown actor Archie Madekwe, who played roles in Midsommar and Beau is Afraid, plays the role of Jann Mardenborough. It should therefore not be the fault of the cast and director and we look forward to the film with great curiosity.The film did not disappoint, because one always has to take into account that things are exaggerated or dramatized. The film opens quite slowly and you can question the ease with which Jann is put in the GT car. Basically, Jann narrowly wins at the GT Academy, and is immediately allowed to race with the pros untrained. Finishing a race in fourth place and you immediately get your professional license. It must have all gone that way, but it just felt rushed and easy. Of course Jann is not doing well, because he is pushed off the track several times and ends up in a nasty crash, something that, according to the real Jann Mardenborough, has been processed in detail in the film. This scene looks intense and Blomkamp has beautifully incorporated it into the film. But the switches between races, training sessions and Jann's private life and especially the relationship between Jann and his father snow under a bit. In the end, his father turns out to be very important to Jann, but this just doesn't come out well and could have been exposed a bit better.The last roughly 40 minutes are allocated to the 24 hours of LeMans. This is also the best part of the film, where perhaps the first half of Gran Turismo is quite hard. It's not that you're bored or anything, but maybe it could all have been a bit more compact. In addition, the film is a continuous Sony and Playstation commercial, something that eventually starts to irritate. Anyway, the LeMans race is very, very well done. At the beginning a car shoots out of the corner and explodes, this graphically could have been a bit better, especially considering the rest of the film. After that, switching from day to night and back to day is natural and this is well done. Still, the tension only really builds in the last minutes of the race. Because will Jann make it to the finish? Of course Jann eventually decides to drive his own course and the inexperienced racer does his own thing against Nissan's wishes. It will probably really be a bit of tension building and to end the movie as spectacularly as possible.Gran Turismo has become an entertaining film that perhaps could have been worked out a bit better here and there. The races look slick, but it is mainly the pieces from Jann Mardenborough's private life that are reviewed very quickly. It is precisely the extremely uninteresting passages from Jann's life that are shown too slowly. Also, the inexperience is handled a little too easily. It seems as if Jann is put in a GT car from behind his Playstation and the job is done for a while. Max Verstappen can pack if it all goes so easily, of course. On the other hand, I really have no experience or understanding of cars or car races, so you can tell me anything about that. Anyway, Gran Turismo has become a great film, which will not really bore you for the rest.","

"Gran Turismo","ykjdh","28 August 2023","Let me just say I had no intention of watching this movie. It was advertised as a two hour commercial for the video game it got its name from. However, it's based on a true story which is where advertisers went wrong. They should have focused on that aspect of the movie and not video game graphics. The story line is actually pretty good and effective as correlating positive emotions from past movies like the original Rocky where you're cheering for the underdog. That's what this is, an actual underdog story and not a commercial for PlayStation.The character Jann is real and this is his story with characters actually resembling his family in real life. He's also his characters stunt double in the racing scenes. I found myself rooting for this guy who's from a working class family trying to make a dream come true. Former spice girl Geri Halliwell and Dimon Houston are his parents who come around to support their son. Ignore the video game tie in like I did and you'll discover a very effective story that will have you cheering.","

I wasn't sure about a movie about that game. To my surprise, it was about a lot more than just that. The story is very compelling. And the fact that is based on a true story, made it mor so. The acting was very good. David Harbour was awesome. The fact that the real life Jann was the stunt double for the actor playing him was also very cool. The visuals are also very well done. Movies involving a video game can be hit or miss. I would definitely put this movie on the hit column.","

First half is going to be make or break for some people with the faux gaming lingo and themes but it's absolutely worth sticking out because it's a seriously good bit of watching.Has its cliché characters etc but it works in the same way that Top Gun works in that there are so many good elements that you're not remotely bothered by some of the weaker punchlines.Hoping this pulls a sequel out in a few years and they can maybe pile some more budget towards the action racing scenes. I get it's based off of a game but having some proper practical effects and some real racing would bump this up to a 9 or 10 easily.","

"Gran Turismo","bogdanradu-74734","4 January 2024","As a motorsport film it fails terribly.Studios that make movies about racing it should prioritize racing fans and put work into making the scenes make sense. RACING fans should not have to ignore the blatant inaccuracies in the RACING scenes of a RACING movie in order to enjoy it.The physics of the cgi cars (which are used a lot) make no sense. They handle nothing like real cars, the crashes are all over the place, the main character can press the throttle harder than the other drivers and drive nonsensical racing lines but still gain time. There are countless other examples of motorsport inaccuracies in this movie's action and dialogue.This kind of unrealistic representation of racing for dramatic effect works in dumb explosion movies like Fast and Furious and kid's movies like Cars, but I feel that it is immensely distracting from this movie that is supposed to tell an amazing story that actually happened. The producers of the movie either didnt consult people that drive and have experience with LMP and GT cars or just ignored their input and rushed the movie.Some people said that the CGI scenes are supposed to be a combination between the Gran Turismo game and real life. This is not a good excuse for the unrealistic cars and phisics since the movie portrays GT as the most realistic driving simulator ever. The CGI racing scenes would have even been more realistic if they would have been filmed in the actual Gran Turismo game.Movies can both tell a great story and have realistic racing action that does not deter from it (e.g. Ford v Ferrari, Rush, The World's Fastest Indian).If you are not a racing fan/driver and you can look past the very bad dialogue and the, at times, bad cinematography than this film can be enjoyable for you.However if you become passionate about racing after seeing this film or if you were already a motorsport enthusiast you should be able to see the huge flaws and inaccuracies within this movie.","

"Gran Turismo","Mr-Topshotta","9 September 2023","Directed by Neil Blomkamp. A runtime of two hours and fourteen minutes. With a PG-13 rating. Based on a true story.

Ever since his dad ""Steve"" played Djimon Hounsou took him to see race cars at the age of five he had that itch.""Steve"" was a realist though. He never truly thought his son had a real opportunity for that life. If he had it his way ""Jann"" would follow in his footsteps as well as his younger brother ""Coby"" played by Daniel Puig playing soccer.""Jann's"" mom ""Leslie"" played by Geri Horner was usually the more supportive parent.Since ""Jann"" couldn't race he did the next best thing. He played the racing simulator game ""Gran Turismo"". Logging in thousands of hours throughout the years. Until ""Danny Moore"" played by Orlando Bloom with blessings from Nissan and the creator of ""Gran Turismo"", ""Kazunori Yamauchi"" played by Takehiro Hira.""Danny"" came up with the idea to have a tournament turning a top-tier gamer in ""Gran Turismo"" into an actual top-tier race car driver. Getting a former race car driver to be his pit crew chief in ""Jack Salter"" played by David Harbour. You watch the amazing true story of a gamer turning into the actual thing he's been playing all along.""Gran Turismo"" was not only a Phenomenal video game film but a phenomenal film. The way it was shot was amazing. The cinematography to the way they would go from a virtual scene to a real one. The way the engines hummed. If you're into racing or cars this will scratch that itch for you. They flawlessly transferred a video game to the big screen.I'm still mad at Archie Madekwe. I'm not over how his character was in season two of the AppleTV+ series ""See"". I've been seeing Archie in more things lately. His career is starting to take off. I loved the innocence he brought to this real character. I was even getting upset at the relationship he had with ""Audrey"" played by Maeve Courtier-Lilley. I'm like if you don't kiss the girl and stop playing games. Archie had me invested in the film even the parts he frustrated me with.I loved that the real ""Jann"" played as a stunt driver in his film. This film touched home for me in so many ways. Not only is ""Gran Turismo"" near and dear to my heart. My brothers and I spent many hours playing this game. Also, both my brothers are biracial and from Great Britain. So this film had an eerie connection to me. As I watched I just kept saying to myself this could be my brothers.What an amazing journey and they say what can video games do for you in the real world? Well, this is just one example of what video games can do for you. A lot. An excellent film, that gives you a mixture of young and seasoned actors.I had no clue this was all based on a true story. I have so much respect for everyone involved, especially Jann. I give this film five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

"Gran Turismo","Entertainmentsparadise","29 August 2023","Gran Turismo proves to be surprisingly captivating, offering crucial moments that meticulously delve into the world of professional car racing. While incorporating subtle nods to PlayStation and video games, the movie follows a straightforward narrative. The focal point remains on Jahn, a Gran Turismo simulation gaming prodigy, who aspires to transition from gaming stardom to becoming a professional racer. The storyline takes us through his journey, touching upon trials, tribulations, and moments of doubt, all culminating in a harrowing accident that gripped the entire theater audience.Although these moments could have been more intense, they manage to do justice to the story, leaving room for interpretation based on individual perspectives, whether at the beginning or end of the movie. Personally, I found myself engrossed from start to finish. The plot is intriguing and the actors performance, straddling the line between simulation and reality, is impeccably executed-a quality I especially appreciated as both a gamer and a movie enthusiast.Considering all factors, I firmly bestow upon Gran Turismo a solid rating of 3.5 out of five stars. It's definitely worth a watch, and the experience becomes even more immersive if you're seated in the dbox, allowing you to feel every bump and bruise as if you were part of the action. Gran Turismo successfully highlights the perilous nature of NASCAR racing, offering a global nod to gamers everywhere.","

I'm not even a fan of any racing game (other than MarioKart on the original Wii - there is no other for me) however the movie was able to take this true life story and deliver an occasionally touching and rousing movie. Add in a solid cast GT manages to rise above the typical package tropes of this type of a movie and deliver a well paced enjoyable underdog sporting/gaming film for both types of fan.","

Quite over the top sometimes and also very ficcional. It's based very loosely on a true story and it doesn't show any shame in twisting the truth for dramatic effects. It works here. My only problem was, being based on a game that made it's sucess looking to be the most accurate with cars and tracks, they just didn't care with some of them... being Le Mans almost ridiculous.","

"Gran Turismo","danchilton-71955","5 October 2023","It's tough times at the box office these days but if there's one film this year that doesn't need to worry about ticket sales surely it's Gran Turismo. In addition to being a feature long advert for the game it's named after there is so much product placement packed into the production that it must have been in the black before a single person saw the finished movie. Even after paying Orlando Bloom for the world's most expensive Ross Kemp impression. Bizarrely, due to the racing setting and overall kitsch factor, the excessive marketing doesn't derail the film.The basis of Gran Turismo is that back in 2008 Sony and Nissan got together to offer players of the Gran Turismo videogame the opportunity to train as real life racing drivers. This is based, albeit with a massive slice of creative licence, on one of the successful contestants.What follows is the most by the numbers sport story you could imagine. Plucky kid with big dreams tested in all the ways you expect. A stern father who wants what's best for his son but doesn't understand his dreams. Gruff mentor with a past who is won over by the lead characters determination. Snide rivals who underestimate the hero. Generic love interest who has no real part in the plot. It's all here interspersed with Sony Walkmans, copious billboards and of course plenty of talk about how realistic the game is. ""I've played it, it's.... Extraordinary"" whispers Bloom in awe when selling the racer idea. More or less the entire first 15 minutes or so are variations on this sentence.Despite it's limitations though Gran Turismo is pretty fun. The cast are solid with Archie Madekwe making protagonist Jann likable enough to root for and David Harbour unsurprisingly nailing the grouchy coach role. There is one strange casting choice with former Spice Girl (and perhaps more pertinently wife of F1 team boss Christian Horner) Geri Halliwell appearing as Jann's mum. She is fine but there's no getting around the fact its distracting having Ginger Spice at the dinner table.The real star of the show is the racing. These scenes look and sound great, giving a real sense of thrill and danger even if the outcome is always pretty predictable. This may be a far cry from his District 9 glory days but director Neil Blomkamp clearly still knows what he's doing behind the camera.You're not going to spend much time thinking about Gran Turismo once the chequered flag is waved but if you don't mind a large helping of cheese then there's worse ways to spend your time than checking it out.6 pre orders out of 10 videogames.","

It was nice to see a story without dark humor, violence, politics. I enjoy those elements, but was pleasantly surprised to not get any of those vibes from this movie. The racing scenes were awesome, they did a great job getting the audience really immersed into a race. Truly demonstrated the talent and power involved with these races. The acting was well done, by that I mean there was never a moment where I felt like someone was acting, I never had to look at my watch or realize I was watching a movie. That alone is a win. This movie was able to take the audience out of their reality for a couple hours. Highly recommend viewing this in the theater. I wish I would have seen it in IMAX. Go check this one out. It's a nice feel good story with some crazy challenges and didn't give anyone too much of an impression that anyone can go from couch to professional athlete.","

"Gran Turismo","simbiat","1 January 2024","It's one of those movies, that you can't hate, but you can't like, too.There is nothing particularly wrong with the movie. It looks good, the story overall is ok, too. But it feels kind of... Empty? Pointless? I did not feel much of a challenge in Jann reaching his dream, even though, I'm pretty sure, it was not that easy. Since there is no challenge, and since we already know how things will end (thanks to marketing) - there is absolutely no tension, there are no real stakes, there is no... Excitement. Which is core of racing, is it not?I remember people complaining that anime ""Overtake!"" lacked excitement in its racing, which was a valid criticism, but, at the least, it had something besides that: character development. It was not perfect, but it was there. Gran Turismo lacks even that. Or at least, I have not noticed any development. Besides, maybe, Jack Salter starting to believe that gamer can become a racer, after all.The original story is something that can inspire. That's what all the marketing was talking about: ""achieve your dream"". But achieving a dream is not easy. There are struggles involved there. Yes, they probably will not be as intense as being in literal war, but they will be there. A movie - is a great opportunity to dramatize those struggles, to make you feel the tension of going against the flow.This movie fails at that. Unless you think integrating elements from a game user interface equates to dramatization. I will forget this movie by tomorrow.","

There are some fun directing techniques that add to the racing scenes and video game roots. But so much of the writing and direction feels overly Hollywood, corny and cliche. None of the characters ever really feel fleshed out so massive events have very little weight to them.As a racing fan and someone who does track days, I found that the ridiculous exaggeration of racing and the horrible inaccuracies completely took me out of the film and made it feel comical rather than authentic. Coupled with the use of contemporary technologies and content, it was very distracting from what was a true story (kind of).Overall it's entertaining especially for the average audience. But if you're a Blomkamp or racing fan, prepare to be disappointed.","

The first half of this movie was very boring, dull, and was like every other racing movie out there. The second half dove more into the other characters in the film rather than just Jann, which I found to be slightly interesting. One thing I did like was the father's development throughout the movie. I personally found the soundtrack to be very lackluster rather than the very surprising appearance by Joji. Kenny G also made a few appearances in the soundtrack as well. Overall it wasn't the worst movie out there but I would defenitly take my chances with other movies such as Barbie and insidious 5.","

The soundtrack enhances with great engine noises and music tracks. The hero is likeable and not too heroic looking ( though at one point he did sound remarkably like Clive Owen?).

"Gran Turismo","KatieDuncan44","26 August 2023","It's based on a true story. They did a lot of things to the film to make it more simple for viewers to understand though. For example, they were actually many coaches but they consolidated it down to one coach for this film. It was actually the third time they had this competition, but for this film they made it seem like it was the first time they had this competition. Just things to make it more sensational and simple for the viewers. But I would rather that they made it more realistic and just kept it true to form. Because, in a way this movie was a little bit too simple and it needed more variance and spice and Dynamics. I'm not that into sports. And I'm not into racing either. So maybe this show would be more interesting to me as well if I was more interested in car racing and sports. I kind of wish I saw more behind the scenes of what the investors thought as well, like the company Nissan and PlayStation and the Japanese creators that would have been interesting. I'm into business drama! And maybe the perspective of the fans would have been interesting as well. That wasn't really included much in this movie. Just hum drum citizens. Somehow it was too one dimensional? We saw the main character and his two coaches mostly. We saw a slight tiny scenes with family and other competitors. I don't know it was a long film already so I guess they couldn't do too much more but I don't know I needed more dynamics of different angles of the plot going on. And somehow it lacked a certain ark that it needed. Like I didn't have the correct build up and drop that the show needed to have more bang. It almost had wow power in the emotional aspect but somehow it didn't quite hit it. I guess the acting was good. I'm not the best judge of acting though. It was nice to see cars I guess. And to appreciate technology behind games and cars. Which normally I don't care but maybe next time I buy a car I will be spicier and technologically cool and fancy and yada.","

The acting is fine: David Harbour is good (despite his character being rather unlikeable at times) but Archie Madekwe is a bit wooden and lacks the charisma to really make you invest in his journey.There are some corny scenes that involve almost panto like villains, but the movie overall is worth watching.Decent without being outstanding.","

"Gran Turismo","dbgeorge","20 November 2023","The fact I could not finish the movie does not mean the movie is bad. I watched primarily to see Emilia Hartford, but her role is minor in the half of the movie I did watch. I was excited to see David Harbour from Stranger Things in the movie, and his role is great. Some of the special effects are cool. I just thought everything was mediocre and I eventually got bored. Not a lot of character development. A lot of cliché dialogue and situations. Nothing was bad. I will probably go back and finish the movie one day. Maybe the third act will justify watching the film. I was hoping for more excitement.","

First off I did not know about the game (not a gamer) and I was so shocked this was based on a true story (some people have truly lived #sigh) But anyway the story was good and I love the way they potrayed everything about racing they did not hide stuff from the viewers and stayed true to the story. So I could even give this 10/10 because that's how good it was. I also did not expect it to be that good basing on how bad this 2023 Hollywood year, when you do watch something nice it is very shocking!","

"Gran Turismo","roaringbunny-373-992551","13 August 2023","Gran Turismo is by far the best movie overall that we've seen in a long, long time. If Barbie can make 1B already, this one should make 2B at least - because Gran Turismo far exceeds watchability! (you still should see Barbie, because as flawed as it is, Magot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are individually fantastic) But you will enjoy Gran Turismo much more.Gran Turismo is not complex, there's no propaganda, and of course, the action sequences require the Biggest Screen you can find for viewing, IMAX was stunning. Young, Old, and where ever you are on the political spectrum, this is just fun, sometimes sweet, direct storytelling with the best racing effects possible. This movie is the best investment this summer for your entertainment budget, without question.Don't be worried about reviews that mention Gamers - sure, they love it, and also so does everyone else, even those of us that still have a cassette Walkman around...","

It was a solid adaptation with some desirable better CGI quality but all in all it was a good watch.The length of the movie is fair it doesn't get boring at any point and keeps you hooked to the screen plus there are eastereggs here and there for GT fans to enjoy.If you're on the fence and a player of GT7 on PS5 or have played previous entries in the series then its a must watch and for other move goers it's much better than a lot of other stuff in the cinemas right now.","

"Gran Turismo","redcanofevil","29 September 2023","Another videogame movie, which not long ago would be code for bad movies that completely misses the mark. Luckily we're way past that and videogame movies have been a delight to watch. This is no popcorn-flick, this was actually a really solid movie. But it won't be for everyone, you need to be a fan of racing, you need to be a fan of GranTurismo on Playstation. GT is my favorite racing franchise and I love racing, I play GTsport on PS4 and still play GT6 on my PS3.The movie lives upto the games, I mean it wasn't that difficult to do so. But they did justice to the games. The shortcomings were definitely the barebones script, a stereotypical predictable ups and downs, the unnecessary dramatic photo finishes and the love angle. The acting was functional, there were emotions behind them at times but for the most part it wont blow anyone away. The main lead is a good example, he's not someone you'd wanna root for if you've never played a racing game. But if you have then you'd be cheering him on because he got to be where we all wish we could be playing on our controllers. He is carrying the unfulfilled hopes and dreams of all us gamers, rooting for him is natural because he becomes a self-insert. Orlando Bloom was flat, David Harbor atleast put some effort.As for the driving aspect, the game to real racing transition we're pretty amazing. The vibration and shaky cam were a joy, regret not watching it in theaters. I feel they could've done more on track racing but trust me, you wont realize this while watching.The direction was a letdown, the runtime a bit too long, the soundtrack mostly doesn't work but it somehow still fades when the actual racing begins. There were some really unrealistic parts in the movie, things that would never happen in real life but this isn't a documentary.Its not a perfect film but it does what it sets out to do. Inspire the feeling and keep the dream alive for the millions of racing game enthusiast that didn't get to race. If you can relate to this aspect then this is the film for you, if you are a casual it still should be a decent watch considering the low grade garbage we keep getting. And if you're not a fan of racing at all then why are you even watching this?","

"Gran Turismo","nmcarroll","3 December 2023","Two hour runtime that felt liket four. Just a massive marketing exercise for Sony, PlayStation and Nissan. The story is pretty boring and by the numbers. One of the worst movies I've seen in recent times. The lead character is unlikable. Furthermore, it just doesn't seem very believable. Looking up his record, he is an average driver in the real world at Best. It really looks like a movie that was aimed at 15-year-old gamers and nobody else. Awful stuff really. On the plus side, some of the camera will work during the races was great. That was a high pint, but it just took too long to get there.","

"Gran Turismo","nataliacorbillon","26 August 2023","Between all CGI packed superhero movies, 7 part of something and based on best sellers, watching something like this is the most fun I have had in a while at the cinema. I went with my kid who loves cars and videogames, so he is ecstatic after watching it obviously. But I found myself hyped from the beginning to the end. There's nothing too surprising or pretentious. It doesn't pretend to win an Oscar. It tells an inspiring story and entertains you, making you hold your breath in a few occasions. Shout out to Orlando Bloom, who finally got rid of the ""I am a pretty boy"" rol and after the first 5 minutes made me forget that it was him acting.Highly recommended.","

"Gran Turismo","mick-18173","28 August 2023","First off me and my girlfriend are movie enthusiasts and we were really only trying to see a film because it was national cinema day, but wow was I shocked by this movie. The trailer sucked and I believe the marketing team should 100 percent be held accountable for low audience turnout. The trailer didn't do the movie just at all. I was in a emotional rollercoaster all movie and how they portrayed the car scenes was like no other racing movie I've seen. A lot of people see this as sorta ""cringey"" because it's about a gamer, but I see it as something I've never seen before. Imagine you're sitting at home playing a sim game and you're chosen to be strapped into a 200mph machine. That is just absurd and before this movie I've never heard of that. Although some of the acting was mediocre during the drama scenes, it doesn't change the fact that this movie does an excellent job at showing not only the car in action but the realness of being behind the wheel. I give this movie a solid 8 and 100 percent believe if you like video games and or racing this is a movie you must see!","

The only racing movie i can say that is at thesame level is ford vs ferrari, the fact that this movie is a true life story is also a added advantage, the tracks, cars, locations and all just made it worth it, you can feel the tenson, the g force and all, lol, but as a sim racer i love this movie, i cant wait for it to come out in blu ray, this is by far the best playstation adaptation, big thumbs up guys, u did it.","

"Gran Turismo","shenamere","23 January 2024","Who doesn't like the sound of engines roaring and the excitement of a race. The competitive, come from behind, never say never, do or die, trust your gut, go for broke, believe in yourself and so on. The movie desperately tries to sell Gran Turismo games and NIssmo racing. Apart from that it is the teenager gamers showing the world how real a simulation is. The truth is a little different when searching for the Le Mans run by Nissmo. It didn't qualify and the project was disbanded. Not because of drivers, but because of the car. So enjoy the fantasy. Fantastic special effects. Great suspense and decent acting. Story line has expected hiccups to the finish. Feel the rush!","

"Gran Turismo","MovieLuver365","28 August 2023","I had high hopes for this movie. As an ""Unbelievable Inspiring Story"", it falls a bit flat. In fact, there was something missing from the entire movie that makes it all seem flat and one dimrnsional.can't put my finger on it, but it just seemed cheap and ""B"".I was also hoping that there would be more emphasis on the challenges associated with moving from the virtual to the real world, but they didn't delve much into that, just could he do it, yes or no.I walked out once he qualified for the racing team. I didn't think it could end better than the movie had already been. If he won, i simply could not have suspended my disbelief in order to enjoy it. If he didn't, well, at that point it would have just been sad.There was a scene in the beginning that could have foreshadowed a good movie. The scene where his father wanted him to come out and play futbol. How to succeed in the physical world. That's what he needed to learn all along. But those intracacies were not explored, even in a 2+ hour movie.Djimon Hounsou was excellent, and delivered what I thought to be the best performance in the film. I remember him from Gladiator and Blood Diamond. Whatever ""it"" is, he's got it. :)I hope to see this ""conversion"" issue addressed in upcoming movies. Our youth need to learn how to live in the real world, and what better way than the movies? :)","

"Gran Turismo","markospohn","11 February 2024","Maybe some spoilers here...Well i am a big GT fan and i played it a lot and maybe thats the problem. The film can give excitement and makes you feel good but as a racing fan and as a GT fan in particular there are some things that are simply stupid or make the film look bad.Literally noone plays with the racing line and braking zones on. Maybe as a noob on your first playthrough but noone ever on a competitive level will do this.Its a cool effect to see the car build virtually around Jann while he ist driving but seeing the brakes going red and then hearing only accelerating sounds is bad.There are a lot of stupid phrases like press the gas pedal harder. Only someone with no experience will say such stuff.Same with the ""opportunity"" for overtaking. Noone can overtake into a corner by downshifitg and the giving full throttle. Again simply stupid if you ever seen a real race or played GT.Same with the gap of 6 seconds or more and gaining i this in less than 1 lap. 1 tenth can make you start from 1oth playe instead of pole position thats so much time in racing its ridiculous to gain that time in one lap.Lame conversation and cheering on the guy by saying ther can only be one winner. Yawn...nothing really special.And almost all of the overtakings are like fake overtakes that are only possible if you have 100 horsepower more or are simply unrealistic.I think the more you know about racing the less you will enjoy that movie. Its like the 12 gear cars in NFS.","

"Gran Turismo","moorejw-52415","1 October 2023","For the excellent effects and Ginger Spice.Casting was all over the place on this one. Djimon Hounsou plays the same character in every movie, and doesn't even look like the actual Steven Mardenborough. The scenes that he has with Archie Madekwe are a master class in mumbling. Thank god for subtitles.The inclusion of the small details lent a hand to the immersion of the game. From the satisfying Playstation sounds to the incredible shots of specific mechanics within the cars, this made me fell in love with the ""game"" again. It was one of the first I had played on the original PS console.Also, Ginger Spice! 💃",NA
"Gran Turismo","juliocesarprava","15 August 2023","The movie feels much more like a video game than a story based on real events. The racers always head straight to big races without any training, and every race has a highly catastrophic accident, just like in a video game.The accident involving the real-life driver was well executed; the video can be found on YouTube.Some cheesy and repetitive jokes like ""noob"" or ""I'm going to nerf you."" Nobody talks like that in the real world; this attempt to insert gamer language feels forced.The actors are good, with David Harbour standing out; the exception is Orlando Bloom, who is extremely caricatured and exaggerated.In the history has an unnecessary romance and a cliché spoiled rich villain.The race shots and audio are excellent, but the shots that intercut with game graphics scenes are unnecessary, it is like ads.The music always tries to push you into feeling the drama, but the story develops at a decent pace.It could have been better, but overall, it's a good racing movie. At times, you'll find yourself accelerating with the protagonist.",NA
