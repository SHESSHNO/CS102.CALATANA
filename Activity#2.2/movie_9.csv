"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","JoeYabuki","5 June 2019","Great and Amazing battles/fights among giant monsters, epic and spectacular ones, what everybody was waiting for, if you want to enjoy good monsters and CGI this is you movie, go watch it on the best screen 8.5/10... But the plot is weak, people are stupid and make meaningless decisions. People's behavior is absurd, with a lot of boring drama that nobody cares, in addition the actors who are supposed to be the main ones have no time on screen. A Total disappointment.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","imrigu","2 July 2020","Godzilla!! Oh lord, i can only think of what this film could've done with a great plot. It could be one of the most memorable and exciting moments of film addicts but sadly it was a horrible experience.What a dumb plot, i only continued to watch because of Godzilla and other monsters. Every other human being is dying and we're supposed to follow a selfish woman who tried to destroy earth and her daughter who saved the earth. Wow what a plot! And and we're also supposed to feel sad for the sacrifice of evil woman why? cause she sacrificed herself. Dumbo!I'm not going to discuss the plot holes since everything about human makes little sense, but the back story of monsters is amazing.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","OllieSuave-007","25 January 2021","This is the second Godzilla film in the MonsterVerse series, a story about the crypto-zoological agency Monarch finding themselves facing titan monsters Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah, and their ultimate solution is letting Godzilla battle them all to save mankind.The film is a little reminiscing to Toho Studio's classic 1964 movie, Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, but this time featuring the monsters in the 21st century, with some neat special effects. You get to see each of the monsters' unyielding powers and characteristics, and them battling each other is nothing short of edge-of-your-seat monster excitement. However, the CGI on the creatures were too dark at times, making the monster battles hard to see. It is also difficult to see the creatures' faces and reactions - just a whole lot of head-spinning movements and swift actions.The human drama was average at best, and the good guys vs. bad guys subplot was a major distraction from the film, I thought. Much of the evil doers' actions were overkill, and our protagonists were too preachy, save for Ziyi Zhang's duo doctor roles, which is a great nod to Mothra's tiny twin priestesses in the classic films. I also liked that the filmmakers incorporated Mothra's Song in this movie.But, as with much of today's films, there is forced comedy to lighten up the mood, courtesy of Bradley Whitford's St. Stanton character. His humor was extremely annoying and distracting, very out-of-place for the movie.With all the hard-to-see monster action to the distracting human drama, there is too much in the film to digest and makes it hard to appreciate the main point, which are clearly the monsters. It leaves little room to sympathize with the human characters and leaves you craving for more of the monsters.Grade D+","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Mickdrew99","5 June 2019","Crazy review title right? Well you might agree after watching this movie.You'll probably hear a lot of opinions from people who aren't homegrown Godzilla fans - and they will have their own thoughts on this.
I, on the other hand, am a big fan of the monster going years back. Finding a Godzilla movie in the TV guide, or a DVD for one of the Toho movies to rent was like winning the lottery when my brother and I were young.Here are my thoughts plainly stated: Yes, this is a better Godzilla film than the 2014 movie. There are *aspects* of the latter that some might say make it superior, but that would only make it a better movie in general - as a *Godzilla movie* this new one is quite a bit better.Don't listen to the people on RottenTomatoes talking about how ""the special effects are overly relied on and can't make up for the bad characters and plot.""
No. Those CG monsters are the best part, and they almost singlehandedly save this movie. The solution is not to focus less on special effects and develop the characters better. The solution is to have every human character stepped on in the second act and have the last 45 min center the story solely on the monsters - which I guess would mostly be fighting.The problem is this does not happen. Every moment you see the monsters battle, you enter a brief moment of bliss before you are ripped away to deal with people you don't care about doing things you hope they fail at. The first ""clash"" occurs in Antarctica, and that scene was actually quite good despite the focus on the humans. You're just now being exposed to these titans duking it out, so having people there witnessing the madness and trying to escape help play into how incredible this event truly is.By the 3rd act, however, this tolerance has dried up. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't a movie titled ""Godzilla"" imply that he is the main character? Because he doesn't feel like one. Without a doubt, THE biggest problem that Godzilla (2014) and this film have is they place waaayyyy too much value on human beings. Everyone in the audience is waiting for them to shut up and go away, but the movie has its head up its ass and thinks what they're doing is somehow important and worth focusing on. It would be like two warriors facing off, and having most of the climax focusing on ants running around on the ground trying to save each other.The only ""characters"" here that need development are the Kaijus. Have them be your stars. Have them be the focus. It doesn't just have to be mindless action like how snobby people will pretend that's all we want to see. Go ahead and tell a story, but NOT with people. They are not the reason we're watching this, and we don't care about them.One exception to what I said in the previous paragraph: Ken Watanabe
His big character moment was incredible. If you must have human beings involved, do them like this. He was amazing.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","phd_travel","2 January 2020","Too much of the same thing. The story and characters were not well developed. Just climax after climax. Explosions and fights seemed repetitive. Vera Farmiga's character seemed too smart to be so dumb. And Zhang Ziyi didn't deliver her lines convincingly.Destruction of cities wasn't well done. Just seemed superficial and far away.Waste of lots of effects. Spending more money doesn't mean a better movie. Sometimes less is more. A simpler movie like the Korean monster movie The Host was so much more involving because you were invested in the characters and the creature wasn't too big.Don't bother.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Hitchcoc","31 May 2019","With all the films and the mastery of special effects, we take for granted that movie monsters are going to be quite remarkable. I enjoyed watching them, especially Ghidrah. But then we have this lame plot with a nutcase deciding it would be good for the earth if most of the people were eliminated and we started over. The female/mother character has bought into this and is about to send the world to oblivion. The acting is so bad and the actions of the characters ridiculous. Standing around while nuclear radiation is a few feet away. Or a monster is right in front of them. Leaving a submarine and standing on the tower while Godzilla appears, instead of staying submerged. And the search fo the daughter at Fenway Park. I have to give credit. It was certainly loud but like watching a Star Trek episode, I challenge anyone to really understand the science. I wish it had been a better, more gripping story. Finally, like so many movies of its type, the loss of life is beyond belief and people don't seem all that concerned about their brothers and sisters.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kbayless-1","5 June 2019","Ever since the perfection of CGI, Hollywood has come to the conclusion that if the special effects are good, then then movie is good. Thus, my 5 star rating. Half of the movie involved the monster battles and that gets 10 stars. The half of the movie where there is no monster presence gets 0. That averages out to a 5. Perhaps some day Hollywood will re-discover the lost art of screen writing and combine it with CGI to create a truly fantastic movie. But don't look for it to change soon. A lot of people came out of the theater visually dazzled by the special effects knowing that the story was awful but still thought it was a great movie. So they will continue make a lot of money creating these kind of movies and save on time & expense by not having to pay top dollar for a writer.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ericrnolan","23 August 2019","It's true what they say about ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" (2019) - its script is almost completely brainless. It's got about as much depth as the old ""G.I. Joe"" cartoon (1983-1986) that played after school when we were kids.But I'd be lying to you if I said I didn't enjoy this. And I'm sure you know why - the big-budget, big-MONSTER special effects. They were spectacular - and sometimes they approached being unexpectedly beautiful. (It's hard to explain here, but our eyes are treated to more than skyscraper-tall brawls between ""titans."" We get a light show too - thanks to some confusing, thinly scripted, but nonetheless dazzling energy-based monster powers. It was really damned good.)Add to this a generally excellent cast, and you might be able to forgive the screenplay for insulting your intelligence. I know that most people would name Ken Watanabe as the actor who truly classes up the joint. And there's plenty of truth to that, but I myself would name Charles Dance as the movie's biggest standout. The man's craft is goddam Shakespearean, and I think he's equal of the likes of Patrick Stewart or Ian McKellen. And I'd like to think that his throwaway line, ""Long live the King,"" was at least partly a fan-service reference to what I'm guessing is his best known role - Tywin Lannister on HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" (2011-2019).Based on my own enjoyment, I'd rate this movie an 8 out of 10 - with the caveat that I'm a kid at heart when it comes to giant monsters. If you're the same way, then ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" might just become a guilty pleasure that you return to more than once.","

The acting is awful. It's unfair having a go at a kid, but, the young lady from Stranger Things, simply hams all over the screen - a few acting lessons wouldn't go amiss. However, the whole cast are poor, then again, they had nothing to work with.There is the obligatory heavy handed neo PC male-bad/female-good, intelligent, wise & strong theme running through the movie - which appears to be insidiously pumped into 90% of Hollywood blockbusters of late. Also, f-bombs (as our American cousins would say) are dropped - kids movie?Just awful!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ThomasDrufke","5 June 2019","Remember when the biggest complaint of the 2014 Godzilla movie was the titular characters' lack of presence? And how the director (Gareth Edwards) made the specific choice to keep cutting away from shots of Godzilla in favor of the human story involving Elizabeth Olsen & Aaron Taylor-Johnson? Well, I'm not pleased to say Michael Dougherty took that criticism and threw it out the window. Instead of 25-30 minutes of screentime like it was in 2014, Godzilla is in this film for about 35-45 minutes. He doesn't even enter the film until 40 minutes in, takes a nap in the middle act, and has a pretty cool final fight with Ghidorah. And that's basically your movie. I understand having a human side to these stories is essentially unavoidable, but then don't spend millions on great actors, cut down the runtime, and spend the remaining budget on more CGI monsters. Or better yet, stop making the same dang story with these 'classic' monsters around them. 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' is pretty close to a train wreck.3.5/1","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","MOscarbradley","6 June 2019","As big, dumb monster movies go they don't come any bigger, and certainly any dumber, than ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"". It's neither a sequel to, and certainly not a remake of, any of the previous Godzilla films but just another addition to a franchise that should have been exterminated long before now. This is a Grade A turkey if I ever saw one, a film with neither stars nor actors, (sorry, Vera Farmiga; sorry, Sally Hawkins), in which all the money has been poured into the monsters, (and there are a lot of monsters), and the battles between the monsters which are then shot in either darkness or semi-darkness so it's virtually impossible to know what's going on. The plot could be written on a postage stamp and the special effects are wasted in a plethora of fast-cutting, stormy seas and exploding mountains and while Godzilla may be the good guy, he's hardly in the picture at all.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Prismark10","4 March 2020","The sequel to 2014's Godzilla has gone for monster mayhem. Unfortunately despite the destruction, it looks like cheap CGI and a brain dead dull story.It starts off as a kind of revenge movie. Kyle Chandler is a scientists called Mark Russell who is still mourning the loss of his son after Godzilla's rampage in San Francisco in the previous film. Mark views Godzilla as the enemy.His estranged wife Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is a member of Monarch. The group that looks for monsters such as Godzilla to study.As Dr Russell is studying a creature called Mothra, They are attacked by eco-terrorists led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance.) He takes Dr Russell and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as well as a machine called Orca which can control the behaviour of the monsters.It transpires that Dr Russell is in league with Jonah. Mark Russell rejoins Monarch to rescue his daughter. However as various monsters are unleashed, he realises that only Godzilla can save the day.The story is bland, the characters are flat. Everytime the movie focuses on the human it is a snoozefest. When there are monster fights, the film literally brightens up as but you also notice that some of the CGI is poor.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","shawthingproductions","30 May 2019","I loved the first Godzilla film. I loved Kong: Skull Island. As far as monsters beating monsters up, I enjoyed ""Rampage"" so - you know - I don't go into these films expecting a lot but this was an over long mess.The positives: the Titans looked good and.... That's it.The score was uninspiring, the acting was atrocious (and from actors you KNOW are capable of more than this), the plot was all over the place, the dialogue was laughable (I wonder how many times random people did say ""Long Live The King"") and there are issues with the logistics which bugged me too - although I should have let those go given it's a Godzilla film. The latter point being: How many nukes do they let off and surely that means anyone who comes within a few miles of Godzilla would die anyway whether he stamped on them or not. But yeah, we will leave that point there.Was it cool watching the monsters fight at least? Well no - it was dull. They looked great but the fights were more of the same the whole way through. You see the first fight, you're watching that again and again and again and again and again and... You get the picture). The film is over two hours. I had two naps. Each time I woke up, I wished I hadn't. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I was with my partner and I thought they were enjoying it. Only at the end when we talked about the film did they admit to wishing they'd left half way through.The plot itself was stupid. SPOILERS AHEAD.... Charles Dance's character was him literally phoning the performance in and whilst I understood he was an eco-terrorist, the other ""villain's"" reasoning for waking the titans up was just dumb, more so when it cost the lives of people they loved. Then, just to change their mind at the end with little provocation - it just didn't make sense and grated me more than I was already annoyed.I regret wasting my time with this film.","

The movie starts off absolutely ridiculous. Very unrealistic scene that didn't make any sense. There are lot of scenes in the movie that literally just made no sense at all. The fight scenes were awful. They barely showed the monsters fighting and focused more on the human characters. In the middle of a fight scene I don't care what the humans are doing. The humans are literally right in the middle of the monster fight scene, right next to them and flames, shards, everything is flying around the human characters but yet none of them got injured or hurt all. Very unrealistic. The fight scenes were also very dark, and no this wasn't my tv. The scenes were literally dark, I had to turn the brightness up just to see what was going on. Horrible graphics. It was like I was watching a bad cartoon. Godzilla had no detail features. He literally looked like just a dark blob. The girl from ""stranger things"" is so bad in it. I never realized how bad of an actor she was. She was calling all the shots in the film which was just stupid. Her mother in the film was doing a ton of things that no mother would do and that made NO SENSE. The 2014 Godzilla film was pretty good overall and the fight scenes were great, but it was nothing to brag about. This film makes the 2014 film Oscar worthy. This is definitely one of the worst films I've seen in a very very long time. It was torture having to sit through it for 2 hours and 10 minutes. The. Only reason we kept watching it was because we want to see the new Godzilla vs. Kong which is a follow up to this 2019 Godzilla film and Kong: Skull Island (which was amazing by the way. Highly recommend Kong: Skull Island). If you can spare yourself from watching this movie just fast forward it until the end. Wish we would have done that.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","nogodnomasters","12 June 2019","This is a sequel to the Bryan Cranston Godzilla film which was not one of my favorites. This one went downhill as the basic plot consisted of Emma (Vera Farmiga) going Ben Tre all over the world. Her daughter (Millie Bobby Brown) takes a stab at saving Red Sox nation. Couldn't they get a cute kid to play her part?There was a lot of multi-million dollar destruction scenes that I can't see paying for themselves. The story was so bad, I was surprised to see that the lips match the sound. If you are going to watch just one blockbuster this summer, make sure this is not it.","

Gojira aka Godzilla faces off against Monster zero,King Ghidrah . And others join the battle; Mothra and Rodan. With some surprises.I loved this from beginning to end. An epic that cannot be missed. The Big G returns in all his glory. Next up is a team up with King Kong in 2020. And who knows maybe a grand remake of Destroy All Monsters.this movie rocks and I know will break the Abengers record at the box office. And it should.

This monstrous stupidity had it all - annoying kids, predictable script, cringy lines, stupid characters making stupid decisions, climate change propaganda. And it wasn't even a cleverly disguised propaganda. You know, there could've been at least a slight attempt to disguise it. But no, it was all in-your-face complete distortion of what ecology means, boiled down to ""humans bad they must die"". The director of this movie is some unknown hack who directed ""Superman returns"". This is all we have to know about him to learn everything there is to know.

The ONLY good performance & actor in the film was VERA FARMIGA as she's a great actor but the rest was dull & so boring to watch.The monsters when they are seen are ok but nothing special as they're shown in deep water mostly in dark blue light & are just basic c.g.i monsters none look that good or interesting or Awesome which is terrible for a big fx creature feature about cool monsters!!!The story just very slowly plods along & just keeps showing us boring humans in bases or boats or vehicles & it's very boring.
""Kong: Skull Island"" was a million times better than this BORING film & the 1998 Godzilla film is still the best version of Godzilla.","

The writing is bad, the acting sucks, it's so serious and throws in lame scenes of melodrama for characters we don't even care about. Looking for that Oscar moment lol. And how does a kid figure out a device that was only created recently, and only one other person knows how to use it?! The monster action, which should have been the best part, is barely visible. If it's not shakey came, its extreme close-up cam. And they hide all the fights with Ghidorah in a made up storm cloud that apparently follows Monster Zero around. Come on, they're not even trying hard to hide the fact it's bad CGI. And people are able to run through explosions, into areas where monsters are fighting, and not get even a scratch?! How does Vera Fermiga's character drive a Hummer into the middle of a stadium that has been destroyed by the monsters fighting?! And she drives out again after even more carnage. Stupid stupid. But the icing on the cake of this horrible mess: It's dimly lit. Yes, you heard me, every scene is dark. Nobody apparently has light bulbs when they are indoors. And when they are outdoors, and its sunny, it's as if you are looking at everything through dark sunglasses. Terrible. Mostly likely done because they messed up the effects, and had to conceal how bad it was.

A homage to the original films with both a plethora of historical creatures and some grand special effects. It certainly won't disappoint in this respect, although movie critics will certainly pick up on the lack of real substance and a fairly lightweight, human relationship. Overall though a decent effort and I enjoyed the film on the level presented. The thrilling soundtrack (that uses the original Godzilla music) is also worth a mention.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","theromanempire-1","8 June 2019","I am a die hard fan of toho sci-fi films. I own everything there is about kaiju universe and have watched every single toho Godzilla film numerous times in dvd and most of those films in a theater back at the time.The first 1998 American remake was an entertaining movie but never the less a failure for the real Godzilla toho fans.the 2014 version was a vast improvement as it was closer to the real feeling a Godzilla movie should have.
this new remake had even greater connection to the earlier Japanese Godzilla flicks.
finally we got to see a big budget film with king ghidorah ... rodan..mothra which is reason enough to go watch this film if u are a toho Godzilla fan like me.unfortunately the film had scenario issues they could find a better explanation as to why the monsters were released but at least they tried with that part to explain and there were also messages about the survival of our nation.
another negative was they did not shown a lot of the rest of the 14 like monsters they were set free.
besides the big four we saw only a glimpse of 2-3 other monsters. the mutos a kind of mammouth which I don't remember to feature in any of the Japanese Godzilla films and I think I saw kamakutra a well known kaiju from the film Godzilla vs the sea monster (1966)
where are the rest of the monsters ?
where are gorosaurus...manda....anguiras....varan....baragon.....mechagodzilla....spacegodzilla...destroyer....gigan....and so many others ?
they could have included a scene like that in destroy all monsters film in which we can see manda destroy paris...etc..etc
anyways those were the only two minors the movie had.
as for the rest the movie was great. the monsters looked great. the fights were long and fabulous.
For those who complaint about that.......it's a Godzilla movie. it's supposed to have long fights.
This movie is in essence a remake of destroy all monsters 1969 movie or also a remake to king ghidorah 1964 and it's sequel Godzilla vs monster zero 1965.
if u watch those 3 movies u will find that this movie was based on those 3 earlier toho films.
All in all it was great to see those past forgotten kaiju monsters fight in a big budget film with Godzilla and next year we get finally Godzilla vs king kong remake 58 long years after the release of the original.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","mhorg2018","2 June 2019","Ok, first the critics, who are paid mercenaries, are wrong. Very few times does any Kaiju fan care about the human characters. They exist for one reason: to move the story forward. The last time I cared about human characters in a Godzilla film was the 1954 version. And that's because those characters were important. In the following succession of films, until the 90's and especially in the 70's, the characters were either throw away or annoying kids. This film was a love letter to the fans. There were so many Easter eggs for the fans that it was ridiculous! I almost couldn't keep up with them.This movie gives the fans what they want: Godzilla fighting his most famous enemy: Ghidorah. It's a lot of fun and it's the kind of movie one goes to see and just loses oneself in. Tremendous fun!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","cruise01","1 June 2019","Godzilla: King of the Monsters (5 out of 5 stars).Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a giant exploding blockbuster that delivers a movie that has epic action set pieces, visual effects, and a great cast ensemble. Story wise you cannot expect it to have a big story. It delivers with a story that can open up for more movies as it follows the concept of a monarch which they are researching and searching for titans and believed that the titans once rule the world.The plot opens up a little more about the world of titans and monarch. The story follows Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) who has created a device called the orca which can communicate with the titans. King Ghidorah is awakened which is like a three headed dragon that wakes up other titans around the world. It is up to Dr. Mark (Kyle Chandler) and the monarch group led by Dr. Ishiro (Ken Watanabe) to track Godzilla and aid him as Godzilla battles against King Ghidorah and Rodan. Mark is trying to save his daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as the world is falling into havoc.The plot does open up with the idea of using an orca device that can communicate with the titans. But if its put on the wrong hands, it can lead into bigger trouble. The first film took its time for the build up with Godzilla while showing brief parts of him at a time until the climatic battle. This sequel does not wait to show him fighting. The film builds up with the first 15 minutes with showing a family struggling emotionally about their past and loss. When King Ghidorah is awakened. The film lets loose with its epic visual effects battle when Godzilla shows up in the first half hour of the movie.Definitely, one of the best action packed films. It is big, loud, and has plenty of action set pieces to keep you on the edge of your seat. With Dr. Mark and the monarch flying from one location to another trying to evacuate cities with the beasts waking up. There is Mothra, which is a beautiful and colorful moth. Then, there is Rodan, which is a demonic bird-looking thing that lives in a volcano. And King Ghidorah is an unstoppable force of a three-headed beast. The visual effects are amazing. The action is spectacular.The cast ensemble is also good as well. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown were great. Charles Dance playing a villain type of character that believes the world is facing extinction cause of overpopulation and the pollution people are causing. And that the titans are the balance that can help reset the world's balance.The music score is also good as well that helped build up the suspense and thrills from music composer Bear McCreary. The film does set up for another movie which will be exciting to see. Plus there is a post credit scene which may hint towards a sequel.Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an epic awesome film that delivers spectacular action sequences with Godzilla battling with the monsters and the mass destruction. The visual effects, the cast ensemble, and the music score are great. Definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen possible.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Leofwine_draca","23 November 2019","GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is a film much like its 2014 predecessor: average and interesting, but too flawed to have much in the way of rewatchability. I come to it as a huge fan of the Japanese kaiju genre; those rubber-suited bouts of the 1960s mark the high point of the genre to me, so this overlong epic is something I have a mixed reaction to. As before, the human storylines drag down the pacing and make this going on too much, and the staged conflict is boring at times.I like Millie Bobby Brown in STRANGER THINGS but she feels out of place here, tacked-on to appeal to that demographic. Kyle Chandler is also the most uninspiring protagonist I can imagine, although better actors like Ken Watanabe and Charles Dance are assured in smaller roles. There's copious monster action here as you'd expect, and I was delighted that not only does King Ghidorah show up but Mothra and Rodan too, with the right nods made to the original mythologies. But the CGI isn't quite as good as I was hoping for and the action becomes mildly repetitive before long.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","dee.reid","1 June 2019","Ever since the back-to-back successes of South Korea's ""The Host"" (2006), ""Cloverfield"" (2008), ""Pacific Rim"" (2013), ""Godzilla"" (2014) and ""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017), Hollywood has seen an increase in the popularity, and legitimacy, of giant monster movies - which began with ""King Kong"" (1933), but really didn't begin to take off until Japan's ""Gojira"" (1954) introduced to the world over the mighty ""King Of The Monsters"" Himself, the giant fire-breathing mutant dinosaur Godzilla.There's something to be said about Godzilla, who has not always had a warm reception with American audiences. For those of us who grew up watching the original Japanese Toho-backed ""kaiju-eiga"" (Japanese monster movie) features, Godzilla was the best and most famous of them all. We watched him fight other giant monsters (daikaiju) in increasingly silly plots and laughable special effects and horrible English-language dubbing; of course, this is because for many years, only badly edited versions of the original Japanese movies were all that was available stateside, and poor-quality bootlegs of the original uncut Japanese versions of the movies became highly sought-after collector's items. (However, DVD has made legitimate, high-quality prints of the original Japanese movies available domestically.)But to the Japanese and die-hards who took the films much more seriously than the average film-goer, Godzilla represented mankind's worst fears about the Atomic Age and nuclear warfare, being that Godzilla was the ""son of the atom bomb"" and was a living manifestation OF the power of the atomic bomb itself. Of course, this got lost over the years as Godzilla was transformed into a superhero over the course of the first-generation Showa-Era (1954-1975) series, later returning to his roots as a rampaging menace/anti-hero in the second- and third-generation Heisei-Era (1984-1995) and Millennium-Era (1999-2004) film series.In between those series, Hollywood took a stab at bringing the Big Green Guy stateside with the laughable ""Godzilla"" (1998); I saw ""Godzilla"" six times in the theater as an impressionable 12-year-old. ""Godzilla"" failed to make an impression with audiences and die-hard fans, but has nonetheless become something of a cult film in its own right, however marginalized it may be. But then Britisher Gareth Edwards gave the Big Green Guy a proper American update with his 2014 ""Godzilla,"" which I saw in the theater THREE times in just as many days as an impressionable 29-year-old, and with different friends each time. (The Japanese would also resurrect the King of the Monsters for themselves with 2016's ""Shin Gojira""/""Godzilla: Resurgence,"" which I also saw in the theater during a very limited one-week theatrical engagement here in the United States.)Of course, ""Godzilla"" was just the first in a potential franchise, and expanded cinematic universe - like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) - with joint backing by both Legendary Pictures and Japan's Toho. Those theories were confirmed over the next five years when it was revealed that in five years time, a second ""Godzilla"" feature would appear, and we finally got that with ""Krampus"" Michael Dougherty's largely superior 2019 sequel, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters.""Now this is the giant monster movie sequel we've been waiting to see in American theaters for the past five years. As a life-long Godzilla fan, I didn't go into the picture with any unrealistically high expectations, but I did come out of it fairly surprised at what I'd seen, and no, the movie is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but you get what you pay for, in my honest opinion. The film is steeped in reverence for the original Japanese film series - and hardcore Godzilla fans should have a ball pointing out some of the eagle-eyed/dog-eared references to said original Japanese film series (and even American ""B"" movies from the '50s, like ""The Giant Claw"" from 1957); did anybody catch those references to ""Terror of Mechagodzilla"" (1975), or the Heisei-Era features ""Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah"" (1991), ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II"" (1993) and ""Godzilla vs. Destoroyah"" (1995), OR the Millennium-Era entry ""Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S."" (2003)?(See what I mean? Such references show that the filmmakers geared ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" to hardcore Godzilla fans at the cost of a more generalized audience - which, to me, is probably the film's greatest shortcoming.)However, beforehand, I did know a few details from Internet gossip over the intervening years. Essentially an Americanized, high-dollar remake of the Showa-Era classic ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"" (1964) - and throwing in a rather ham-fisted environmentalist subtext - ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" not only brings back Godzilla, but it also introduces to American audiences for the first time not one, not two, but THREE other classic monsters from the original Japanese ""Godzilla"" film series.Unlike ""Godzilla,"" this sequel wastes no time in introducing us to the monsters (now referred to here as ""titans""), who, following the events of ""Godzilla"" in 2014, are starting to become a common, everyday fact of life - in much the same way giant monsters were seen in the original Japanese film series. The King of the Monsters finds himself battling Mothra, Rodan and his first arch-nemesis from the original Japanese film series, the three-headed lightning-breathing dragon King Ghidorah (a.k.a., ""Monster Zero""). (Also in introducing these monsters for the first time to a Western audience, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" contains assorted references to Rodan's 1956 first appearance, Mothra's 1961 first appearance, and King Ghidorah's first appearance in 1964.)In between these epic-sized, city-destroying monster battles, Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his assistant Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) of the clandestine monster-detecting agency Monarch return from the first film, along with plenty of newcomers including Drs. Sam Coleman (Thomas Middleditch), Ilene Chen and her twin sister Ling Chen (both portrayed by Ziyi Zhang) and Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford), and also a fractured family - Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), who embarks on a globe-spanning odyssey chasing after his estranged ex-wife Emma (Vera Farmiga), after she and their teenage daughter Madison (""Stranger Things"" Millie Bobby Brown) are abducted by the English eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance). Jonah wants to use a device called the ""Orca"" that Emma constructed to locate and awaken other titans in order to take the world back from humans and return it to the monsters.(A large ensemble cast such as this harks back to the original Japanese film series, which shows that Legendary is starting to get a firmer understanding of how these films truly worked and why they appealed to so many fans after all these years. Additionally, the film's score - by Bear McCreary - contains many familiar themes originally composed by long-time ""Godzilla"" series orchestrator Akira Ifukube, who remained Japan's most esteemed music composer up until his death in 2006; the end credits also features a tongue-in-cheek cover of Blue Oyster Cult's tongue-in-cheek classic ""Godzilla"" by System of a Down front-man Serj Tankian.)""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" will most likely not disappoint its hardcore audience, but one could say that figuratively and literally, this is the biggest giant monster movie ever made. Michael Dougherty and co-screenwriter Zach Shields (working from their shared screen-story with Max Borenstein) had an enormous task in front of them, and for the most part they succeed - even if some monsters (Mothra) are short-changed for screen-time in the end and there's some unnecessarily awkward, and forced, humor moments that can detract from the seriousness of the proceedings.But this is a film this Godzilla fan truly enjoyed.Long Live The King.10/10P.S.: The film also contains heartfelt tributes to long-time Toho producer Yoshimitsu Banno and original Godzilla suit-mation performer Haruo Nakajima - both of whom sadly passed away in 2017.","

Scientists couple Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) lost their son in the destruction of San Francisco. Emma is now working for Monarch in China to birth a Titan called Mothra and communicate with it using ORCA. When the base is attacked, Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are taken prisoners. Mark rejoins Monarch to rescue his family. The organization is threatened with folding under the US military. Instead of the possibly impossible task of annihilating the Titans, Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) could only suggest living under their domination.The premise is that the Earth is hollow. A Titan comes from space or not. Monarch has a giant super plane that can fly around the world forever. There are way too many people willing to Thanos the Earth. It goes on and on. It's a crazy mess of questionable ideas. The narrative doesn't really work. This should follow Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown. At least, they're interesting. The action is all encompassing without the tension of stakes. It's a lot rainy CGI. I do appreciate the intent of the monster-sized action but the human-sized drama is poor.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","FeastMode","27 July 2019","Started out looking like it was going to be good. Turned out to be a mediocre to bad movie. The action was decent for the most part, although i couldn't tell what was happening a lot of the time. The same goes for the rest of the movie, not just the action scenes. It was sloppy. Wasn't sure where everyone was or what they were doing. The human parts were pretty much garbage, but were played by good actors which made it easier to swallow.Story stupid. Characters non-existent. Decision-making questionable. But as with kong skull island, i should have been able to enjoy this as a mindless monster movie. I enjoyed some of it. But as an overall experience, i was mostly annoyed. And as the movie goes on, the cheese and cliches come out from hiding. Movie makers should have a cliche team, to catch any possible cliches. Doesn't make sense that they are still so prevalent (2 viewings, 3/30/2021)SPOILERSbiggest eye-rolling moment in the movie, they are driving fast. The guy in the back seat says ""if i had these two for parents, i'd run away from home, too."" driver slams on the breaks... ""what did you say?"" guy in the back seat repeats everything he just says. Driver and passenger (ex-spouses) turn to each other and yell ""HOME"" to signify that they knew where there daughter was going. S..... M....... H. Not only does the connection make zero sense, not only does it make zero sense to stop the car, but why if the effing eff do they need him to repeat what he said in order to finally figure it out. My second viewing was at home and i had to pause the movie from how much that one hurt me.This formula is becoming so obvious. The producers want a blockbuster that plays to a global market. So they have a premise (monsters fighting monsters), they add a wide variety of actors of different races (i'm a proponent of diverse hiring but this reeks of doing it for money, a token character of each race to draw in that demographic), and a simple but useless human story. Add some terribly written jokes, and sprinkle it with cliches like fake deaths, and of course, the obligatory self-sacrifice (this one had THREE OF THEM. Have you no shame???) it's like everyone is trying (and failing) to copy what the MCU has done so successfully. It's getting really annoying. Oh and the taking turns completing each other's sentences. Grrrrrrrr. NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT.","

I've watched the 3 American versions, the new Mosterverse addition of Kong: Skull Island and about 7, maybe 8, of the remaining 25ish films.But, this isn't like James Bond. Right before 2012's Skyfall came out, again, I had only seen about 7 of the 25 Bond movies to that date (including the offspring no one seems to care about, Never Say Never Again.) So, I did a full Bondathon and watched all official/non-official 007 films. Here, in 'Zilla's case...I don't think I could stand THAT much cheese.So, going from what I know, the original 1954 Godzilla, 2014's Godzilla and this one, are the absolute three best I've seen. Only, King of the Monsters...probably shot its load a little too much.This was the Monsterverse's Avengers movie but times twenty. Probably overkill on the ideas and tie-ins to the previous movies, but I still really liked this movie a ton. I had an incredible amount of fun and satisfaction of how much screen time both Godzilla and other kaiju had.The gist of this sequel is: 5 years (in real time, as well) passed since Godzilla's ""first"" appearance and not a word from any titan...but, of course, Congress is bent on doing more damage to the Monster University, Monarch, than any giant creature. Simultaneously, humans from both sides of all issues fight for their say while the monsters rise for dominance. Now (us as the audience): Let them fight.The movie's hardly perfect and mostly gets weighed down from the bickering humans and a too-long subplot of getting one's daughter back. Not to mention everyone's motivations take waaay too long to realize and when explained, it's hard to know where to side, period.But, like in any Godzilla or kaiju movie, we're not here for the characters. I just always pray, they don't dominate 95% of the screen time away from Godzilla and pals like they did in that terrible Shin Godzilla flick. Here, it was probably 60/40% in favor of the humans. What we saw in that 40% was all I wanted as my little inner-boy was all starry-eyed in wonder. Finally the Godzilla movies I saw as a kid came to life on the big screen with the best CGI money can buy.Yes, this, the 2014 Godzilla and Kong's latest outing have incredible special effects and a huge plus in seeing all the previous movies made with the proper technology. And, now, going back to my Japan quip...Shin Godzilla, which came out post-2014 Godzilla, had some of the WORST effects I've seen since Sharknado. I am completely baffled that Japan, the originator of Godzilla, would take gigantic leaps backwards while the USA, an imitator, takes massive leaps forward. There wasn't a single scene in the Monarch trilogy that I didn't believe was happening as if it were made practically.Yes, some of the puny human scenes were distracting, but I didn't come for them. I came for a big bulk of giant fights and giants, in general. I was not let down. Before I even saw this, I had already planned my second viewing: taking my dad for Father's Dad. His and my idea combined. And I simply can't wait to see this again......or King vs. King when Kong shows up to battle Godzilla next year. THAT will be another edge of my seat experience.***Final thoughts: Talk about Easter Eggs!! They're practically begging me to actually do that 35-movie marathon with how much they crammed in here for homage to the franchise. The post-credit scene alone is jam-packed with many interesting things to see/read, but it all goes fast. I was already going to buy this on Blu when it comes out, but now it's a must just so I can pause it to absorb more of the movie's radiation...of goodies!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","bobbywell","3 June 2019","Spoilers forthcoming....
I went to this movie to get away from family drama. Not have insane amounts.
First good things:
Godzilla and the monsters ROCK.
Glowing red meltdown Godzilla: WOW!!
Ken Watanabe... great.
Supporting cast: solid. I liked all of the non-main characters, even if they were never fleshed out.
The Russell family sucked. Why was this put in there? To make us want the monsters kill them?
First: mom brings daughter to a top secret monster research lab.
Two: mom ( supposedly a scientist) breaks quarantine to test a prototype.
Three: mom colludes with terrorists kills all her coworkers and 10s of thousands perhaps millions is people.
Daughter of course knows how to do everything and thwarts plot. Who wrote this crap???Conclusion: watch the movie. If you are in a theater go get snacks or use the restroom when the Russell family appears. If you are at home FF through them. You will enjoy it much better.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","filipemanuelneto","2 March 2020","This film is the predictable sequel to ""Godzilla"", with the appearance of a legion of monstrous creatures called Titans. I liked, in general, the 2014 film, and I went to see this film with some interest, believing that finally Godzilla was having a more interesting treatment from the cinema. And I confess that I am not disappointed, as the film is even better than its predecessor in some important points.The film takes the point where the previous one ended and reveals to us the efforts made since then, to create a way of understanding and reproducing the vocalizations of the monsters already awake. It is with this technology that Emma Russell, allied with a group of mercenaries, tries to wake up the sleeping monsters that Monarch monitors. She thinks it will restore a natural balance in the world, perhaps through a massacre. I confess that I found this part of the script somewhat confusing. Against her is ex-husband Mark, who argues that all monsters should simply be killed or left to sleep. It doesn't matter; the fact is that they wake up the only one who should have been left to sleep: the Guidorah hydra, the only one that has the capacity to wake everyone up and control them to slaughter Humanity. It is now up to Godzilla and her fellow humans to contain this threat, even if it means the partial destruction of the world.As in the previous film, there are good and bad things in this story. It's a little hard to believe that creatures like that would spend thousands of years sleeping without being detected by curious humans. On the other hand, the film makes good use of material from classic legends involving monsters (Scylla, Kong, the Loch Ness Monster, Hydra and others). I was not convinced by the supposed alien origins of Hydra, I think it is a little credible detail of the script. There is also a time when everyone seems to stumble over Atlantic civilization, but that is never even mentioned.The cast's work is more enjoyable in this film than in its predecessor. For a start, I felt that there were more possibilities to connect with the characters. This bet made the film gain more interest as we feel more involved in the action and care more about what happens. Godzilla, in this respect, is a character in his own right. Among the human cast I would positively highlight Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga. Both do a good job, even though the character of Farmiga is very difficult to understand and unworthy of our sympathy. Watanabe continues to maintain the good performance that started in the previous film, ending it brilliantly. I don't know if all the merit belongs to the actor or if the screenwriter also reserved better material for the actor, but the truth is that it worked very well. Bradley Whitford, Aisha Hinds, Ziyi Zhang and Sally Hawkins do a good job of support. Millie Bobby Brown is almost left in the film and has little to do but be in danger when the script needs an extra reason for the characters to move faster.The film maintained the good production values of its predecessor. And there is no doubt that there is a lot of money invested. A grandiose and impressive CGI, with scenarios of pure destruction everywhere, the bet on a more luminous environment, which allows the public to better see the destruction of the world and the epic battles that are fought among the human ruins. Now we see better what the first film kept wrapped in dust and shadows. The monstrous creatures also seem to me better worked and realistic. We also have impressive sound and visual effects, good post-production work, with excellent mixing and editing, well-crafted special effects, good sets, costumes and props.Overall, it is a satisfying action and sci-fi film, with a somewhat elaborate story that works well if we don't think about it too much. You can pass the time, although it is not a work of cinema art. Godzilla will certainly continue to be a recurring monster in cinema, even though it does not give rise to really good films.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","mjl1966","20 January 2022","A classic - even if appropriated - return to Godzilla as a cultural icon of Japan's national catharsis in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The first clue is a nod to the genesis of Godzilla in the naming of Monarch's primary base Castle Bravo - that fateful and disastrous nuclear weapons test from 1954. Godzilla was, indeed, born in the shadow of nuclear fire. As Dr. Serizawa says: ""Sometimes, the only way to heal our wounds is to make peace with the demons who created them."" That line right there is worth the wait.But it takes the movie a minute to get there. The first act is convoluted, confusing and disjointed with an over-accelerated pace of plot development that may leave you adrift at first. But once it gets on point, the story unfolds to reveal the classic Japanese tale of heroic sacrifice that is Godzilla.Brutal and poignant, I found the King of Monsters to be the most heartfelt of the modern big-budget Godzilla movies. Even if they mis-stepped on the front end and you have to side-step a few OTN references to the evils of mankind, the crew behind this movie pull it together once Godzilla shows up. It ends much stronger than it begins, and I think it's worth hanging in there to get the powerful payoff. Dr. Serizawa is your spiritual guide in this episode, with an almost fourth-wall breaking acknowledgement of skepticism and cynicism by several other members of the cast. The writers lampshade the incredulity of Godzilla's spiritual prowess a bit too much, but still give the spiritual story behind the monster everything they've got. Almost as if to say, ""We know some of you think this is trite. We don't care. We're going to do it anyway."" You have to approach this movie (like any Godzilla movie) with the spirit of attending a magic show. It only works if you let it. For my part, I found it quite moving.Long live the King.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","redcanofevil","3 June 2019","GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS (2019) :Lets start with a history lesson as it's crucial to understand what a Godzilla movie is. The Japanese created Gojira as a means of sneaking socio-political allegories in their movies and then the Americans took over, made the name Godzilla a household name and started doing larger than life monster movies. It was basically created as a B-movie where people wore latex suits to look like monsters and punch each other on set. So what does the new Godzilla do? It follows both its Japanese and American roots by creating a massive monster flick with deep seeded social allegories.I don't go to a Godzilla movie expecting an Oscar-bait and neither should the critics responsible for its low score. It was clearly made for fans who loved and stayed with Godzilla all their life and I dare say it's the best one yet.The two biggest downsides to this movie are ice thin plot and even thinner script. The plot is not necessarily bad but mainly serves as a breather for the next action sequence. The main intention of the ""bad guy"" is undoubtedly the worst motivation and reasoning I've seen in a movie. But once that is out of the way the plot progression is relatively passable. The story basically circulates around a device created by the scientist played by Vera Farmiga (I think she's called Emma, I didn't care and kinda forgot) and her dumb reasoning and approach to awaken the Titans and destroy a portion of humanity in order to ensure sustenance of the rest. And if that sounds familiar then congratulations you've seen Infinity War where it came off less sadistically and goofy than in here.As for the script, well there isn't one. I can bet the director walked in and said, ""Listen guys, it's a Godzilla movie and no one cares about the humans. So just say whatever pops in your head and we'll run with it"". And that is exactly what happened or if that isn't the case, they should fire whoever wrote it.As we all know, a bad script brings forth bad acting and there are a few. Well I wouldn't call it bad but it surely was lackluster. Ken Watanabe yet again wasted in a movie but I'll let it slide as he was responsible for a very awesome scene which I won't spoil. Thomas Middleditch was there doing usual Thomas Middleditch stuffs and Kyle Chandler seemed to be talking to a wall at one scene and his character felt like a ""know-it-all"" snob and was unbearable for the most part. Bradley Whitford mainly carried on with the jokes and Sally Hawkins did absolutely nothing. Vera Farmiga seemed like she was still in the Conjuring set and provided nothing out of the ordinary. The only decent performance came from the oldest and the youngest of the cast. Charles Dance was as threatening as he was as Tywin and did the best with what he was given. Millie Bobby Brown was given to be the damsel in distress and she actually did a fantastic job.Now that we've dropped off the cheap script, subpar acting and a plot as thin as it can be, let's take a look at why it is the best Godzilla movie ever made. The visuals were just jaw dropping and some of the shots in the film were absolutely sublime. The use of color to mark creatures was extraordinary and highly appreciable. The cinematography for the most part was solid aside from a few close-up shots but those were very few and far between. The monster designs were hands down the best I've seen and their scales were appropriately huge. Mothra looked absolutely beautiful and Ghidora retained its serpentine traits.The scale of this movie has to be mentioned as that is what drew me towards it. The sheer size and volume of each titan was a sight to behold as were the trails of destruction that followed. Words can't explain how much I loved the massive scales of everything.The fight sequences were truly fantastic and are a worthwhile. You can never go wrong with big monsters fighting each other in a half destroyed city and this movie cements that case. And this is the first Godzilla movie that offers more than a fair share of monster brawls and that too with gorgeous visuals with technical mastery. All my life I waited for a Godzilla movie that had each of the aforementioned elements and with Godzilla: King of Monsters I've finally found it.The movie contains its fair share of Titans although I was expecting some more fan favorite ones. Luckily a few of them were teased and although I wouldn't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet but let me just say two words: ""Oxygen Destroyer"". If you get the reference I'm sure you're just as excited for what's to come just like me.The movie pays proper homage to Japanese classics and even managed to play a variation of the core monster theme songs. The sound mixing was pure bliss as was the score in general. The classic Godzilla scream and the heavenly Mothra noise are all there as is their themes. They even teased the Mothra fairies in a way and I can't believe they actually made it work without coming off as super goofy.
In all fairness Godzilla: King of the monsters is a movie I've been waiting and wanting to see ever since I first saw the animated show and later got reacquainted with the Japanese classics. If you want to get the essence of a Godzilla movie, its lore and just basic monster on monster action in a grand scale with masterful visuals; this is the movie for you. This is a Godzilla movie done right and I have no problem saying I was satisfied for the most part. The rating might be off-putting to many but I loved what I saw and have been waiting for a movie like this for a very long time","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","nikola17","3 June 2019","This is Godzilla film i wanted to see this sequel proof's the first 2014 Godzilla film I have always liked Godzilla film franchise film saga of all time, when 2014 film reboot comeback the Godzilla 2014 the trailer made it look like intense and wanna see film but when you see it, it's boring as hell because you don't see Godzilla until like first 40 or 45 minutes of movie when the film goes for 2 hour long film something minutes he is less in it and human actors in first film are more in it like 97% of film how does people like first (2014) Godzilla when he is not much in it like 8% ? i don't get it at all ? this is full on going this shows Godzilla much more then first film does it's slow burn plus i wasn't much fan of first film but if your not fan of first Godzilla (2014) film then you will like this sequel a lot 10 times better then this film. look you may think it's 2 hour long boring movie of all time it's not. it's on going full on Godzilla kicking the crapout of another monsters and battling each another having all monsters kicking each another out that's how the fans wanted that's i wanted the first Godzilla to be like but no when the first scene where Muto shows up at airport and Godzilla they start fighting then scene cuts to kid watching on TV. in this sequel nope this sequel proof's everything wrong against the first 2014 Godzilla. the story the characters was a lot better but mostly entire movie it shows Godzilla, Rodan, Ghidorah mostly destroying rampaging everything in entire film. i loved special effects of this movie with blue and white effects, nice colors of it. love new upgrade from Godzilla is blowing out blue thunder out that's sick, nice color for film and poster as well it's beautiful. I actually like the human cast liked O'Shea Jackson Jr aka ice cube son he did a great job in this movie if he was lead it would be another version movie franchise of Pacific Rim Uprising, Independence resurgence. he would been great lead role but he was part of this movie. Kyle Chandler did fine he is a least better lead then to Aaron Taylor Johnson witch i didn't like him in this movie because he was boring as hell him as series actor with boring.story does follow up ending of 2014 Godzilla and it doesn't explain anything of characters from first film that's great i don't want to see them at all and i don't care for them. the start of film takes place from ending of film shows Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) was looking for his daughter Madison Russell
(Millie Bobby Brown) and his wife Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) after the disatar where the fight was over when Godzilla fighting Muto then story continues after 2014 film ended, it has villain (Charles Dance) witch he did good in film as villain, the main characters are more interesting then in first film the family Mark Russell i wish he could been played solider in first Godzilla film but he is a Emma's ex-husband, Madison's father, an animal behavior and communication specialist who formerly worked for Monarch, and co-inventor of ""the Orca"", a machine that enables communication with the Titans but can also ""potentially control them using their bioacoustics on a sonar level. After suffering a loss, Mark has an unfavorable opinion of the Titans, Godzilla in particular. Despite this, he joins a rescue mission along with Dr. Serizawa and Dr. Graham to save Emma and Madison from nefarious forces. his acting is pretty emotional he wants all creatures to die to be destroyed but people say Godzilla is not invasion of world he is their to save world, to kill the another creatures, the wife about her character is a ark's ex-wife, Madison's mother, a paleobiologist working for Monarch with a history of environmental activism, and co-inventor of the Orca. Unlike Mark, Emma believes that humans and Titans can co-exist peacefully. she is forced to do things that aren't her faultbecause she is forced to do a lot of things that are unexpected but she doesn't have choice by Charles Dance character A former British Army colonel and MI-6 agent who defected after becoming disillusioned by humanity during his time in the service but then he becomes a band of accomplice mercenaries. i thought those characters had a interesting thing in movie then in first film with characters that we cared for expect for Bryan Cranston character in first film. but i wished he was lead role for this movie of first film or this sequel but sadly it had to kill him off for no reason. They play a good supporting cast to the main cast you care about The Titans, but in my opinion i loved O Shea Jackson character in this movie the best when he plays a soldier in film.in film it shows entire more then human characters is they show monster verse that leaves you loud at theater and it shows more fighting and a epic cool looking showdown battling each another not just that it has great special effects, cool coloring looking, great CGI looks it was great and better and kicks the crap out of first film. Not totally sure why people are coming out of seeing the film with the 'it's not what I expected' attitude, they loved 2014 Godzilla
75% of rotten tomatoes ???? and it got that higher but this can't ? this got 39%
for no reason ? what was bad about this movie ? it didn't had much story ? it had too much great better CGI, it had full on kicking ass action and it shows Godzilla fully in this movie it shows Godzilla and monsters more then human characters, this is called a REAL GODZILLA movie when he is in it. not like in 2014 Godzilla where it shows Godzilla in 10 seconds and then scene cuts way to kid watching it on TV ? the film didn't saw Godzilla in 45 minutes until the end of film i wanted to see more of Godzilla and this is what i get i loved what i got. i don't know what people want from this movie what ? more characters then to less Godzilla ? that's freaking sad theirs no Godzilla in film, their are no presents in it. It's Godzilla, it's based on the King of monsters fighting to keep the title literally, but not literally, but he does more in this movie a lot more.
If your a Godzilla fan you will love this film more much more then the first film this shown Godzilla a lot more and he does a lot more then first film, give a sequel a try. Where Godzilla 2014 failed this movie and it stil got a succeed this is why you don't listen and pay attention to critics who knows what they want they wanna a Godzilla film they loved 2014 film when theirs no Godzilla and didn't do much in this movie and it doesn't show him until 45 minutes the movie is called Godzilla that's all it's called it should more Godzilla and more of him in it kicking ass nope it shows less Godzilla and more characters got great dumb success. believe me this is more of Godzilla kicking ass, this is more of his movie then to any of it and shows more of monsters more then first Godzilla.make sure Make sure you stay till the VERY end of the credits scene or for a final scene hinting at what ? could be to come. i have Walked out with a smile on my face after watching this movie then to 2014 Godzilla witch made say could of been better.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Bertaut","14 June 2019","I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards's Godzilla (2014). Sure, there were plot holes through which you could drive an entire fleet of trains carrying nuclear weapons, it featured coincidences that stretched believability even by Hollywood's standards, the human characters were paper thin, and it took itself very, very seriously. But I enjoyed it. Ironically enough though, what I admired most is the same thing that a lot of people disliked - the fact that Edwards kept Godzilla's appearances so fleeting. Personally, I thought it was a masterclass in directorial restraint, and it had the effect that when the big final fight came, it hit home on so many levels because here, finally, we were getting to see the big guy throw down. However, I understand why some people were unimpressed that a film called Godzilla featured so little, well, Godzilla!The third film in Legendary Entertainment's ""MonsterVerse"" franchise, King of the Monsters is a direct sequel to Edwards's film (although sadly, he didn't return as director), and sets up Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), which is scheduled for release next summer. However, whereas Edwards held Godzilla back and made the action feel smaller by focalising it through the human characters, new director Michael Dougherty essentially inverts that formula, putting Godzilla front and centre and shooting the action in such a way as to make it seem as grandiose as possible. He isn't half the director that Edwards is, but King of the Monsters works well in a braindead summer action movie that's wall-to-wall giant monsters fighting one another kind of way. Sure, there are significant problems (all the best shots are in the trailer, the plot is beyond laughable, the characters are so thinly sketched as to make those in the first film feel Shakespearean, clichés abound, the talented cast is wasted), but all things considered, I enjoyed it, as it accomplished exactly what it set out to accomplish.Five years since Godzilla defeated the MUTOs, many more creatures (newly dubbed Titans) have been found throughout the world in various forms of hibernation. In charge of studying and protecting them is Monarch Sciences (introduced in a fledgeling state in Kong: Skull Island (2017), which took place in 1973). In China, Monarch paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) watch the awakening of the larval form of Mothra. However, when Mothra becomes distressed, Emma is able to calm it using the ORCA, a device which monitors the Titans' bioacoustics and transmits a dominant ""alpha signal"" capable of placating them. Soon thereafter, eco-terrorist Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his private army storm the facility, stealing the ORCA, and kidnapping Emma and Madison. In response, Monarch track down Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), Emma's estranged husband, and co-designer of the ORCA, hoping he might be able to help find Jonah. Mark and Emma lost a son in San Francisco during the fight between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and whereas Emma came to feel the Titans could help humanity, Mark became convinced they should all be eradicated. Meanwhile, Jonah heads to the Monarch facility in Antarctica, and unleashes the only non-terrestrial Titan, a fearsome three-headed dragon codenamed ""Monster Zero"", but whom ancient humans knew as King Ghidorah. Arguing that humanity has brought the planet to the point of destruction, Jonah believes that if the Titans are awoken, the ensuing conflict would wipe out most of human civilisation, allowing the planet the time it needs to heal. And so, with Ghidorah awakening the various Titans throughout the world, Godzilla emerges to stand against him.Godzilla was originally created by Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishirô Honda, and Eiji Tsuburaya in 1954 and was conceived as a metaphor for the destructive power of nuclear weaponry. King of the Monsters has one eye on its themes too (eco disaster, biodiversity, co-existence with other species, military impulsiveness, the insignificance of humanity compared to the vastness of nature), but really, the sermonising script by Dougherty and Zach Shields, from a story by Max Borenstein, is so badly put together, with the characters' motivations so poorly delineated, that any thematic concerns dissipate into nothing. Part of this is that the narrative simplifies Godzilla's 'morality'. In the 2014 version, Edwards muddied Godzilla's intentions brilliantly, depicting a monster that was fairly indifferent to humanity, and was far more concerned with the biological drive to reassert his alpha status. In King of the Monsters, both Godzilla and Mothra are fundamentally good, and wish to protect humanity from Ghidorah, which is more binary and not nearly as interesting a position to take.And yes, the film does address the fact that through inattention and greed, humanity is on the brink of ensuring its own extinction. The problem is that the script is so ham-fisted and poorly structured, the eco themes so preachy, and the organic integration of those themes into the action so lacking, that they come across as background irrelevancies at best, and distracting moralising at worst. And in any case, the film ultimately undermines all of this in favour of reaffirming the clichéd old notion of human perseverance in the face of adversity.There are other problems with the script, however. For example, not one, not two, but three characters sacrifice themselves for the greater good (all at different times), resulting in none of the sacrifices really meaning anything. Another scene that doesn't work is the death of a major character; it happens so suddenly, amidst so much chaos, with the camera on even focused on them, that in the very next scene, the film has to show us their face on a monitor with the word ""Deceased"" written underneath. The character of Mark is also peculiarly written. Played by the top-billed Chandler, he has little to do for most of the film other than look at monitors with a concerned expression, coming off more as a fed-up dad than the protagonist of a Kaiju film. There are also far too many scenes of characters standing on the bridge of the Monarch flagship, the ARGO, spouting expositional word-dumps at one another. And not a single character in the film comes across as three-dimensional.There are also some hilarious spatial hijinks going on. I get that the ARGO is supposed to be a super-advanced high-tech mobile fortress, but it seems capable of flying from one side of the planet to the other in about ten minutes, and unless it's capable of transportation, there's some Game of Thrones-level compression of distances going on. Another problem is the twins played by Ziyi Zhang. Except I didn't even realise there were two of them until I read a few reviews. Sure, I noticed what I thought was a singular character appear to be in two places at once, but because the ARGO had already been globe-hopping all over the place by that point, I just put it down to the film's lack of geographic realism. The fact that it's so easy to miss that there are twins is spectacularly bad writing, especially considering they're supposed to be a modernised version of the Shobijin. And don't get too excited about seeing a Titan battle-royal. Apart from the central tag-teams of Godzilla and Mothra facing off against Ghidorah and Rodan, most of the rest (including those newly created for the film) are seen only in news reports and a montage that plays behind the closing credits, although a few do turn up for one scene.But for all that, however, I thoroughly enjoyed King of the Monsters. Although the trailer did promise what the film can't deliver on (Claude Debussy and pensive apocalypticism), aesthetically, there's a lot to admire. Erik Aadahl, Brandon Jones, and Tim Walston's sound design is suitably deafening, and Lawrence Sher's cinematography has a well-judged sense of scale, especially in the 2.39:1 3D IMAX format. This is complemented by Roger Barton, Bob Ducsay, and Richard Pearson's editing, which maintains the rhythm of even the most chaotic action scenes. The film also does some interesting things with colour. Whereas the palette is predominantly mixed when we're with the human characters, the Titans are coded in binary elemental colours: Mothra glows blue as a larva and gold in her final form, Rodan reflects the hardened red of the lava from which he emerges, Godzilla is the green of nature, Ghidorah is a neutralising dark brown. There are also some extraordinary individual shots (most of which have unfortunately been spoiled by the trailer); Mothra spreading her wings for the first time, Ghidorah perched atop an erupting volcano with a crucifix looming in the foreground, the reveal of Godzilla's lair. And the final shot is a goosebumps moment with which no Kaiju fan could possibly be dissatisfied. Purely at the level of craft, this is a hugely impressive film.Citizen Kane (1941) it most certainly isn't, but who expected (or wanted) it to be. The key to really parsing the film is to consider the context, looking at what it was trying to be. And in this sense, it's a success. Sure, the script is hideous, and Dougherty is no Edwards, struggling to accomplish what Edwards seemed to do with ease; bring his own personality to the spectacle. However, if you approach it for what it is, a dumb summer blockbuster about large monsters punching each other, you'll like it just fine.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","0w0","28 August 2019","I don't mind a plot-hole or two, but when the characters in a movie are blatantly stupid or massively incompetent, THAT'S when I stop taking a movie seriously. I won't spoil the movie, but the characters in this movie have MULTIPLE chances throughout the movie to remedy a bad situation, and yet they simply don't do it... It's like when the 'good guy' is face-to-face with the 'bad guy' and then they simply refuse to shoot the 'bad guy' in the face, due to some existential crisis (or just due to a horribly written script)... well that happens multiple times in this movie. The CGI in certain scenes are also sub-par (though most scenes are fine)... they probably used multiple different CGI-studios on the movie, and that's why some CGI scenes look worse than others. Overall, it's a pretty pointless movie... why even make a sequel when it's going to be far inferior to the other movies in the franchise? Corporate greed, that's why...","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","doorsscorpywag","27 July 2019","People just stand watching monsters emerge only running away after a long drawn out pause for effect and a cool scene by which time it's too late..
Planes and choppers need to get within ten feet of monsters to fire missiles instead of doing it from 1000 yards or more. This results in more cool scenes where all the attacking planes get destroyed.Why all this is under the direction of the US makes no sense. We at one point are in Mexico but their army must be off building a wall as it is America 'saving' the townspeople.The 'plot' (and I use the term loosely) revolves around Millie Bobby Browns mother who with Charles Dance wants to save the world by destroying most of mankind because we are a plague on the planet. Of course they themselves are not volunteering to get killed and would form some kind of military/scientific elite once the monsters are finished killing a huge swathe of the population.Obviously it goes awry as events get out of control.
This monstrous woman who has the blood of tens of millions on her is given a chance to heroically redeem herself at the end instead of dying the horrible death she deserved.Millie Bobby Brown's character is somehow indestructible as at one stage she is hit by a huge slab of concrete which bounces off her head. She happily stands inside Fenway Park as all hell breaks out around here but miraculously survives it all.Acting is poor and the monsters not that great either. Most of the action happens after dark so they don't have to spend too much on CGI.Basically it is garbage. Not as bad as the 90s one, or the first one but still utter nonsense.If you want to see what Godzilla should be watch Shin Godzilla in its original Japanese language with subtitles. The dubbed version not as good.","

For one, the absence of Elizabeth Olsen and her husband is palpable. The movie is a good look at the core values of Godzilla movies- man versus nature. The acting and special effects are good. The story, itself, is the weakest aspect of this movie. Ken Wantanabe could say anything in any role and sound believable-he is good in this. Mille Bobby Brown and Vera Farmiga are good. The strength of the movie is Godzilla and Mother. They harken back to the origins of why people fell in love with these films.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","charliegeeza","3 June 2019","I have balanced my rating between what I, as a skeptical adult with high standards, and my son aged 7 would have given it. He gives it a 10/10 and absolutely adored it. I give it a 6/10 because, whilst the monsters were pretty spectacular and certain moments in the film fairly wonderous, it was a bit messy and had some aspects that I felt really let it down.As a father, I was disappointed with the inclusion of rude language. Hollywood seems to have long since decided that sh-- is not a bad word when it is not something most parents want in the ears of their kids. The when the f--- word was dropped I was pretty annoyed. It added absolutely nothing to the film, it was completely unnecessary and the film makers surely had to know this film would appeal to kids. It's a film about giant monsters! There was little to no blood in the film too.That aside, most of the humour fell completely flat. I don't know anybody who thought the Gonorrhea joke was funny so was baffled that they included it. Just cut that line out the scene and the film is better for it. I can only think that it was a pet idea of the director so was kept in the final cut.There were several tropes that just weren't required and served as annoyances. At one point they exit a plane with the first couple of soldiers being vapourized instantly. I guess it is intended to inject DDay-like battle anxiety in the viewer but it doesn't work at all - firstly there's not enough build up of the emotions the soldiers are experiencing as they arrive at the scene facing almost inevitable doom, in fact they completely gloss over the absolute fear everybody should be experiencing, and secondly because those vapourized soldiers are green screened into the shot we have no reactions at all from the protagonists.The monsters frankly moved too quickly at times, especially during fight scenes. It detracted from the sense of scale. It was a problem not present in the 2014 Godzilla where the movement was very well judged. There's also a moment in the film where something happens to one of the monsters that is passed off as 'not part of the natural order' but, again, the speed at which it transpires was just far too quick.There were also several bizarre time and space jumps. Often location changes seemed to involve traveling ridiculous distances in nonsensical times. There's a certain moment in the film when several monsters show up that would have required them to travel half way around the globe in just a few hours.What they really nailed right in this film, which they got badly wrong in the 2014 film, was the perspective changes during the monster battles. In the 2014 film it was almost entirely from the perspective of people on the ground, which meant you rarely understood what was going on in the fights between the monsters. In King of Monsters the perspective is shared between a proper action camera and the perspective of the protagonists on the ground.By far the most interesting point of the film was when they go in search of Godzilla, leading to the only really adventurous period of the film, culminating in a moment that should have been quite emotional as a character volunteers for a suicide mission, but I found myself not caring due to the failure to properly build the characters in the film, which was a shame.Why do I write all these criticisms? Probably because I felt this film could have been a classic. Instead it is a competent monster action film with a better story than the 2014 film but a sub par script and characters (no fault of the actors IMHO).","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","AdrenalinDragon","29 May 2019","After coming out of seeing Godzilla: King of the Monsters, I was very happy with the final outcome. Not sure what people were expecting outside of big Kaiju monster action sequences. The Godzilla movies have never been the highlight in terms of the story side of things. I didn't think the Human characters were as godawful as everyone was making them out to be. They had motivations and character arcs. Sure, some of them went into cliche and predictable paths, but I don't think it's weak enough to really hurt the film that much to me. Some characters from the previous 2014 Godzilla movie reappear in this movie, and I feel they do a better job here and are used more effectively. The pacing is also better in this movie and nothing feels too dragged out as far as I'm concerned.All I wanted most were big monster smash action sequences and this Godzilla
delivers that for about 2/3rds of the movie's running time. They are really
well shot and the CGI to me was fantastic, especially in IMAX 3D. The sound was booming and loud, and there's not really much I could fault on the technical side of this movie. It's a popcorn blockbuster action movie, and I think it's a pretty damn good one for what it is. No idea why the critics disliked this one so much compared to that snoozefest Godzilla 2014. My god that movie was so boring and Godzilla was only in it for like what 5 minutes? You get all the missing action everybody wanted here, and these iconic monsters battling such as King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan, and Godzilla himself. If you judge it for what it is, a huge modern Godzilla movie, it does a pretty good job at achieving that goal.8/10","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","FairlyAnonymous","3 June 2019","I want to thank all of the visual effects artists, animators, riggers, lighters, concept artists, story-artists and what not for being able to pull this off. Sure, the movie has some fairly big issues in terms of story, but never in my life did I imagine that I would see these iconic kaiju on the big-screen.""King Ghidorah in theatres? Nah, that would never happen."" I thought for many years.But here it is and every moment with the kaiju is brilliant. There was never a second where I didn't enjoy a kaiju fighting, growling, roaring, flying, or anything. A lot of care has been put into this movie's monsters to make sure they feel authentic to the original, but also ferociously updated.That being said, is it a flawless film?Far from it. There are some pacing issues (I think the movie is about 25 minutes too long), a lot of exposition, unfunny side-characters who constantly need to butt-in and make self-aware jokes and references that completely ruin certain moments, and a very poorly motivated villain.The villain actually irks me a bit not because their plan doesn't make sense, but because the movie makes them super evil but then later on tries to back-track on that element and make them seem like a nice person who we should care about. This villain is single-handedly responsible for killing about a billion people or more and yet the movie treats them like an average character who is just ""morally confused"". The movie even attempts to give them a ""heroic"" death, but there were many people in the theater shouting ""just let them die!"" ""Thank goodness they are finally dead!"" and other such things.All that being said, I still enjoyed the movie. It certainly understands what makes Godzilla movies entertaining and there was definitely a lot of passion put into this project. I just wish that one of these days we could get a Godzilla movie with both interesting characters and great fight sequences.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ZCDomingos","16 August 2019","I'm going to be honest, I love this movie, truly, but it's not flawless. On this chapter we got what we wanted, the true fight between alphas and the conquest of the true power over everything. And even though some people complaint about the human factor of this movie, I actually enjoyed it...until some degree.In these type of movies, either we get full monster fight or full human war with some glimpses of the monster. This movie is one of few that manages to balance these distinct perspectives.
Which side should we be on, that one that protects these monsters, the one that wants to kill them, the one that wants to weaponize them?! It's really interesting to me, and such an appeal and well balanced as we get to observe these monsters.That said, I can't say it's totally original. This human vs monsters has been done before, so it really needed to bring some fresh topics to distinguish from other movies, the plot revolving the mother was totally cliché, the ""I want to save the planet, so I'll join the the villain side, but the villain turned out to be using me and fooled me the whole time"" has been done so many times and it didn't bring a new perspective or a fresh take on the plot, specially with her sacrifice in the end...cliché from start to the end.Overall I was satisfied with this chapter, and can't wait to see what's to come","

Made me want to watch the 2014 one again.Full review:This movie had a surprising amount of heart. There was way more emotional intensity than I expected. And I think they actually did a pretty good job at creating a world with mythology and back story.But... I came here to see 200 million dollars worth of monsters fighting and destroying things!Alas, near the end, the constant stopping of the action to pour on more human drama got to be a little too much for me, and unfortunately I found myself feeling a little bored right when this movie's ""Godzilla surprise"" hit.It's almost like they went out to design some REALLY iconic images -- ones that'd make awesome posters -- then figured out how to wrap some fight scenes around them.It gets super-confusing when you consider the distances traveled and the amount of time taken, and the length of some scenes going from day to night to day again rapidly ... but, anyone looking for ""realistic"" or ""remotely plausible"" clearly shouldn't be going to a Godzilla movie.I don't have the slightest clue how Kong could possibly beat this guy, but we'll have to wait and see.Overall, I enjoyed the 2014 movie quite a bit more than this one -- the ""boring human parts"" did a much better job of staying out of the way and letting the real star shine.Still, I would recommend it.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Akito_Kinomoto","8 June 2019","Four monsters, two hours, one planet, a lot of fight scenes. I won't blame anyone for jumping at the chance to see this film, and it does deliver exactly what it advertises. That would normally set the right mindset for an experience like this. Unfortunately, the movie is both painfully straightforward while subverting expectations in a highly unsatisfying fashion. But instead of making another joke at The Last Jedi's expense, let's look at Godzilla: King of the MonstersGodzilla: King of the Monsters stars Raymond Burr as reporter Steve Martin, as he investigates sightings of a behemoth that has attacked ships off the coast of JapanWait, that's the wrong movieGodzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) is about ancient monsters awakening around the world, while the military and an organization known as Monarch try to handle the damage caused by these giant animals. As the enormous creatures start vying for supremacy against each other, humanity finds itself in the crossfire as the planet's largest battle for dominance is reignitedOr at least, this is what the story attempts, but ""attempts"" might be too generous. To say the movie crashes while flying its premise would imply it took off the ground at some point, but even three aerial monsters in the film didn't let it happen. The earliest sign of trouble with this story appears when the first of these titans rears its head and its features are barely noticeableThe decision to obscure these giant animals unfortunately extends to the territory battles between them. The fights are spaced far apart enough to not overwhelm the audience, but frequent enough to continue the thunderous footsteps. Unfortunately, on top of the behemoths being obscured by rain, snow, clouds, or smoke, the ""camera"" work involved with these CGI creations is close and chaotic to the point of being nearly indiscernible. There's rarely a steady point of reference to sell the size of these titans, and the ""color"" filter with their scenes only serves to hide them further even in plain sightWhat stands out the most about these monsters is the sound design, both the roaring movements and their musical motifs. The roars of the giant animals are excellently powerful, frantic, majestic, and threatening to match the titan. The vibrations of the tremors and trails from the wake of these behemoths emphasize their size and being where the visual framing does not. But by far the audio highlight in the best way possible are the creature's themes. Beautifully crafted masterpieces that invoke a sense of history from these ancient beings, while constructing a mythology and presence to reflect the nature of these leviathans. The extraordinary amount of care in this score is absolutely haunting, and by far the best part of the movieIt makes it all the more confusing that the film doesn't shut up. The fight scenes are spread out, but most of the space between them is intent on using loud tracks even when nothing cinematic is happening. Here would be a great time for the movie to let the audience catch its breath after its taken it away. It doesn't give time for the spectacle to settle, not for the frequency of the setpieces, but for the barely noticeable difference in ""volume"" between downtime and destruction time. The film wants to retain the viewer's excitement when the monsters are not on-screen (if they were even visible in the first place), but instead comes across as auditory hijacking. It overcompensates for itself and comes across as lacking confidence because of itThe most damning thing of all, however, are the human characters. If the monsters' presence is bombarded by inconsistent audiovisuals, then it's left in a heap by the infuriating human characters, and not because of military firepower either. Amidst the miscellaneous soldiers and scientists running about the story, are three thruline characters throughout the plot. One lacks purpose and personality in favor of being an audience surrogate. One is hyper-competent to a degree so as to nearly invalidate everyone else. One displays motivations that make less than no sense. And all of them are connected by tragedy via destruction from these behemothsThe dramatic thrust shared by these three characters is decimated by how poorly written they are. This is not okay. In 1954, there was a monster movie which had characters genuinely fearful both of the monster, and the consequences of what may happen should they take a certain step to destroy that monster. In 1989, there was a monster movie where a scientist was desperate to bring his deceased daughter back to life, only for it to backfire horribly. In 2004, there was a monster movie where the main hero's journey paralleled that of a monster fighting against an alien invasionThose films are Gojira, Godzilla vs Biollante, and Godzilla: Final Wars. They are different in tone from one another, but share in common a strong enough human element that contextualizes the sweeping spectacle of 50 meter, 80 meter, or 100 meter tall titans. Without that human anchor, action scenes featuring these giant animals can only carry a film so far before becoming boring. Not cheesy. Boring. This is even assuming the set pieces are compelling on their own in the first placeThis movie hurts. Even if the human characters were unremarkable, there's a baseline here that should have been highly entertaining for two hours. But not only are the human characters just milquetoast, they are aggressively aggravating. And the creature spectacle itself becomes tiring because of how haphazardly it's crafted. This film isn't painful because it could have been great, it hurts because there's a lot of care undermined by incompetence. It knows how to pace itself for breathers but doesn't let its downtime do what it needs to. It would have masterful sound design if it didn't insist on being loud all the time to the point certain music pieces can't shine through. The monsters themselves look great when they're not obstructed from view, while the roars and sounds from these giant animals project a lot of personalityThis film should have been an atomic blast but was instead a nuclear meltdown. After the studio behind this movie released two very solid monster films in 2014 and 2017, what should have been a three-peat didn't happen. The expectations on this movie weren't even the highest, because the monster films from 2014 and 2017 still had noticeable flaws themselves. Even carrying that tempered anticipation, this movie still hurts. I don't drink, but maybe Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) would be a better time if I wasn't sober","

All the men follow what these few say, all notable reserved or weak and full of mistakes. Men are literally puppets who say lines designed to feed you the storyline because the script is so terrible. Hollyweird has lost its mind. Show, don't tell. That's what a good movie does. This crap tells you everything while wasting millions on CG.There are so many scientists yet they seemingly do nothing science-like.Why is L, or whatever the hell her name is, from stranger things in this movie? She's obviously been type cast for screaming and crying- that's why. That's pretty much all the person does the entire film.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","RNMorton","1 June 2019","I am a Godzilla-lover and also a movie purist. So there were moments watching this where I had some reservations. I'm going to pretty much skip that. The story was told via the new fad Transformer-style, that is, get a nice small set of characters, have all hell break loose without rhyme or reason, and just follow the characters. While I struggled with this more towards the beginning I got sucked in as we went along and enjoyed the good acting and also the very good special effects. The Big Guy was looking healthy and King G never more menacing. I thought the 15 year old playing the daughter was very good among several good performances. So forget the stupid frequently unexplained moments and just enjoy the ride. I gave a bonus style point for it not being too long, just the right length with no lull from beginning to end.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Woodyanders","3 June 2019","Director/co-writer Michael Dougherty totally hits it out of the ballpark with this simply spectacular edition to the long running Godzilla series: Not only does Dougherty keep the engrossing and exciting story hurtling along at a breathless brisk pace despite the lengthy two hour-plus running time, but he also stages the thrilling and fantastic monster fights with rip-roaring gusto, maintains a refreshingly serious tone throughout, and keeps the human drama stuff on an even keel from start to finish. Moreover, Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and especially King Ghidorah all look amazingly lifelike and certainly deliver the rousing mondo destructo and go-for-the-throat thingo-to-thingo goods something fierce. The cast is quite solid as well: Kyle Chandler makes for an engaging human hero, Vera Farmiga likewise does well as a conflicted scientist who has given up on the human race, and Millie Bobbi Brown elicits sympathy as the daughter caught between these two, plus there are sturdy contributions from Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford (pretty amusing as the token wisecracking comic relief guy), Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance (spot-on ruthless as the eco-terrorist human villain), Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. Popping up in nifty bits are David Strathairn, Joe Morton, and CCH Pounder. Bear McCreary's spirited score hits the stirring spot. The special effects are truly incredible and Lawrence Sher's striking widescreen cinematography provides a wondrous wealth of breathtaking visuals. But this is really the Big G and company's show. And boy do they ever come through like the champion monsters that they all are.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","AnonymousMouseMan","31 May 2019","I must say the action in this is wonderful, so much is going on, no hesitation. It starts off strong, but slowly we realize this movie is almost 100% propaganda movie straight from the media. The reason there is so much destruction is because humans deserve to all be eradicated like cancer because we ruined the environment and the titans restore the balance. But plot twist, the one titan they release isn't from Earth at all, he's a parasite of sorts.
All women are in charge of everything, army, navy, commanders, scientists, even to the titans like Mothra. Women make the big decisions with the exception of the end scene. Hollywood producers wrecked this by needing to put women first in a masculine role, it's unfortunate. I love Orange is the New Black, Handsmaid Tale, but women aren't going to run things like they do in this, it just doesn't fit it's so out of place and jarring you're like why is she in charge of this or that?Silly movie, all propaganda for climate change control and we should eliminate human beings and put women in charge.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","xecutionrecords","3 June 2019","Looking at some of the comments on here today it makes me think that the world really needs a bit of Titan Cleansing to rid us of some of the stupidity coming out of people's mouths. 'This Film was too loud'? (Err Monsters smashing things.. get it) 'Not Enough storyline with the humans'? (Err Monsters vs Monsters.. get it) next time if you are going in to a movie with uncertainty about what you are going to get may i suggest you watch the multiple trailers that dropped way before the film hits theatres & it's safe to say you might have chosen to go see Aladdin instead, cause Aladdin this ain't baby!
Godzilla KOTM is a love letter to Toho's classic monster franchise & is by far the best American version yet despite what some might say, Gareth Edwards 2014 movie had it's moments but was lacking those huge monster moments that it was crying out for, here Michael Dougherty (Obviously a super fan) knows exactly what you have come to see and delivers some truly breathtaking & beautiful shots, all filmed like a spectacular painting. There are nods everywhere to previous movies from the Mothra Twins, Music Cues, Movie Titles on banners, even certain battle moves are recreated all without men in suits so those who complain about cgi should check out now before you blow a fuse again! Their are moments of quiet, surprisingly quite a few jammed in amongst all the chaos, and although they serve only to get us from one battle to another, the underlying message of the movie is quite clear & well thought out, is it ridiculous? well yes of course, it's a movie with a giant moth & others of the like in so if you thought this was going to be grounded you are seriously deluded. But compared to previous Godzilla plots, it's a lot more coherent & serves the franchise well for future movies, it's a seed planter for sure. What i loved most about it outside of the beautiful monster designs & moments is it's huge amount of respect shown for past visions, Dougherty clears knows his Big G history and older fans will probably be bowled over by this as much as me, it's rare to see this in an American franchise movie but like the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Highlights are many, the Antartica Moment of King Ghidora's entrance was stunning and made me think & hope that Del Toro was watching and thinking about 'In The Mountains of Madness' again. Pretty much every scene with Mothra was just beautiful to look at (listen for the music cues here, fans of the big flappy one will love these moments) Her short battle with Rodan had some comedy in as well which again i loved, subtle & smart from the film makers always. My wife also pointed out the large amount of religious imagery in this film, their were crosses everywhere, usually somewhere around the big monster moments like when Ghidora is standing atop the mountain etc, again this goes well & fits fantastically in with the nature of the story being told. This is NOT just a big dumb monster movie, thought, care, attention have all been applied to it & if you are smart & know your Godzilla history you will be rewarded handsomely. Ultimately this is a movie for Adults who never grew up (yes like me) & children who just want to see something amazing unfold in front of their unschooled eyes. If you sadly are the type of adult who actually grew out of being able to smile, switch off, remember what it was like to be a child (delete where applicable) then this movie will probably not do anything for you, good news though, they make plenty of those movies for you so seek em out but do us all a favour & don't come on here & rant about it unless you have something objective or sensible to say (sorry, it was too loud just doesn't cut it) it's ok not to like something sure but just because it's not your type of movie doesn't mean it's not delivering what it's meant too. Reviewing a title should mean that, you talk about the movie objectively & judge it against movies of it's type, if you seriously though that the plot of this movie could ever be anything other than fantastical, your either a troll or just not paying attention whch means you should not be writing about it.
KOTM is not without flaws but those are so few in amongst all of the great that i have no doubts that this is a high bar for future film makers to rise above. Acting was good with what they had in their script, they did the best they could but seriously when your in a movie with 4+ Kaiju (& really good ones at that) you not going to be remembered that much in the foyer after.. sorry guys. A movie for fans of the Fantastic, the Mind Boggling & the Insane. A Movie for big kids & little ones to talk about for years after. A Gorgeous looking 2 hours of the ridiculous, thats everything i could have hoped for in a Godzilla movie. If you think that's being childish, good because i am in love with Movies like this. Long Live The King!!","

Now we may not have cared too much about the classic Godzilla (Gojira) humans when it came to how they behaved or what their character was ... but we get spoiled I reckon. So when we see a story that is quite far stretched we might be nit-picking. Still this has less of the ""fake"" drama than the previous one, even though the stakes are quite higher ... now bring on King Kong into the mix (who only gets mentioned by name, but does not appear in this one) ...","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ninjaboyballer","3 June 2019","Godzilla King of the monsters is overall a great Kaiju rumble with some decent human characters. The Visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning. Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah, and the rest of the Kaiju are all beautiful, with the CGI being too notch in this film. The action and music are also a really nice touch to this film. The fights were awesome and the music put into the movie makes it feel exciting and tense. The one of the complaints I have with this movie though is that the humans could have been developed a little more. Like I understood the mothers plan but the way she was doing it was just mad. The father was underdeveloped and the daughter was just in situations she should have not survived in. And don't get me wrong I love Millie Bobby Brown and all the actors who gave decent performances in this movie. Although I really liked that one scene with Ken Wannabe, that scene was really great.Overall, Godzilla King of the Monsters is a stunning monsters movie complete with great action and musical scores, but the humans could have more developed and fleshed out. And all I have to say about those credits: #GodzillaVsKong2020Final rating: 8.2/10","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","xamtaro","2 June 2019","The sequel to 2014's GODZILLA and third installment to Legendary Studio's ""Monsterverse"", is a non stop, edge of the seat thrill ride in the vein of classic worldwide disaster movies like INDEPENDENCE DAY. Building on feedback from the previous installment, director Michael Dougherty delivers a spectacular love letter to the entire 65 year old (as of this year) franchise. It is exciting, it is beautiful, tragic, grand, an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish.We start off in real-time 2019. In the years following Godzilla's battle which leveled San Francisco, the world is divided over the knowledge that more of these so called titans exist and that the organization""MONARCH"" desires to protect them despite the destruction they may cause. Amidst this chaotic backdrop, a MONARCH facility in China is raided by an eco terrorist cell who kidnaps scientist Emma Russell along with her daughter Madison, so as to use her invention called the ""orca""; a machine that is able to record and mimic the titans bioacoustics signals which they use to communicate with each other. Led by the enigmatic renegade Alan Jonah, the eco terrorists plan to use the orca to awaken the hibernating titans in hope that they will restore the earth to its former glory. But there is more to this plot than meets the eye. Meanwhile, MONARCH engages the help of Doctor Mark Russell, Emma's estranged husband, and co-inventor of the orca, to try and locate the stolen device, his kidnapped ex-wife and child.If it starts to sound like a human focused ""angry dad rescuing family"" kind of movie, rest assured it is not. Our giant monsters, the titans, they are not just the backdrop, they feature front and centre from the get go. The prize target of the terrorists plot is to awaken ""Ghidorah"", a three headed dragon who had been the basis of legends like the hydra. They hope for Ghidorah to establish dominance over the other titans and control them. Unfortunately, Ghidorah himself has other plans. With seemingly alien abilities and power beyond measure, the only titan that might stand a chance against the multi headed monstrosity, is Godzilla.From the very first on screen appearance of Mothra, to Ghidorah, to the bird-like Rodan, and of course Godzilla, the whole movie goes full throttle with its plot. There is never a dull moment as we follow Mark and the MONARCH scientists led by Dr Serizawa across the globe trying to prevent an end-of-the-world scenario. You could say that it moves so fast that there is hardly any breathing room. Plot developments and characters development happen simultaneously and it's easily to get lost in the details if you do not pay attention.At our story's core is a tale of a broken individuals dealing with loss at the expense of a loved one. The Russells were victims of the San Francisco Godzilla battle. Their loss drove Mark to drink and become abusive leading to his divorce with Emma who in turn buried herself into her work, all while Madison suffered the fallout. In their journey towards making peace with the past, we see two hurt and bitter individuals choose to put aside their differences for the sake of their child and the world. It is a simple plot thread but with a heartwarming message about family.The cast play their roles perfectly; especially Kyle Chandler as Mark Russell and Serizawa played by veteran actor Ken Watanabe. The latter's role in the story becomes even more poignant if you watch the first movie and read both prequel comics ""Godzilla Awakening"" and ""Godzilla Aftershock"", knowing more about his history and a his connection to both Godzilla and nuclear weapons.However, the ones I found the most memorable were the G-Team led by badass lady Colonel Diane Foster. They are side characters with minimal development but the situations they are called to deal with, suppressing a terrorist attack, evacuating a city, luring an enraged Rodan away from a populated area, they do all that with guts and a strict dedication to their duty. The best part of it all? The human element is sufficient and never overstays it's welcome.Equal focus is given to the star attraction themselves: the giant monsters. All do them, Mothra, Rodan, Ghidorah and Godzilla all feature cool redesigns that pay homage to their original looks while taking it to a whole new level of badass. Moving Pictures Company (MPC) has outdone themselves once again in the CGI department. Special mention goes to the performance capture used for Ghidorah and Godzilla. Their expressions showcase clear human-like emotions and traits. Their body language blending the actor's performance with animalistic like movements. This motion capture is truly the descendant of traditional rubber suit monster performances.And when the titans clash, the visuals and cinematography effectively convey the immense scale of their battles. Thanks to Director Michael Dougherty and cinematographer Lawrence Sher, the movie is spectacularly shot with dark apocalyptic visuals, heightening the surreal spectacle of these massive clashes. We are truly witnessing war among gods!Pulse pounding music by composer Bear McCreary reproduces many of the iconic tunes from past Godzilla movies while giving his own unique spin, with drums and chants, imbuing an almost operatic feel to the movie. This is easily his greatest work to date.From the music to the characters to the monsters themselves, everything! The passion and love of the genre coming from the cast and crew is evident in every minute of this film. It is great for Newcomers to the Godzilla franchise thanks to the simple story, memorable characters, decent actors, and tight script. It's great as a gateway into the Godzilla franchise. For long time fans, there are numerous Easter eggs, references, callbacks, and parallels to past films. See if you can recognise them all. All in all GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS distills everything cool about Godzilla into a single modern movie.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Aaron1375","26 June 2019","I enjoyed this film as it had incredible monster action and it was totally awesome watching Godzilla battle Gidorah on the big screen. That being said, the plot was not the best and with the exception of Ken Watanabe, the actors in this film really failed to make an impact. Still, I went to this film to see my first love as a young child, Godzilla, so I came away from this one satisfied for the most part. I would like to see this do better, but I can understand why people are staying away from it as some of the plot is just head scratching bad!The story, more Titans have been located and are being tracked as they are all in slumber for the most part. Prepare to hear Skull Island multiple times throughout this one as it wants us to know that Kong is the next Godzilla opponent. Well, a terrorist organization goes after the beasts in the hopes to destroy everyone because that is what will benefit the planet most. There is also a daughter and mother combination that I thought was a son and mother combo for a bit as the commercials she looked like a boy and their dad is an expert at nothing, but can fight and thank goodness the monsters fight because this story was not top notch.In this film, Godzilla's main opponent is Gidorah, which in itself is a head scratcher to me. We have a three headed dragon who spews lightening and comes from space and Godzilla's next opponent is a giant monkey...seems like a downgrade to me. Suffice to say, the next film I will be asking for a spoiler and that spoiler will be who wins, Kong or Godzilla. If it is Kong, not going. I had to put up with Kong inexplicably winning the first time, this time no, not getting my money if he wins which my guess he will because Hollywood will figure a monkey is more relatable or some crap!So, the monsters do a fine job or fighting and wrecking havoc. It was cool to see versions of Mothra, Rodan and Gidorah on the big screen and in a way that looks like they are destroying cities and not models of cities. Granted, I still like a number of Japanese Godzilla films more than this one. Next up for Godzilla, Kong and if Kong is the victor this film will not be next up for me!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","JohnDeSando","30 May 2019","""Sometimes I think this is Godzilla's world. We just live in it."" Chief Warrant Officer Barnes (O'Shea Jackson Jr)It's summer blockbuster world, and Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a hot mess of good intentions bubbling over with smoke and fog that keeps geeks from fully appreciating the original Japanese destroyers. It's been 5 years since the old boy terrorized Tokyo and San Francisco.The first act looks like writer/director Michael Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields are aiming at an intelligent theme about cooperation but end in the third act losing all intelligence as in most superhero films with explosions and mano-a-mano monster mashing.The scientists, mainly married but estranged Mark and Emma Russell (Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga), are the chief protagonist-connections with the monsters. She is onto something about tapping into the titans' (the identifier of the original monster/ rulers of the earth) audio frequency with an Orca machine to neutralize them and eventually fold them into a benign universe of cooperation with humans.Along with the crypto-zoological, multinational organization, Monarch, the Russells work to save the titans from governments bent on destroying them. Not bad, but in these essentially cheesy films, Godzilla has to breathe fire, and Mothra and Rodan destroy anything, and ultimately the bad boy with three heads, King Ghidorah, has to bite his enemies to death.In order to humanize the proceedings, Dougherty includes the usual tension between teen daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), and mother Emma, with Dad Mark in between. Because the monsters are threatening life as we know it, this familial squabbling is all the more ludicrous for its emphasis.In our culture, we have always written about dragons and gorgons, so in a way we are right at home with these ridiculous monsters. That doesn't mean we have to accept the foolish plot points and silly dialogue:""We opened Pandora's box. And there's no closing it now."" Jonah Allen (Charles Dance)The ""box"" is summer blockbusters, monsters who return relentlessly every summer. Don't think about it too hard. Just veg out with the geeks.","

This is the 3rd movie in the new MonsterVerse-it's kind of like the monster version of the Marvel Universe-with Godzilla_2014 being the first and Kong:Skull Island being the second and the 4th, Godzilla vs Kong, will be coming out in 2020. If you are a Godzilla fan, then you should enjoy this movie. Godzilla has more screen time than he did in the 2014 movie. Plus, you get more Titans-that's what the monsters are called here-including Mothra, Rodan and the 3 headed King Ghidorah. There are a few other new Titans, too. Kyle and Vera-both scientists-were married until one of the monster battles caused a death in their family and Kyle started drinking. Millie is their surviving child. Kyle and Vera had been working on a device to interact with the Titans-sending out sonic waves, it would either soothe the creatures or rile them up-before tragedy struck and after their separation, Vera kept working until she perfected the device on her own. Charles plays a mercenary that wants to get his hands on the device for his own reasons. There is an organization that studies these Titans-and even keeps some in captivity-called Monarch and they have branches scattered across the globe. During the end credits, they play the Blue Oyster Cult song 'Godzilla' but it is done by someone else-I saw their name during the credits but I have never heard of them. Speaking of credits, pay attention when they list the stars names, in particular, Godzilla, Mothra, etc. Make sure that you stay until after the end credits because their is an extra scene.
I really liked this entry in the Godzilla saga and would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Anurag-Shetty","2 June 2019","Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a direct sequel to Godzilla(2014). It is also the third entry in Warner Bros. & Legendary Pictures' Monster-verse, after Godzilla(2014) & Kong: Skull Island(2017). Monarch the agency that takes care of a wide spectrum of living creatures, do battle with a gang of monsters. These monsters include Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan & the three-headed Ghidorah.Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an awesome movie. Director Michael Dougherty has given us a movie that surpasses its 2014 predecessor & is on par with Kong: Skull Island(2017). The battles among all the various monsters aka Titans, are the highlights of the film. Towards the end though, these battles tend to get a tad bit repetitive. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. The cast makes this movie more relatable to the audience but, I wish they were given a bit more importance. Kyle Chandler is brilliant as Mark Russell. Vera Farmiga is spectacular as Dr. Emma Russell. Millie Bobby Brown is mind-blowing as Madison Russell. Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds & O'Shea Jackson Jr. are fantastic as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, Dr. Ilene Chen, Dr. Rick Stanton, Dr. Vivienne Graham, Jonah Alan, Sam Coleman, Colonel Diane Foster & Chief Warrant Officer Barnes, respectively.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ty-jensen","2 June 2019","I'm a casual moviegoer for Godzilla movies. I only seen the American Godzilla movies and I tried watching Godzilla Vs Mothra. I own Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island on DVD, they're not barebones.I enjoyed Godzilla: King of the Monsters, it's a fun monster movie. I honestly prefer the other MonsterVerse movies but I may reconsider. Godzilla himself has plenty of screentime, you don't have to wait long to see him. People were naturally disappointed his role was small in the reboot, I knew about it going in because of FaceBook.Apparently people complained about the reboot's lack of action because this movie is action packed, the first action scene begins around the ten minute mark. The action scenes are fun but the second one was filmed a little closely and the third one was bland. The visuals are gorgeous but we know that from the trailers. I think the reboot's visuals were fine.Like most blockbusters, the characters are boring. Kyle Chandler and Vera Fermiga plays scientists and a divorced couple. Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things plays their daughter, a brave girl interested in science. Aaron Taylor-Johnson doesn't return but Ken Watanbe does. The acting was fine, I think Millie gives the best performance.Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a fun monster movie, I'm not sure if it's good though. I just moved so I was a little stressed. If you love Godzilla, you will see it sooner or later. If you love action movies like myself, you should see it at least once. Godzilla Vs Kong comes out in March 2020, it should be fun.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","rupert-ian","31 May 2019","Again we see just how ridiculously out of touch the film critics are, as audiences are enjoying this movie while they give it the equivalent of an ""F"" grade...let that sink in. An F??? Really?I've never been in a movie with so much cheering and positive audience reactions. People loved it.But why are critics hating it? Are they paid shills? Are they mad that their environmental extremism is painted in a negative light, as the villains in the movie adopt the ""world will end in 12 years"" fanaticism. They decide to awaken all the Titans so they can kill off billions of humans in order to send us back to the stone age and ""save the earth"". I think that might have ruffled some feathers.The effects are amazing. The monster action is amazing and has just the right amount. The acting is fine, the plot is fine.Anyone saying they are a long time fan of Godzilla but they hate this movie really makes me wonder...be honest, the plots and acting in the old movies was ridiculous but we watched them for the cool monster action and came to love the campy acting and plot as well. This isn't campy, it's just right for a modern telling of a classic Godzilla story with the four main monsters from the O.G. series. And they did the characters right, they didn't pull any RJ ""subverting expectations"". They listened to the criticism of the hardcore fans towards the 2014 movie and made the right adjustments. This will easily be my favorite Godzilla movie along side the original movie that started it all.The plot and acting in this movie is A+ compared to the old Godzilla movies, and I love them all.Let's hope the critics joining hands in trying to tank this movie doesn't work. If this had been made by Disney and was an exact remake of an old Godzilla movie, they would be calling it brilliant.Thankfully Godzilla vs Kong is already in post production, so even if their efforts succeed in making this a financial failure, we will still get that movie at least...Rodan was amazing. Mothra was awesome. I could have used more of both.Godzilla and Ghidorah were perfect.If you're a monster movie fan, you'll love this. Plain and simple. People like Stuckman claiming to be a Godzilla fan, yet giving this a poor review are liars. The out of touch critics can't objectively look at this movie and see that it does exactly what it sets out to do. What kind of scale are they using here? They praise Last Jedi while they tank this movie...one alienated a large portion of the long-time fan base, the other gave real fans exactly what they wanted. That deserves a good rating on its own.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","crazykingzx","30 May 2020","I keep seeing lots of reviews saying this film is really bad or medicore, and I have to disagree here. As a Godzilla fan myself I loved this movie and it was almost everything I hoped for a sequel to Godzilla (2014). Lots of things were better here like more monster screen time, more fights, music from the old movies, and lots of fanservice. The characters may not be great or memorable (which their a lot off), but there at least interesting enough for me to care. The monsters on the other hand are just so fun see like Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah. They all have lots of personality and cool abilities. They steal the show when there on screen and the soundtrack is fantastic. Akira Ifukube music is remixed a little or orchestrated and it sounds beautiful and epic. Its not a perfect film, but as Godzilla film, it is.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","sanjidparvez","1 June 2019","After watching this today, I must say, by far KONG: SKULL ISLAND is the best movie in the franchise; it was the most 'perfectly balanced' addition to the series in terms of entertainment level, setting human characters into the story, monster screen time as well as constructing their each stages of fight.
In the 2nd place, I'd put KOTM but it was mostly because of the awesome representation of the other big 3 of Kaiju realm...Rodan, Mothra & Ghidorah. Other than that, now it seems Gareth Edwards' 2014 GODZILLA at least did better than KOTM in terms of the Scale/size representation of the monsters, the momentum build up before their each appearance as well as treatments of the human characters(!). There's no short-lived, moving character like Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody this time; instead they introduced a kind of similar major character, Dr. Emma Russel (played by Vera Farmiga) but with questionable or at times laughable motivation & decision making level. Moreover, the way they put Millie Bobby Brown's 'Madison' into the midst of the epic finale also wasn't convincing at all, IMO. That being said, KOTM is still a great fan service for the Kaiju lovers. Monsters' brawls were quite epic from start to finish, specially Rodan & Mothra both were phenomenal and I wish they would have made a solo film for both of them in between of Skull Island & KOTM. Absolutely loved the way they introduced Ghidorah with distinctive personality for each of his head, he was totally the big badass of the story like the way he deserved to be in. Expected to see a little more diversified range of other monsters but overall Michael Dougherty & his team did a good job regarding the mythological aspects of the Titans.Aside from the cheesy writings here & there, GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is an absolute must see for fans of big G; a solid summer blockbuster. I'll give it another watch pretty soon.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Ed-from-HI","2 June 2019","I don't understand the mostly negative critical feedback (and less than stellar box office performance) for our longtime (i.e. Lifelong) massively Titanic thespian Hero Godzilla/Gojira.I really thought ""Godzilla King of the Monsters' would usher in/ solidify the multi-film/ multi-Year 'Dai-Kaiju' (Giant-monster) Cinematic Universe (akin to Marvel's or at least DC's). Fortunately, we do have at least one more Titanic Behemoth match-up to look forward to: next Year's Godzilla vs. Kong.But on to the review of ""Gojira: king of the Monsters"" =
I have to agree that the definite strength of this film is in the Dai-kaiju amazingly-artistic screen-representations and terrifyingly-beautiful characterizations, this film should rate a minimum 7/10 just for getting the 4 primary Toho Leads so massively & impressively (and in the case of king Ghidorah frighteningly) right-on-the-mark! Seriously, the CGI effects here (and artistically rendered Creature-concepts) exhibit a genuine amount of artistry and hyper-imagination but also deliver in terms of providing the audience with literal & visceral 'Earth-shaking' impacts that seem to go far beyond any giant-monster Epics of the past (the only downside being that the two main Godzilla vs. Ghidorah monster smack-downs are shot within environs of snow-storm and rain-storm respectively - I do wish one of the main Events was featured in the clear light of day).Mothra (especially larva-form was also amazingly well-done, exhibiting a real 'personality' with emotions at times (Mothra in fully-winged form should have been featured a bit more at the end, she definitely gives Godzilla a great energy 'power-up' assist - but the transfiguration happens so fast, that I don't think the general audience received the full emotional impact of Mothra's ultimate 'sacrifice' - you needed to be somewhat familiar with Toho Heisei period Mothra (and fire-Rodan from the same period) to fully-understand the shorthand synergy (of combined Godzilla + Mothra-spirit-energy) at the finale.I would say that director Michael Daugherty over-produced and over-delivered on the Godzilla vs Ghidorah massively-awesome + genuinely visceral Visuals (probably in response to the fact that Gareth Edwards original 2014 Godzilla although very well-made, came-up a bit short on action) - however, it is true that Daugherty might have sacrificed some story elements and a bit of clear linear narrative in order to ensure the near wall-to-wall action that definitely satisfies lifelong Godzilla/Gojira fans but might have left general fans a bit mystified by the narrative-shorthand that seemed tailor made to suit the Toho (both Showa & Heisei) Godzilla die-hards (like me) - but either way, Godzilla merited at least 7/10 even for a general audience Score - and probably a 9 to 10 for Toho die-hards!Finally, I actually thought the acting performances were good to outstanding; outstanding were Ken Watanabe as 'Serizawa' the one human that seems to truly understand Godzilla's importance/ gravitas (and even exhibits a bit of 'spiritual' link with the greatest Dai-kaiju).... Charles Dance as the intensely focused and quite menacing Eco-terrorist head was brilliant as usual.... Millie Bobby Brown gives an earnest, believable and emotionally-resonant performance as Madison Russell..... and Vera Farmiga is solid (as usual) as Emma Russell (although she should have been given more time to explain why she released Ghidorah without more forethought as to innocent lives that would be unnecessarily lost ..... that seemed to be the major non-sequitur of the film's narrative since Emma seemed otherwise quite humane and level-headed).In Summary, I think Mike Doughety's ""Godzilla King of the Monsters"" most definitely delivers for Godzilla fans in almost every way....... And makes Lifelong fans glad that Big G will be back for at least one more action-packed outing with Kong next summer.... And hopefully many more cinematic adventures after that!There is still a lot here for general audiences in terms of positively beautiful (and artistic) visuals and believably lifelike renditions of the 4 main Toho charismatic Behemoth anti-Heroes .... the narrative could have been a bit tighter but the acting performances are actually much better than critics would lead you to believe..... bottom-line: very enjoyable popcorn flick for general audiences (but for Lifelong Gojira fans, much much more!)","

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Godzilla: King of the Monsters. very much in the genre of Clash of the Titans, we find ourselves watching clash of the monsters. This is very much a film for those who love extreme epic battles fought by the gargantuan. The CGI is something else. Used in most films these days it still has the power to awe. What come from the minds of the writers, directors and producers is brought to life by these keyboard computer magicians. Not the greatest of plots but who needs it when it's visually stimulating. One thing I did love was the use of the Osprey throughout the film, although some of the landing and take off scenes were pretty unbelievable. If you're a monster fan, or more to the point if you are a Godzilla fan you will love this film.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","rgkarim","1 June 2019","The start of summer is the start of big movies and this weekend opens up with the ""king"" of blockbusters in the form of big monsters. Over many years, the giant monster movies have intrigued many and disgusted others, but they exist nonetheless to unleash their own brand of big budget chaos to the world. Yet with mixed results, can this genre find the right audiences or are we still plagued by the modern era of too much bang and not enough buck?

SUMMARY:Big budget films about monsters require a lot of things to appeal to the mass audiences and much of it has to with special effects and action. The King Of The Monsters manages to focus much on this, becoming a special effects extravaganza that did not yield to the limitations of speakers and screens. The animation is on point, and many of the creatures look stellar in their design, throwing away the prosthetics and papier Mache for stellar high definition CGI graphics. Smooth monster animation that looks to stick to anatomical movements are beautifully unleashed and it helps bring these monsters one step closer to being real. Eventually the monsters start battling and the action scenes have a number of special effects in both sound effects and visual styles to unleash Armageddon on the big screen. Those who love seeing chaos unleashed with little else binding them, and getting a little more human involvement as well, should be pleased with the destruction at hand in that fastest way possible. This is especially true in the final battle, where the behemoths battlegrounds hold much to be destroyed, assisted by theater shaking sound editing, an epic symphony score to add edge, flashy blasts from the atomic driven beasts, and plenty artificially generated beasts to fill your eyes. It's climactic and satisfying, and something I was hoping to see since the trailers showed.
With special effects focus though, the movie sort of stumbles on other categories that still need some work for this reviewer. The opening of the film is rather boring, a jumbled mess of convoluted introductions, explanations about what is going on and the human focus that will lead to all the mess. For a movie about monsters, much of the screen time still focuses on the terrors of humanity, focusing on how much we suck in our attempts to control everything. Unlike Kong, Godzilla's second arc still has trouble grounding its size to a deeper plot, that involves interacting with these creatures more than from the safeties of the bunkers. Even if you don't care about the story, the action scenes are also in need of some work, even the climactic ending. For one thing, many of the fights are very short lived, over in mere minutes after buildups of more talking from humans. The Fight with Rodan might have been my favorite, having the most integration of human and beast combination that brought me into the zone, but other times it was a jumbled mess of quick shots of stuff blowing up before panning back to humans. Other times, there were shaky bouts of camera work of close up monsters and falling buildings. This improved at the end, but it took a long time to discover something other films have already mastered. Finally, the number of monsters represented was not awful, but again trying to put too many in for them doing very little is a component that annoys me. Mothra and Rodon were kind of there, hitting there moments at the right times, but not maximized. Other creatures we get to see passing shots of, but they were unnecessary when we could have had more epic monster battles.
As you can see, the King Of Monsters is certainly going to hold the special effect event of the summer, or at least pretty close to it. It's problem is, that it's imbalance issues continue to mix the movie up in a messy sorts that some will love and others won't. The monster aspect gets points for chaos, destruction, and special effects that these movies thrive on so monster fans should be stoked by these aspects. The action again is mixed for me, part awesome with the special effects and yet part disappointing because of the fast pace, focus on humans more than monsters, and shaky camera work that could have been expanded upon. Perhaps the next installment can figure out the chemistry to the monster movie balance and bring back the magic of the dying genre. Still with all the special effects and monsters in this film, despite how imbalanced they are, the movie is worth the visit to the theater. So check it out when you can.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5","

If you don't like a rough ride stay away as it's not for the faint hearted, I heard several people scream in fear, it was great.....lolThis movie within its genre was nearly perfect, we had large plastic monsters, heroic mucho behaviour, an incomprehensible plot, action, the chase, mysticism, treachery, and lots of gadgets and boys toys. It all came together into a fabulous movie, it's not for everyone, it won't win an Oscar, so what Philistines it was a fabulous night out.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","justin-fencsak","2 June 2019","I first saw Godzilla when it was on TV in the late 80s on local TV and grew up with the Hanna Barbera cartoons on TNT when they aired it during the Godzilla 1998 craze and bought the original badly dubbed Godzilla 1956 on vhs before seeing the uncut Japanese version on Amazon Prime years later. In 2014 i rented the first ever Godzilla movie meant to be part of a different universe, the Monsterverse, which consists of Godzilla, Kong Skull Island, which i liked, and this one, followed by Godzilla vs Kong. I saw this movie in 3d and enjoyed it very much. It actually moves at a good pace and a post credits scene shows what happens to one of the monsters after the big battle is over. Millie Bobbie Brown is great and so is Vera Farminga and the monsters are the stars of the show. The music is also great and pays homage to the original classic and there is a great cover version of Blue Oyster Cult's hit song Godzilla in the end credits. Long Live The King!!!!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","HairyMart1","30 May 2019","So what's to say about this film since the title and trailer make it abundantly clear what it is. Giant monster fights Vs other Giant monsters, and not surprisingly, people, cities and everything else gets squished in the process. As before there are some people running around to let you know where the action is and what the name is of the current onscreen beasty. They are all fine with the little they have to work with - mostly an awe inspired stare. Still nice to see that Millie Bobby Brown can do good work with limited opportunity. As for everything it's all pretty good, though I do wish they had managed to incorporate the Clair de Lune music into the film, that was used to such great effect in the trailer. Effects are all first class, maybe a bit more variety in the design of the ""bad"" monsters would have helped, and on a personal note much preferred Gareth Edwards fleet glimpse of the creatures, rather than the full on in your face option here. Still it does what's its supposed to on the monster fight side, and there are some wonderfully composed shots with these behemoths framed against a firey background.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","subxerogravity","1 June 2019","Overall, this was nicely done. It's a very old school styled monster flick. Thought I was watching a Godzilla movie made in Japan back in the 70s. It's a big movie that can be clumpy and clunky at times. It tries to hard to make this movie connect to the monsterverse they want to make. Too much info is packed in with too much CGI action and it shows a lot, but Godzilla is truly some star power and he does not let down when he gets on the screen. Not as much monster mashing as I thought but his battles with the three headed alpha were impressive. I liked the human cast. They did good with the overload of story they were given. Plus I saw it in imax and I'm not complaining, it was worth it.","

It's a huge improvement on the first one which I thought was just average. There's a lot more action and different monsters which was very entertaining. It has a good story, wasn't too much like some films are.
As well as the big action set pieces it has a very good lead cast and supporting cast. It's over 2 hours long but didn't feel like it, there were no times where the story dragged, it was just right.
It's refreshing to see a blockbuster film that's not superheroes all the time. Godzilla is the new superhero and if watching giant movies on the big screen is your thing then I highly recommend this film.","

Godzilla has much more screen time and truly epic fight scenes with the other monsters. The CG is incredible and never dips in quality. It's extremely well paced, moving from one amazing set piece to the next and has fantastic music by Bear McCreary. It's well filmed and has some visually stunning moments throughout and Michael Dougherty's direction is great. Ken Watanabe, Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown all give great performances but there are too many human characters resulting in a few actors getting sidelined. Luckily the focus stays on the monsters and it's title character.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","stevenrotherforth","16 October 2019","Godzilla: King Of The MonstersOkay so let's not go on too much about the plot of this movie because for what there is of one it's a bit of a stretch.
Not the monsters! Anyone going to see this are already onboard with the premise of Skyscraper sized beasties battling each other.
It's the reasoning how we get to the showdowns that takes a lot of swallowing.
Even Godzilla himself would struggle to digest the lunacy of this films story. But if like me you just want to see big ass monsters beat the snot out of each other then you are in for a treat.Expanding on the already established Monsterverse this latest instalment sees the titular Kaiju take on a whole host of unearthed mega beasts.
That's as far as I'll go in terms of the actual movie.
What you wanna know is if this is any good?
Well the answer is for those who couldn't wait to buy a ticket or purchase this film on Blu-ray, it's a resounding yes!
Absolutely! A 2hr 12 min fun fest of pure action and carnage.
If you are one who craves a good script and fine character development,
then you will be massively disappointed.
Acting is adequate in delivering poor dialogue. Characters are purely there to provide exposition and to fill in the gaps between CGI creatures kicking the crap out of each other.
This is not Oscar worthy material.
However what is Oscar worthy are the special effects and sound design.On 4K Blu-ray this film is of reference quality.
Presented in Dolby Vision this is one stunning looking movie.
Specular highlights are often blinding as this is a predominantly dark movie.
Scenes with car headlamps, explosions and Godzilla's atomic breath are very vibrant.
Dark scenes have immense shadow detail due to the advanced HDR that Dolby Vision offers.
This is a noticeable upgrade in terms of overall clarity compared to the 1080p Blu-ray.
It's not a 4K crisp image due to a layer of grain added in post production but this does give the movie a more cinematic look.It can't be denied that this movie is of epic scale.
The battle of the beasts is further elevated by a demo worthy Dolby Atmos sound mix.
This is the best 4K Blu-ray I have heard so far in 2019.
Bass is certainly the dish of the day and it's served up in Kaiju sized portions.
Every moment of this film offers some sort of aural perfection.
For those of you who have a dedicated Home Cinema system then prepare to have the plaster removed from your ceilings.
Right from the opening credits this movie rumbles with violent impactful sound. Prepare to strap your Subwoofer down as it will probably move around the room.
If the LFE is rocking then surround sound effects are equally impressive.
Fighter jets pass from speaker to speaker. Missles wizz pass the ear.
This is surround sound heaven.
The Atmos technology is utilised perfectly with Godzillas roar heard from above. This is a treat indeed for the Home theatre enthusiast.The movie may lack in some areas such as having a logical plot and characters with any substance.
I don't want to go into spoilers. Just watch and see.
However as a 'Take your brain out and have fun' piece of entertainment,
'Godzilla King Of The Monsters' is an absolute atomic blast.","

Anyone of them that didn't come and bow down basically has a movie coming starring them catching a beat down. I also love how they really tied the King Kong movie into this movie.

Great for the ""Creature Feature"" spectacle !!Co-written and directed by Michael Dougherty, who has also helmed the spook-fests Trick 'r Treat and Krampus, Godzilla: King of the Monsters stars Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown.There's no such thing as too much Godzilla!Apart from Gojira and Shin Gojira, none of the movies that make up the source material are particularly 'deep' . It needs big, pretty-looking action. It needs a handful of things to look at (for the awe of the Kaiju/Titans is half the fun) this film does it in spades! I got just what I payed for !! An epic Kaiju Battle Royale . Godzilla King of the Monsters was fabulous especially for fans of the original Toho Kaiju genre.It delivers far more satisfying thrills and terrific spectacle when it comes to what fans expect from these kinds of films. Indulges in all the kaiju fights ! 8/10
Godzilla aka Monster Zero.How many of the original Godzilla suits have been preserved?Yes, some of the original Godzilla and kaiju suits do still exist. The majority of the suits used in the Toho Studios productions of the Godzilla series were made of latex, rubber, and foam rubber, and were designed to be used in multiple films. However, due to the nature of these materials and the wear and tear from filming, many of the suits have been either repurposed, destroyed, or worn out over time. There are a few original suits that have been preserved and are on display at museums and special exhibitions, such as the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City and the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo.The oldest Godzilla suit Toho still has is the 1994 suit used in the Heisi era film Godzilla vs Space Godzilla. All other suits before that have either rotted or been destroyed to the point where they are not recognizable anymore. These are rubber suits and they do rot over time no matter preserved they are kept. They mostly have suits from the millennium era.Now if they had the original 1954 suit above that would be priceless and be kept in a glass container with tight security. But its been 65 years since the original film and the suit does not exist anymore. So Toho decided to make a replica suit from the 1954 film and they did a great job.The oldest suit that still exists is the one from 1994's Godzilla vs Space Godzilla. I have never seen this film I need to add it to my list !","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kjproulx","2 June 2019","I'll be straight right off the bat and state that I haven't seen the endless slew of Godzilla movies that were made in Japan. I've seen the original Gojira film from 1954, the awful American remake in 1998, and the 2014 version, which kicked off this new run of films that Warner Bros. hopes to make into a giant franchise, crossing over with King Kong. With all of that out of the way, I was going into this sequel hoping for some monster action that far exceeded its predecessor. It may be the fact that only briefly knew the names of these others monsters throughout the film, but having not seen the classic franchise, seeing them for the first time here was quite the spectacle. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is by no means perfect, but I believe it's worth seeing for the visuals alone.Loosely following Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as they plan to slowly release each new found monster one by one, they're caught in a bind when things begin to go astray and every one of them is released at once. With the falling out of their family in the past, Madison must decide if her father or mother is truly the one on the right side of things. Aside from that, this movie is all about the spectacle of giant monsters fighting, with a clear set-up that will eventually lead to the film Godzilla vs. Kong next year. If you can invest yourself in the numerous overblown action sequences, then this is the movie for you.The human characters are throwaways, even though I would like to put an asterisk next to Millie Bobby Brown's name. Although she is given some of the worst dialogue in the movie (and there is a lot of that to go around at times), she is a fantastic young actress that will only continue to strengthen her ability to steal the show as time goes on. The humans throughout the course of Godzilla: King of the Monsters really do feel like plot devices or stereotypical scientists just so that these monsters have a logical reason for being released to fight. For that reason, I found no possible way to fall in love with this movie at all.That being said, the promotional material for this movie has been promising a lot of action and a lot of action is what is presented here. There are some massive throwdowns and the CGI is quite impressive as well. On top of the action, this is a very well-shot film by cinematographer Lawrence Sher. Yes, the visual effects definitely add to his shot composition, but there are some beautiful images sprinkled throughout this film, making a few moments during the battle scenes feel like a piece of art.In the end, Godzilla: King of the Monsters put the human characters in the back seat in terms of development, which works out in terms of presenting numerous action scene, but ultimately feels slightly hollow at times because of that. From the very nice score that gave me chills at times, to the visual effects actually impressing me quite a bit, I was able to forgive many of the flaws here. That's not something I usually say, so I'm giving quite a bit of praise to the overall look of the film and the spectacle that goes along with it. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a good movie with many issues, but I really would recommend it to action/monster movie fans.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kluseba","31 May 2019","Three years ago, Shin Godzilla was the most mature entry in the franchise that surprised with a surprisingly realistic plot, lots of political drama and intriguing characters. But that was a Japanese movie while Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an American film that rather follows the gloomy Godzilla released five years earlier that was overall convincing despite a few lengths. This movie here rather compares to the shallow Kong: Skull Island and offers a brainless but entertaining spectacle.To be honest, this new film is rated so positively because the special effects are astonishing, the pace is breathtaking and the monsters look amazing. Godzilla gets defeated on two occasions but always manages to come back stronger than before. The return of King Ghidorah is spectacular and the monster convinces as giant antagonist. Rodan is also featured in a few scenes but far from being the most spectacular monster. Mothra's appearance is somewhat disappointing as the legendary character only appears for a few scenes and fails to impress.The story however is insultingly ridiculous. It features many plot holes and the characters are constantly making stupid decisions. One can't expect performances worthy of Academy Awards of course but the characters in this film are particularly irrational, shallow and unlikable. Especially the Russell family is quite annoying. The mother is willing to sacrifice humanity because she can't cope with the loss of her son. Her daughter follows her blindly, constantly risking her own life and those of others around her. The father is arrogant, grumpy and headstrong as he ignores orders and thinks he is cleverer than anyone else. One couldn't care less about such antipathic characters.In the end, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the kind of film that invites to switch your brain off and enjoy a colourful, effect-ridden and fast-paced spectacle. This film is great for what it is but might only be memorable for young audiences and those who aren't familiar with the legendary franchise. Some of the old Japanese movies were also quite silly but the original Godzilla: King of the Monsters which was released sixty-five years ago is still more thought-provoking, realistic and dramatic than this high-budget Hollywood flick. Hollywood should leave this Japanese franchise alone and Western cinemas should have the courage to show films like Shin Godzilla in the future.","

These creatures are so quiet you can't hear a 100 ft object moving in the ocean? How useless are your ocean microphones?

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","jaybizman","9 November 2020","I've probably seen all the Godzilla movies, from Toho's guy in
a rubber suit from the late fifties, until the latest -
""King of the Monsters."" And IMO, this one rates a sold nine.After a bit of a slow start it get's going and The Big Guy is now - HUGE.
(In preparation for next years Godzilla v Kong.)Standout (apart from the well done Titans) is 15 yr old 'Millie Bobby Brown',
who is already a Hollywood Star (last seen in Enola Holmes), who was paid
One Million Dollars for this outing and THREE Million for the next Godzilla.
Pretty impressive for a teenager, who acting coaches say is a natural.So after Kong: Skull Island, and Godzilla: King of the Monsters; everything
is set up for the big rumble in 2021 between the two Titans. I can't wait.","

The special effects were superb and the story followed a consistent plot line. There were no glaring plot holes...maybe a few things that you'd shake your head at. However, this is science fiction and it should be possible to overlook a few things. It's just a movie about giant monsters, after all. I suppose there are people out there that didn't like the fact that the environmentalists were the crazy ones in the movie...so they gave it a poor rating???","

I will say one thing about the part where they discover Godzilla in a ancient sunken city with the help of Mothra. One guy thinks its ancient Egyptian but when I saw it and from all the stories I have read about one sunken city, only 1 place came to mind and I know I'm right about it. The sunken city is supposed to be Atlantis.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","skjoe-1","29 May 2019","As a child growing up watching and falling in love with the Godzilla franchise, this film delivered everything I wanted. It's a rewarding experience for fans of these monsters and they are done justice and not just visually or in the action scenes. Firstly you will be glad to know this does contain a hell of a lot more Titan scenes than 2014's Godzilla. They aren't totally dominating the screen but without the human characters the plot wouldn't be able to progress. This is also the case in most of the old Godzilla movies, occasionally involving politics or issues like the environment and man vs nature.
My only issue with this film is not a technical one within the film itself but I think the more of a Godzilla fan you are, the higher your enjoyment will be through this movie. If you don't know any of the monsters or some of their history it might not bring a huge smile to their face when you first see Mothra or they may not get pumped up when Godzilla and Ghidorah finally meet.
The films plot revolves around using a sonar device to send out signals to awaken certain titans, all in the hopes of restoring balance to the world. It isn't exactly the selling point of the movie it serves as more of a way to move our characters towards the next goal, a titan or the next conflict.
Although the human characters aren't (and never really were) the sole focus of these types of films, I find myself not disliking them. I actually kinda routed for them, Millie Bobby Brown is wonderful and charming, Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler were fine, this family that has fallen apart and lost a child due to the events of the first film. I was hoping for them to reconcile throughout and make it, which helped the tension throughout some intense action scenes. The rest of the supporting cast weren't really memorable but I didn't mind.
As a mega fan I was super excited everytime a new monster would emerge, or a conflict was about to erupt I was filled with child like wonder and sheer joy at watching these icons from the monster movie universe being presented. It wasn't just the fantastic design, making each one feel unique or the way they moved and sounded when they roared. It was that each one had a personality and wasn't pushed to the side or felt like they didn't matter in the final fight. They aren't the only monsters in this film but these 4 serve as the main stars of the show. I loved the build up to each battle, the cinematography and the epic pure colossal scale of each beast squaring each other off before charging into each other firing off atomic blasts and lightning just gets my blood pumping everytime.
To sum up, Godzilla King of the Monsters is a solid monster battle on a grand scale, that will satisfy you on the visuals and sound alone. If your a big fan of this franchise, it's a true delight, the ultimate clash of the titans done justice with a big budget and with a director who is actually a fan of the characters. A must see!
P.S. You will fall in love with Mothra!","

Give this movie franchise 10 years time and give it to someone who wants to make a movie about monsters, gods, titans, whatever. And it doesn't have to be 132 minutes long if you have nothing to show!

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kane_1371-117-231060","29 May 2019","This is just pure madness.
Remember when Pacific Rim came out and we imagined what would a godzilla movie done in the same manner look like?
Well we got it, kind of.
I have been so underwhelmed by the recent movies and certain series that I have not written a review in a while but this right here deserves one.
Godzilla: KOTM is a visually stunning, impactful and thrilling Hollywood remaster of the Showa and heisei era monster movies.
I believe that if it was not for the adoration Pacific rim got from the fans we would not get this movie as we all know Hollywood likes to play it extremely safe.
Godzilla: KOTM delivers on that power fantasy that pacific rim brought to our attention ten folds but falls short on the balance that Rim had between the crazy kaiju battles and the outside world.
It probably was not even the directorial team's focus either and that is fine, movies are not supposed to be following the same recipe all the time anyway.
The Godzilla of the Legendary was not the only American redesign that was done right, this time we get to see more and every single monster is looking great.
My favorite is of course Ghidorah as I always imagined him with much bigger and menacing wings than what Japanese movies showed and here we got that.
The sound effect in this movie is bombastic and complements the action shown on the screen and the music is far better than the reclined back seat annoyance that Godzilla 2014 was.
The best part was the use of original Godzilla and Mothra themes which I felt was a big miss that it was missing from the 2014 movie (Godzilla theme of course).
Among the horrible Disney movies of recent release I am glad that a few movies came out that I could actually enjoy.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Troy_Campbell","31 May 2019","Checklist: skyscraper-sized atomic-lizard creature. Tick. Electricity-breathing three-headed dragon. Tick. Gargantuan luminescent moth and behemoth aircraft-eating pterodactyl. Tick and tick. All of the above battling for supremacy in our modern cities. Tick. If this all sounds as riveting as your list of chores for the weekend, then you can quickly and safely assume this movie isn't for you. If, on the other hand, that catalogue of mayhem-causing monsters gets you excited then this sequel could be right up your alley. Doubling down on the gigantic-scale action of 2014's Godzilla (and, well, every Godzilla movie), this follow-up ditches the slow-burn build up and cranks out set-piece after set-piece at a rapid rate, seemingly introducing a new element into each sequence. It occasionally suffers from Transformers style action - choppy camerawork, rampant editing and fuzzy CGI - but it thankfully minimises this in favour of monumental wide shots that artfully display the titans or in extreme close-ups that accentuate the enormous size disparity with humans. The sound design is once again on point too, the thunderous roars and penetrating shrieks reverberating through your body whilst Zilla's radiation-charging power-ups instantly gets the adrenaline pumping. Although kicking big goals in the action/spectacle department, the dramatic narrative filler is a major hurdle, particularly when it bloats the runtime to over two hours. Swapping out the Ford family from the first instalment for the equally boring Russell's here, the over-seriousness in which their familial turmoil plays out is completely misjudged and unnecessary. Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown are all decent actors, but they're regularly asked to make the dumbest decision available to them and sell it like they're in an Oscar contender. At least Ken Watanabe and Charles Dance are having fun in their ham-fisted roles. Needlessly earnest and po-faced human relationships aside, King of the Monsters delivers impressive blockbuster thrills deserving of a big screen viewing.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","MrDHWong","30 May 2019","Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an action film based on the Toho distributed series of monster films and the sequel to the American 2014 Godzilla film. Directed by Michael Dougherty (Krampus), it is a loud, explosive continuation of the MonsterVerse that delivers just what it promises, both good and bad.Five years after the events of 2014 film, the giant monster Godzilla has been closely tracked by the top secret agency known as ""Monarch"". From what Monarch has observed, Godzilla has no personal interest in purposely hurting humans and only intends to reaffirm his status as King of the Monsters. However, one day the giant three-headed extraterrestrial monster King Ghidorah is awoken from his frozen tomb in Antarctica and sets out to challenge Godzilla's supremacy in an all out fight to the death. To make matters worse, other ancient monsters reawaken as well, including Mothra the flying insectoid and Rodan the Pteranodon, causing mass destruction around the world. With the ever growing challengers for dominance showing up one by one, Godzilla fights his way through his opponents to try reclaiming his place as King, all the while humanity can only watch on in horror.As an improvement over its predecessor, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is pure fanservice for any hardcore fan of the franchise and provides just enough entertainment for newcomers. One common complaint about the 2014 film was Godzilla's lack of screentime and general slow pace. Thankfully, the filmmakers appear to listened to feedback as this film fixes most of that with its quick over-the-top action scenes and, as a result, it is never boring. Unfortunately, most of the human characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. Most of the time, they are only there for the purposes of exposition or to spout some cliched dialogue (""May God have mercy on us all!""). Despite this, the action is fantastic enough to forgive some of it. Watching these iconic giant beasts fight to the death while causing collateral damage to nearby buildings is still incredibly satisfying to see on the big screen. Audiences must also remember that films like this are made as enjoyable popcorn entertainment and not on an intellectual basis. Personally, I place this film in the ""guilty pleasures"" category, alongside the likes of Independence Day and Jurassic World. Be sure to stay after the credits for a bonus scene likely related to the upcoming ""Godzilla vs. Kong""I rate it 7/10","

He shows up more often and is accompanied by some truly stunning monsters. They are a sight to behold and showcase the movie's terrific visuals. However, I don't come to a Godzilla movie to watch pointless family melodrama. The focus should be on the monsters and while there is more screen time devoted to them in this sequel, there is still way too much time spent following dull human characters. Any time a cool fight scene occurs, the film cuts away to the dumb humans and takes you out of the action. The main takeaway from the film though, and the thing most fans care about, is that the Godzilla fight scenes are fantastic and worth the price of admission.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Alexander_Blanchett","30 May 2019","It was a fine sequel not better or worse than the original. It switches the qualities and flaws of the first one. So here we have much more Monster action, that is really thrilling at times. Really good special effects and many amazing Monster shots. Ghidora is really fantastic and a lot of fun.
The flaw is , in which the first part was stronger, are the characters. There are just very few you really care about or are properly developed.
Kyle Chandler is not really changing his facial expression throughout the whole film. Also Vera Farming has seen much stronger days in her career. Ken Watanabe Is very cartoonish in general. Sally Hawkins was rather useless which was the biggest waste of the entire film. I liked Ziyi Zhang who finally got a role in a Hollywood film again and the best part of the film was Millie Bobby Brown.
The screenplay deserved more work besides the character development as well but for the fact that it purely concentrated on the fight scenes between the titans it was fine enough as it offered many epic moments.","

The plots including human characters don't seem interesting when you want to see giant monsters fighting. But I've usually liked at least the monsters - the oldschool rubber/model creatures.This movie was very boring to me because the the human characters are uninteresting, and their drama and arguing seems dumb considering giant monsters are on the loose. And the computer-generated monsters themselves just don't seem real to me. It's as if they are not there. It's not the worst ever graphics but still makes me feel deceived. Godzilla is supposed to be cool, but this isn't.I liked the fact that there are multiple monsters including King Ghidorah, even though they way they were used wasn't very good.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","AhmedSpielberg99","23 June 2020","The cast deserves better than this. Because it's the dynamic between Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe and Ziyi Zhang is what made the scenes they share more tolerable despite some atrocious dialogue and unbearably cringe-worthy one-liners. And because Millie Bobby Brown could have single-handedly made the formulaic dramatic arc work if it wasn't for the fact the film went for the action from the get-go and for almost the entire first 40 minutes, which is basically consists of a set of crammed together segments of non-stop action and explosions which are all devoid of the slightest tension.After showing many monsters on screen, for a reason or no reason, to give those who hated Godzilla what they wanted, the plot began to unravel. But the rest of the movie isn't actually any better. As the more the story proceeds, the clearer it appears how superficial and uninspired it is. I liked both Gareth Edwards's Godzilla and Jordan Vogt-Roberts's Kong: Skull Island, so it's not like I can't stand a mindless creature feature, but this is just extremely poorly made. Even the CGI that most people were praising I found quite disappointing. King Ghidorah, in particular, looks so cartoonish. I mean, Disney's Hercules's Hydra looks more realistic!(3/10)","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","deadprobal","5 June 2019","I dig monster movies. I love the concept of massive creatures that dwarf us. Something that started with my fascination of dinosaurs when I was a kid.
But to say that this movie was a disappointment is a gross understatement! Where are the good story tellers in Hollywood?!The Good:
1. Soundtrack
2. Sound Editing
3. Last minute of the final battle.The OK:
1. Monster design - Nothing spectacular. Especially did not like the design of the main antagonist. Seemed less organic and more of direct attempt to copy a certain design of a certain mythological beast.
2. Cinematography - Nothing new here. Broad sweeps of large areas and landscape, etc.
3. The conclusion.The Bad:
1. Side characters: Seems like the only reason most the side characters to exist was to fill a diversity and gender quota, to pay lip service to current trends. Just give them a few scenes with some dialogue and voila! Job done!
2. Obligatory side characters: ""Hey, we don't have a wise cracking guy..."" - Points randomly at a guy "" You be that guy. And be a .. I don't know...lead scientist. To justify your role.""
3. Dialogue: From the one liners to the nonsensical reactionary conversations, all seem to be very childish with little thought put into it.
4. Main characters: I like some of the actors, but the source material and direction was bad enough to make them seem poor at their jobs.
5. Obligatory roles: It's like the screenwriter/director had a checklist of things needed to do: Gender diversity. Check. Ethnic diversity. Check. Noble sacrificial situation/character. Check. Main character in bad situation to be saved. Check. Etc. Not the worst checklist, but even that didn't help.The Horrible:
1. Character motivations: Nonsensical, poorly portrayed and explained. And the decisions the supposedly intelligent people make are clearly not people with common sense do. Which leads to the next point.
2. Character Settings: The way this movie was likely made. The director/screenwriter wanted to create a tense situation. Doesn't matter if it makes logical sense for the actors involved, make them do stupid things, create an artificially charged situation, and then let them constantly survive again and again when they should have died in the first instance. Want to make us care for the main characters? Same modus operandi.The Unforgivable:
1. Contrivance: If there was ever a category at the Oscars for Contrivance, this movie would get it. If there was ever a Nobel Prize category for Contrivance this would win it! It's that bad. Right from the very first scene , till the end. It keeps getting hammered into the audiences face again and again and again!Honestly, it seemed like the movie was written/directed by a young child who doesn't exactly understand the basic elements of story telling. I didn't care for any of the characters, even those portrayed by actors I like! Even the few monster battles felt unepic for the most part, and dragged on. The main characters getting into impossibly dangerous situations like idiots, and surviving when they shouldn't have. Again and again and again.Never again will I watch a movie made by this director and screenwriter. I can do without the torture. Please don't suffer like I did!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","jacabiya","10 June 2019","I could barely see Mothra, couldn't see Godzilla nor the 3-headed monster he was fighting in dark Antartida at night, just before I left the theater. The cinematography was atrocious. Everything was dark, and I couldn't see a thing. That this happens in 2019 is incomprehensible to me. The kids in the audience didn't seem to mind, though.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","totalovrdose","31 May 2019","I was not a huge fan of the 2014 Godzilla, and I know there are many who share my thoughts on that - nuff said. I have been a fan of the franchise since I was a child, owning copies of the original 1954 and 1956 films, alongside having collected copies of multiple sequels throughout the years. To top it off, I still own the figurines my parents used to buy me as a child. In short, my expectations for monster movies are set at a high bar. To get the important stuff out of the way first, Godzilla looks amazing! The special effects in this film are incredible; everything from the movement to the sheer immensity of these creatures being impressive, the bombastic theme, not to mention the outstanding sound effects of the creatures themselves, really bringing them to life, and laying the groundwork for the epic confrontations. Unlike the 2014 film, these are, thankfully, not hidden behind television screens; we are thrust into the conflict, sometimes nose to nose with these behemoths, and you can really feel their proximity.The central conflict is, of course, Godzilla, versus the hydra, Ghidorah, who is an especially vicious antagonist. There are some small, yet great interactions between Godzilla and humanity, that show perhaps a softer side to this humongous brute, as he comes to understand the tiny animals he inhabits the world with, the use of facial motion capture being especially wonderful here; these moments are completely lacking with the unsympathetic Ghidorah, that seems hellbent on world domination - typical bad guy - but what a bad guy he is! Rodan is equally impressive, though it is Mothra who is the most beautiful of all - the musical score accompanying her, not to mention the awe on the faces of those who glimpse her, really accentuates her femininity, which brings about a sense of melancholy whenever she is present. The screen time of these two titans is underwhelming at best...as for the other titans that are present - their screen time is woeful at best - they were merely there for slight window dressing, which is disappointing. Addendum; I felt the tension during the confrontations could have been increased to really hit home the incredible danger that Godzilla faces.The feature opens similarly to the events of Dawn of Justice; we see the climatic battle of the previous film, from the perspective of another; a family who have just lost their son during the preceding struggle. Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) appears to have buried herself in her work since the tragedy, and though she is meant to be attached to her surviving daughter, Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown), who is established as an independent young lady with her own ideas, their relationship is not provided significant depth. If anything, Farmiga's character is a walking, talking inciting incident, used to propel the plot forward. Her husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler) is a far more interesting character. He appears passionate and knowledgeable about nature, which becomes quintessential to the narrative, and though he and Farmiga are meant to be kindred spirits on this topic, the film merely tells us her values, but illustrates his. Unlike his wife, he still appears to be genuinely reeling from the loss of his son, this inner conflict making it hard for him to empathise with Dr. Serizawa's (Ken Watanabe) plan to use Godzilla as humanity's last ditch effort for survival, making for an interesting sub-plot.Monarch again makes an appearance, though the image of it as a conglomerate on the verge of a hostile take-over, as the opening would have you believe, is hardly justified by the story. Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Sam Coleman (Thomas Middledicth) bring some light hearted humour to the film - occasionally these jokes don't land, but it does not detract from their characters, who we do get the chance to see as intelligent professionals. The always lovely Ziyi Zhang, as Dr. Ilene Chen, brings a good dose of wonder about the creatures, being as equally passionate as Dr. Serizawa, though her relationship with doppelganger, Dr. Ling, is never explored. Aisha Hinds, as the colonel of the operation, is continuously calm and collected, making for a believable female protagonist, and even David Strathairn has a cameo, though all of these characters really go to the wayside in contrast with the Russel family. Considering many characters are meant to be scientists, not talking about their areas of study; interests, motivations, and eventual hiring by Monarch, is a wasted opportunity. We are, quintessentially, surrounded by likable strangers for much of the two hour run time.The always entertaining Charles Dance, as Jonah Alan, has a history that is merely glossed over, and though his motivations are revealed, much like his character, they are hardly given significant screen time (and are borderline contradictory). I really wish we could have seen more of him, to get a better understanding of the operation he is launching. By the end of the movie, the place where we leave the humans on is anti-climatic at best - the same, thankfully, cannot be said for the 'monsters'.The movie occasionally suffers from Man of Steel syndrome - we see so much carnage, yet little consideration for the loss of human life. During conflicts involving soldiers, often, protagonists just leave them behind, seemingly unperturbed by their noble sacrifice. The movie also appears to be trying to make an argument about the effects of pollution and the need to save the environment, though considering the number of bombs that go off in this movie - that is hard to swallow.All in all, if you are like me, you will come to see Godzilla, and you will not be disappointed. There are some powerful human moments, one involving Dr. Serizawa and the monster he has been studying all this time is especially a standout. Another is a heated debate between Mark and Emma, where you can literally feel the tension. The movie, of course, like all franchises today, leaves it open for another - and if you wait until the very final end credits scene - what a universe they plan on creating.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Reviews_of_the_Dead","24 January 2020","Now anyone who knows me and my film tastes knows that I loved Godzilla films growing up. I tended to watch the same ones over and over again, but I ended up seeking all of them out as an adult. I remember seeing the 1998 remake with my father and sister in the theater. I enjoyed the most recent remake and the talk of this universe they were building. When hearing about this film, I had to see it. I thankfully got to see it early as a surprise showing was happening at my theater and then a second viewing of it on DVD. The synopsis is the crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.This film starts off back in 2014. In San Francisco when Godzilla was on a rampage there. Since then, the organization Monarch has been seeking out the large monsters to keep track of and monitor them. Their goal to keep them from waking up, but the military is considering just exterminating them to prevent the loss of human life. I should point out here that it is an interesting nod to all of the names of monsters that have some kind of monarchy associated with them as well.There is a family that is torn apart. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his wife Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) lose their son in 2014 during the attack. This drives them apart with Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their daughter, staying with her mother. The two of them are in China monitoring what turns out to be an egg containing the larva of Mothra. Things take a turn when some ecological terrorists attack, freeing Mothra and them taking Emma and Madison.She has created a machine that can stop the monsters with a frequency, but it also can make them angry as well. They use this to free what they are calling Monster Zero, who turns out to be King Ghidorah. This draws Godzilla into battle, but the giant lizard cannot defeat him. The military gets involved and makes things much worse. The terrorist also wake up Rodan from his volcano in Mexico. King Ghidorah wakes up the rest of the known kaijus on the planet, altering the plan of this terrorist group. There is also a secret about the three headed dragon that Dr. Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) thinks she has discovered.Now I wanted to go a bit more vague than usual here. Most of what I recapped is literally within the first 15 minutes of the film. The rest is really at the end of the first act and this really is more about the visuals, than what is happening. That's not to say that we don't get an interesting story surrounding it, at least to me.The first thing I really should talk about is I think a lot of people aren't going to consider this a horror film. I personally don't blame you. I do think that kaiju films are definitely horror adjacent for me. The thought of giant monsters destroying cities and killing all of the people that they do is pretty horrific. Now this film does have some pretty bleak moments, it is no where near as dark as the original Godzilla film was.These films are quite interesting to me, as I think quite a bit of them are fun while they can also be cheesy. This one does have some cheesy lines by some of the characters, especially Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Chief Warrant Officer Barnes (O'Shea Jackson Jr.). I can really let that slide to be honest. What they really need to do is balance the giant monsters fighting and the humans' story. I think this one does that well.The human story is interesting in this as the reason the terrorist group is doing what they are doing is because humans are ruining the planet and as a race we are pretty much garbage. As bleak as stating this sounds, I am 100% in agreement with this. I really like that aspect, because there is a duality between trying to save us while we destroy the planet or allow natural progression to happen with the monsters doing what they are made to do.Going along this story, I absolutely love the concept of incorporating mythology into the lore of these monsters. There are some really cool images that are used to associate with them that I was a big fan of. As a lover of mythology, this was definitely an aspect that really hit home for me.This film does have some really good fights between the monsters as well. I personally love the realism of how all of these giant creatures look and that really made me happy to see. I will say here that it is definitely CGI heavy, which actually turned out to be just fine for me. It never took me out of it which was surprising. I think that the effects in this film are great to be honest.As I kind of touched on a couple of paragraphs up, the balance of the kaijus and the humans is an interesting balance you need. I think that writer/director Michael Dougherty does an excellent job of that. Now I know him from Trick 'r Treat which was a horror anthology and Krampus, where he had to balance different aspects for each film. I think that experience really shines through. Being this film was just over 2 hours, it didn't feel like and I was on-board the whole way. I still think this is a bit long as there is a stretch late in the second act/beginning of the third that slows down. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it though and I never actually got bored. The ending is even interesting alluding to the next film that is supposed to be coming. There are some things with the story though that are kind of plot-holes, but nothing to completely ruin the movie.Acting for the film I thought was really good as well. There is such an interesting cast with Chandler, Farmiga and Brown as the broken family. They all did great. I was glad to see that they used Ken Watanabe, who is an amazing Japanese actor as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. I thought he was great too. Zhang, Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, Jackson and the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well. I could go on and on here, but I won't.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. I saw that Bear McCreary did it I was excited. I first saw his name for The Walking Dead. What I really like about this film though, he incorporated music from the original film and other ones in the series while also doing his own thing as well. It really fit and definitely helped enhance the scenes.Now with that said, I might be running off the high of the film, but I really did enjoy it. I liked how they incorporated a solid social message into this film while giving us what we really want. This was brought to life by great acting and writing for sure. There was a bit of cheesiness to it, but I come to expect that. I think the editing of the film keeps the balance, keeps it interesting and the ending was solid. It is CGI heavy, but it looked. The soundtrack of the film was also helped to enhance the scenes as well. I would have liked to know more about some of the monsters that I didn't recognize, but if these films keep having the success I think they will, they definitely could later. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing. I thought it was really good.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","garethvk","29 May 2019","Picking up after the events of the previous film; ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" deals with a world trying to assess what to do with the presence of the giant Titans. The Monarch Corporation wants the creatures studied and has established locales to study the ones they have found currently hibernating. The U.S. Government wants them destroyed as they do not want repeats of the destruction that was previously caused by Godzilla.Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobbie Brown) have developed a device known as Orca that will allow them to communicate with the creatures using specific sonic frequencies.After a successful test under duress; the duo are captured by a ruthless Eco Terrorist group who want to use the giant creatures for their own objectives.
This leads to a chase around the world with Monarch attempting to stop them and with Emma's ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) deeply involved though he is deeply divided as he blames Godzilla for the loss of their son.
When a gigantic creature is freed; Godzilla faces his greatest challenge as there is a race against time to save the world.While the film has some very impressive visual effects, the film drags as aside from a couple of brief encounters; the audience is required to sit through roughly 90 minutes of plodding story to get to the action which is roughly only the last 15-20 minutes of the film.The human characters were very disinteresting and many of the international cast looked at times like they were sleepwalking though their lines as they seemed to have a real lack of passion for what they were given to work with.
The human characters were also very annoying and I found myself hoping that they would be taken out by the creatures as I had no connection to them and they did not inspire any sympathy.While it may possibly appeal to hardcore fans, this was a miss for me as there simply was not enough creature action to counter-balance having to sit through the human characters and plodding plot to get to the good stuff.2.5 stars out of 5","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Phil_M_A_Kerr","2 June 2019","The epic scale of this film is unrelenting. There isn't much room for nuanced human emotion when the fate of the world is being duked over by a dozen monsters the size of mountains, no, mountain ranges.
I thought about the origins of the Gozilla story. Why did the Japanese create this creature whose size was beyond any previously imagined? Two things came to mind. Firstly, I thought that the Japanese experience with earthquakes and tsunamis was the core inspiration. Secondly, the atomic bombs dropped on Japan caused a never before seen level of instantaneous destruction of human life and human endeavour. I like to think that I 'felt' this inspiration during the watching of this film. It is just big, big, big, and more biggerer.","

The sheer amount of Easter eggs and fan service which had me grinning is incredible, (yet knowledgeable Godzilla fans on RT seem to not have noticed any of this) and talk about the likes of fire breathing dragons ><!Anyway the film is awesome. One of my favourite films of all time. Definitely my favourite Godzilla film.The effects are incredible.The music is awesome. You will be grinning from ear to ear at certain points.I actually like the human cast. I liked 2014 Godzilla but did not like the main cast Aaron Tailor Johnson. Did not have those issues here. They play imo a good supporting cast to the main cast you care about - The Titans :)!I'm super excited to see what happens next in the monsterverse.Make sure you stay till the VERY end of the credits scene or for a final scene hinting at wha could be to come ;)!I would also encourage you to write a review also should you watch and enjoy the film.

The 1998 Tristar movie is it's own thing and enjoyable if you are in the mood to have a good time and overlook things.
The Sony cartoon series justifies the movie and did Destroy All Monsters better than the movie, even with original monsters instead of the Toho ones.
Godzilla 2000 through Tokyo SOS is next level amazing.
The Final Wars set leak photos had us all super excited, but then the weird Matrix stuff in the film was weird and unexpected.
Godzilla 2014 was good.
Kong Skull Island was better and easily the best Kong.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","nmn34","3 June 2019","I am no fan of 2014's Godzilla. I found it to be unworthy of the title, focusing on two other terrible monsters while a block of wood runs around. This still suffers from some of its predecessors flaws, but it does make a good step in the right direction.
The characters aren't great. At least most of them. There are two main actors that nailed their roles, a bunch that are entirely unnecessary, and two who never really lived up to their potential. The good are Dr. Chen (Ziyi Zhang) and Dr Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), they both knocked their roles out of the park as Monarch scientists. They fit the plot well, providing much of the exposition and doing so in a way that is believable. In this world of giant monsters and a hollow earth, which is a bit more loaded than they seem to realize, I feel I can trust they know more than me.
Now that they are out of the way, every other person on their team is utter garbage and had no business in the film. This goes especially true for Dr Stanton (Bradley Whitford) and Same Coleman (Thomas Middleditch) who play the exact same role. They are the ""comic relief,"" a phrase I must put in quotes as they are successful at neither of those two words. They never have anything intelligent to add other than to throw out hamfisted lines and be awkward. And to make matters worse, this movie doesn't need such a character. Watanabe and Zhang could have carried this movie even further without their dead weight.
And then there was the unfulfilling characters. The Russel family weren't bad per say, they played their parts well enough but the story didn't feel like it followed through. Emma (Vera Farmiga) played the unenthusiastic villain well and made her daughter's plight more sympathetic. She is ideologically driven but not so lost as to not see the results of what she has done and feel ashamed so you can still empathize for her. Mark (Kyle Chandler) was equally capable as the movie's protagonist. We are learning along side him but he doesn't come across as useless baggage because he provides vital, unorthodox reasoning to any situation. But there should be some emotional weight in Godzilla movies. A character that commits a sacrifice or whose passing should be an emotional low blow, like Daisuke Serizawa's death in the original movie. They try but fail, instead relying on tired Hollywood tropes instead of doing something better with these characters.
Godzilla still needs a slimfast but the main four monsters look great. Mothra is made to look a bit more capable and Rodan, well he never really looked great, but then there is King Ghidorah. He looks like the baddest mother to ever walk the planet. Creating thunderstorms where he stands, hurricanes where he flies, he is a living natural disaster and the greatest threat to everything since Chernobyll. But its even little things about him that make him better, he has personality. Things like the way he glares at people or how his middle head is always picking fights with his left head makes it look like there is much more going on in his head than half the scientists. He is a credit to the special effects team, if only the director had the wherewithal to know where to point the camera in the climactic fight scene. But these are the Japanese monsters, the American originals don't fair all that well. A muto comes back, a spider, a woolly mammoth gorilla hybrid, they don't look so great and probably would have been better off left on the cutting room floor.
In all, I have hope for Godzilla vs King Kong. Maybe they are just needing to make baby steps but the groundwork is there. They just need to know how to swing the bat a little better to knock it out of the park.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kevinxirau","2 June 2019","After years of waiting, ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" has arrived, my most anticipated movie of 2019, perhaps more so than ""Avengers: Endgame"" (I know, blasphemy). It's a continuation of the Monsterverse, a shared universe of kaiju consisting of ""Godzilla"" (2014), ""Kong: Skull Island"" and several prequel comics, and is helmed by Michael Dougherty (Trick o' Treat, Krampus). This one promised to show more of the monster action many people craved from the previous film. Does it achieve this? In short, yes.Plot: Five years after Godzilla's battle in San Francisco, the world now knows of the existence of giant prehistoric ""Titans"" and the organization Monarch is doing everything it can to manage it. However, thanks to an eco-terrorist group, Godzilla's most hated enemy, the 3-headed dragon Ghidorah, is freed from his icy prison and threatens global extinction, reigniting their ancient grudge match. Joining this clash of titans are divine insect Mothra and speedy pterosaur Rodan. What can man do but LET THEM FIGHT!I heard complaints about the humans, but if you ask me they're fine. I grew like the new faces as they, though simplistic, offer both amusing and thoughtful banter with returning actor Ken Watanabe giving the best performance. I also found the conflict of the divorced couple (Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler) and their daughter (Milly Bobbie Brown) interesting with their opposing ideals and character arcs. The eco-terrorists, led by Charles Dance, while not given much screen time, are serviceable as villains and emphasize how the darkness of man overshadows the chaos of beasts, making them a dark foil to Monarch. All in their own ways serve the film's central theme of man needing to maintain balance with nature. I do think one or two characters that could've been cut out, though.Of course, the real stars are the monsters and, boy, are they wonderful. Their relationships, powers, designs, and personalities are true to their Japanese incarnations and the effects that bring them to life are stunningly detailed. There are tons of references to both classic films and the previous Monsterverse entries that eagle-eyed fans will easily spot. Furthermore, the established lore is expanded upon to fascinating areas such as the titans' history with man and mythology while offering room for more exploration. The action scenes up the ante with the monsters literally ripping each other apart in savage fights and worldwide destruction (refreshing locations like Mexico and Boston included), sometimes seen from the humans' POV to truly showcase their size and power. Compared to 2014's darker lighting, the titans' glow and distinct colors make the fights easier to see. The music is a spine-chilling blast, classic themes from past films (particularly Godzilla's and Mothra's) updated and combined with a tribal-style choir chanting the monsters' names to give a sense of awe, wonder, and dread for these giants (about time since previous U.S. adaptations neglected to do this) as well a remake of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Go Go Godzilla"".The humor is really the one thing to me that's hit-or-miss with some jokes being ""meh"" while others did make me chuckle.The team behind this film are true fans who went out of their way to make this a dedicated tribute to the franchise. It made my inner child giddy and I can't wait to see ""Godzilla vs Kong"". By all means, this MUST be seen on the big screen. All hail the King of the Monsters!","

Better performances ( mostly from Chandler )than the last one. A terrific musical score. Jaw dropping CGI effects ( still can't believe the budget wasn't higher ). The best monster fights ever put on film. I've watched nearly every Godzilla movie ever made and this surpasses them on so many levels. Ignore the bad reviews who are clearly out of touch and watch this truly spectacular movie.","

By very cool ideas - and i won't spoil anything, i would call the underwater sequences and its concept - really good sci-fi. This film also features very impressive cast for this kind of movie - they simply could have cast some unknowns and let monsters dominate, but you will see in this movie a lot very good actors. Special effects while not the most impressive of all time, but they were really good and there were a lot of them - i bet this movie costed a fortune.Overall, i enjoyed ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" for its spectacular scope, visuals and some good sci-fi ideas.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","anupapu8","2 June 2019","GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS:- I don't understand , just don't understand why people are not that much into Kaiju (Big Badass Monsters) movies. Both GODZILLA (2014) & KONG: SKULL ISLAND (2017) were awesome movies , but both did just fine at the box office , just fine with the critics and just fine on IMDB page. Right now KING OF MONSTERS is at 49% on Metacritics and 6.9/10 on IMDB. Thats exceptionally low. Also KING OF MONSTERS just opened with lower numbers in comparison to both previous installment , and its actually better then both those awesome movie.But lets just talk about the movie , not the box office numbers. Its literally grand , really grand in its scale. Easily the biggest movie of this summer , even bigger then ENDGAME. By the way, on side note, i liked it more then ENDGAME which had major loopholes in it. Now the writing in this movie is no OSCAR material. But there was no need for that. The writing was just enough to justify the fight scenes. In-fact sometimes it surprises you too. The theme was Dark too. Jokes were evenly spread. Not too much on the nose like some MARVEL movies. The concept of Environmentalism was SPOT ON. Very much makes you think , IS THE VILLAIN ALTOGETHER WRONG ? OR IF THERE IS SOME LOGIC IN HIS/HER ACTIONS ? I totally loved the motives of Human villains. They were never meaningless. Although the character of Charles Dance along with the dialogues given to him as the villain were pretty boring (in-fact i think he was the only boring or bad (whatever u prefer to call it) character in the movie. But the other villain which was almost spoiled by the trailers still i will not say it upfront did a SPOT ON (yes i am gonna use this particular adjective again and again in this review).All the actors have done really fine job , and their characterization were decent too except again Charles Dance and Sally Hawkins to some extent. With Ken Watanabe and Vera Farmiga being the best. Ken Watanabe being one of the character returning from the first movie really got one exceptionally awesome emotional scene. His pain and happiness at the same time went right through my heart, it was almost poetic.Lets talk about the CGI. It was just SPOT ON (yes for the third time now). Not a single bad effect. Not a single scene looked like its was not real. I mean even movies like ENDGAME , INFINITY WAR and AQUAMAN had some scenes where everything looked CGI-ed , but this movie had just the perfect CGI.The creatures were great. I felt RODEN was used for a little less time then what was needed. But whatever he was used for they were great. Specially the Mexico chase, i mean WAOW. The CGI was very creative there. The creatures were shown to have their own brain instead of being just DUMB WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTIONS. When it comes to beauty , nothing can be more beautiful then MOTHRA. U are never gonna get to see a Giant creature as beautiful as her in that much of a size. She was a work of art. But then again , nothing in this movie can be compared to the fight scenes between GODZILLA and GHIDORA . I can see a whole movie without any storyline just these creatures being fighting. it was that great. The MOTION CAPTURE technique used (same as in case of GODZILLA 1 and KONG) really makes a difference with the character of GODZILLA. He felt much more real which makes the CGI SPOT ON (and there goes the 4th time).Small thing to consider, Millie Bobby Brown's character was really good in the movie. Usually this kind of movies have dumb children to taken care of , rescued and always getting in troubled. but her character took some really important and brave steps in the film, becoming one of the most important character in the movie.So basically for me , except the character of Charles Dance , the movie was SPOT ON (i know 5 times is too much). loved almost everything about it. A true blockbuster film with extraordinary action scenes , top notch CGi , decent characters and more than enough writing.Also i watched it on a IMAX SCREEN. And believe me when i say it, U SHOULD DO THE SAME.8.5/10by ANuP APu KuMaR","

King of Monsters raises the bar in both regards, delivering a cliche yet digestible plot gloriously interwoven with some of the best special effects of the year. Indeed, the battles between the titular beast and his gargantuan rivals are simply breathtaking.","

As a truly great film will make you do. Sadness, anger, excitement, happiness and a couple more. Any long time Godzilla fan would be proud of what this movie did.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Carycomic","31 May 2019","And it was well worth sitting through all two hours and fifteen minutes!The movie begins by referencing the 2014 film (with Bryan Cranston) the same way BvS: DAWN OF JUSTICE referenced MAN OF STEEL. With a flashback told from a slightly different point of view. Namely; a pair of Monarch cryptozoologists whose only son became one of the thousands of innocent by-standers killed in the epic struggle between Godzilla and those giant scarabs.Fade in, and its five years later. With the couple now divorced...and the mother having full custody of their late son's younger sister.What follows is more-or-less a spy-fi thriller that has more twists and turns than a gyrating Mothra catepillar. At the same time, it also shows that monsters don't have to be gigantic bugs or lizards with radioactively-based super powers. They can also be (and more often are) so-called ""human beings"" fanatically--or, at the very least, misguidedly--determined to commit the worst crimes imaginable for the so-called ""greater good.""Similar to Hitler ordering the genocide of six million Jews for the ""greater good"" of Germany.For those who just want a good dai-kaiju fight, with state-of-the-art special effects, you'll get your money's worth. But, for those who prefer a little human interest as a subplot to their escapist science fiction? You'll enjoy it, as well.So go see it.","

Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah-Monster Zero are impressive to see. The CGI is incredible. The human storyline and family drama is wasted and unnecessary. At one point in the movie as one parent says goodbye, it's supposed to be an emotional moment but it doesn't land. I'm not sure why these big budget monster movies keep insisting on a human storyline-we've come for the monsters, the spectacle not a lifetime movie. Overall I liked this one a lot, and you will too if your a big Godzilla fan, if you're not, you probably won't get all the details and nuances. As far as monster movies goes, it's worth the watch.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Endless_01","3 June 2019","After the devastation of Godzilla's awakening, years later we meet again but now with the whole team of the main Kaijus in action, Rodan, Mothra, Godzilla and the nemesis, King Ghidora. All ready to face each other in a brutal battle for supremacy among the titans.This movie is the dream of any Godzilla fan come true, a surprising reimagination of the apocalyptic fight between these giants. The action and cinematography are completely synchronized to present epic moments of combat in gigantic proportions. I think in a movie of this kind it's not much about talking about the characters or the script, since what we really want is to see giant monsters fighting, and admit it, we love to see that.Godzilla 2 does it completely, the scenes are fantastic, apocalyptic and full of emotion, above all, is a complete satisfaction for the most veteran fans, the design of each kaiju is incredible and fully respects the originals, using its main structure and sounds, giving us a full ticket to reimagine our childhood once again.I love kaijus, and if you love them too, you will love this movie, because the roar of the king is back, and this time to stay. Long live the king.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","TheBabayaga","2 June 2019","King of the Monsters, at least from a technical perspective, is monstrously epic in scope and sheer destruction. The monsters themselves, especially Mothra, come alive in great detail.Michael Dougherty clearly listened to the viewers who complained about the lack of 'Zilla in the 2014 movie, and to make up for that there is Godzilla galore in this sequel. King of the Monsters isn't as subtle or as restrained as Gareth Edwards' version but here the pace is faster, the action bigger and louder whilst the acting, especially from Ken Watanabe, is competent.The story however, is convoluted and absolutely ludicrous at times, and it was annoying to see characters globe trotting off screen between China and Antarctica and then Mexico and Boston of all places. Not only that but some of the monsters, especially Rodan, were completely wasted despite their prevalence in the trailers. These however, are small niggles.Anyone who wants to watch Godzilla wants to see monsters smashing the hell out of each other and for that you couldn't ask for more with this movie.","

This movie pays tribute to what Toho was known for and that's the fight scenes.
A lot of reviews pointing out all the flaws basically described without realising it, what a classic Godzilla is supposed to be like.
As a long time fan I can safely say that nobody watches Godzilla for the humans. The cheesy plot lines only add to the whole movie and make it a fun and memorable experience.
If you watched this movie expecting some Oscar worthy performances and emotional connections and plot twists, you clearly have no idea what the classic Toho movies were like?Who goes into a Godzilla movie expecting something on the level of Schindler's List?","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","arskhemnanilack","29 May 2019","Right off the bat, this movie takes off quickly from the very beginning of it. Things begin to get going, and it sets up for this basic and simple story. However, everything in the second half completely changes and turns terribly. The story just doesn't make enough sense, with tons of twists and turns which don't suit the situation of the film. The second half is atrocious, and starts throwing characters away left and right and they didn't even make audiences care for any of them. This was easily what brought the movie so far down, and ruined it. They tried to add humor multiple times, but it just never worked and nobody even laughed at any of the jokes. The characters are also very clearly used as story points, and they feel so unrealistic. They also make very dumb decisions, and many things happened that just didn't make any sense or couldn't be possible. For instance, one of the characters had their hand smashed onto by a huge stone building, and then used their hand perfectly fine afterwards. I could go on for days about what's terrible about this movie, but there are a few good things. Millie Bobby Brown's character was maybe the only one that could be semi-cared about. This movie has a huge budget of $200,000,000 and other than spending it on their impeccable all-star cast, it was mainly spent on CGI. This was so clear right from the first few scenes. The CGI was absolutely stunning, and the monsters feels more powerful than ever. Everything looked visually realistic and appealing. I could only name about 2 scenes that had somewhat bad CGI. The monsters are easily the best part of the film without a doubt, they're also taken very seriously. It doesn't make the commin monster movie mistake by using the monsters for dumb humor or anything like that, you can feel the power of these monsters, and when there's action, is when this movie shines the most.","

I won't even mention the immortality of the main characters or the teleportations, or the Sherlock Holmes like skills of the Dad. But the super illogical behavior of the female lead, the 2D personalities and the supe-cringe-worthy dialogues were perfect to throw you off every time.However I didn't go for the human drama, I was ready for a cliché - but not a bad written cliché.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","thisseatofmars","2 June 2019","The 2014 version of Godzilla was not great, but this 2019 take, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, is superb. Many wonderful moments, with some strokes of genius.I know what you're thinking. ""Genius"" may be an overused and often incorrectly used term, like ""epic,"" but I can't think of a better way to describe how the filmmakers gave the three different heads of King Ghidorah their own unique personalities. Ghidorah is the big scary kaiju of the movie, and Godzilla's eternal rival, but he's not just a simple, mindless hydra: the middle head is dominant, the right head is no-nonsense and follows orders, and the left head is something of a ditz, who needs to be put in place. The different personalities is a wonderful quality to give to Ghidorah because it complements his personality and his design. (And, it also makes me think of the three-headed giant from Monty Python's Holy Grail.) The presentation of the monsters is also done with wonderful care, and many sequences, like Rodan waking, and Godzilla arriving with the military (and the girl smiling when seeing him), were excellent.The 2014 Godzilla movie suffered because the movie focused on a bland human and his bland family instead of, you know: the titanic beasts walking the Earth. This 2019 film is far superior because the humans add to the experience rather than get in the way. The cast is generally very good and Charles Dance is here, who is a supreme actor, and his post-credits scene is perfectly delivered.There is one scene that I especially loved: when the humans lure Rodan towards King Ghidorah, and the screen turns black, only for it to flash white, showing Ghidorah in all his serpentine glory, and white light flashing on the Chinese scientist's shocked face. I loved that moment. When I think of this film in the future that moment will be the first of the first images that come to mind. It's moments like these that we go to the movies, and stay with you long after.That said, the humans still sort of get in the way of the action. It's wonderful seeing the monsters; everything, in fact, about the monsters: seeing them appear, seeing their eyes, seeing them fight- even watching them move around is a treat: but the humans get in the way at times, which can annoy. In the climactic battle at the end, the camera is focused on the family more often that I liked, but the battles are all still engrossing and satisfying. Godzilla going nuclear and totalling Ghidorah was great, and he is ushered in via a very tough-cool line, delivered by a human: ""Long live the king.""There's also a scene that irked me: a statue of a soldier falling down. It was very quick, but unpleasant all the same, given the tension around statues of soldiers and historical figures in cities now. However, this film does a good job giving credit to soldiers. The soldiers in this film are competent, hardworking, and brave, and also human: they crack jokes, and one even blesses himself. Also, there's a nice scene between Ken Watanabe, a Japanese actor, and Ziyi Zhang, a Chinese actress, where their characters hug in an emotional and meaningful way. Given the history between their two countries, this moment of peace was especially nice.I love, love, love Godzilla and the whole genre of kaiju movies. I still consider Pacific Rim the absolute finest kaiju film ever made, but Godzilla: King of the Monsters comes second. It's nice to leave the cinema with a smile on my face: I guess not everyone in Hollywood is a twisted pervert with a political agenda (we can only hope). I'm grateful I live in a time where kaiju movies are so well done. ""Let others praise ancient times; I am glad I was born in these.""","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","frobrojkt","3 June 2019","I have been a ""huge"" Godzilla fan for basically as long as I can remember, and I must admit this is arguably one of the best ""Godzilla"" movies ever made!!After the 2014 Legendary film I was admittedly a little apprehensive going into King of the Monsters. But it did not disappoint. There is tons of destruction, tons of monsters, and tons of homages to previous Godzilla films. First, the sounds all the kaiju made were spot on, albeit modernized. The visual eye candy is constant. The creature design was truly ah inspiring.
Bear McCreary's score is absolutely incredible!! Full of homages to original themes by Ikufube (probably spelled wrong).
If you go to this movie expecting a kaiju smashfest overflowing with homages and fan service then this is the movie for you!!Now for my critiques: The story IS lacking and a little disjointed. The acting is pretty good, although there are a couple poorly delivered lines. You never quite fully understand the motivations behind characters. My overall feelings about most of the critiques on this page are justified. However, this leads me to my main point. This is a kaiju movie.. what are you honestly expecting ? Are you expecting academy award winning performances ? Are you expecting a Christoffer Nolan masterpiece? No, or at least you shouldn't be. The hard core critics of this film are being critical for the sake of being critical. This is a monster movie, you are going to get lots of monsters, explosions, and creature violence. That is kinda the point.Anyway, long story short, this is a flawed movie from a critical stand point. There are weak points, and strong points. But again I reiterate the point, THIS IS A MONSTER FILM!! if you are going into this film to be entertained and have a smashingly great time, then please go and I think you will have fun. But if you are expecting something more from this film (that no kaiju film in the history of cinema has delivered btw) then I think you should avoid this film.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","sheridan-turner","31 May 2019","Finally......got it right!Godzilla 2014 was pretty good but a bit boring....and had more people talking and not enough action.Godzilla: King of the Monsters more than made up for that!It was action packed....and it had heart. This time the story made sense, and the people seemed to be in tune with what was going on. No stupid love story trying to appeal to your emotions.I liked how certain scenes paid homage to the Japanese Godzilla movies by using some of the same references and music. He was pretty bad ass at the final fight scene. It reminded me of the Japanese fight with ""Destroyah"", if you saw that one. For true Godzilla fans, you will hear and recognize many clues and references. Have to say though, Mothra was a bit small if you ask me.
The military were decently portrayed, but some things were a bit off. For example, you won't see a Full Bird Colonel running around like a Sergeant leading a strike team into a hot zone. Not typically anyway.All in all, my wife stayed awake for the entire move, so that says a lot!Great job guys and gals!!!Cannot wait to see the next installment!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","JamesIan2021","31 May 2019","The film could've chopped out 10 minutes of mostly exposition, removed 5 or so characters and relegated the soldiers to just background characters, as King of the Monsters does slightly suffer from overstuffing from time to time, but everything about this mighty sequel defines big, dumb blockbuster fun. I was munching on my popcorn like a little kid every time something big happened, and that may sound vague but I'm sure you can guess what I mean.This movie is basically at 130 minute light show, a blast of cinematic spectacle with dozens of mouth-watering shots that could easily be your next computer wallpaper. Most the performances work, especially Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler, but let's face it, we're here for monumental destruction and titan smackdowns, and boy do you get those!Godzilla is fully-realised, with character and presence, and he roars about 15 times here and it made me cheer with giddy abandon, I turn into a wide-eyed kid watching monster movies and this one had me jaw dropped and blown away consistently with the phenomenal battles involving the menacing Ghidorah, the deadly Rodan and the beautiful Mothra, plus other briefly seen titans that each have a distinct look and threat about them.The set design is so cool, it reminded me of Roland Emmerich's 2012, in that these governments and giant companies own groovy high tech facilities, epic ships, complete with expensive monitors and satellites, it's all very cheesy and B-movie but it made the movie even more entertaining in that there's thought put into every scene and environment, and the aesthetics and mood of Godzilla's hidden home in hollow earth added some much-needed atmospherics to the film.The finale of this film almost rivals the awe and chaos of the 2014 Godzilla flick, and I absolutely loved the relatively lengthy unbroken shots of the humans running through destroyed Boston as Ghidorah and Godzilla beat each other up whilst Rodan and Mothra go at it! It's explosion and action movie heaven, my ears were ringing by the end of this movie and I left exhausted in the best possible way.Now it's the wait for Godzilla vs Kong, this franchise needs to keep going this good!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","annekehensley","3 June 2019","Despite having never been TOO big of a Godzilla fan in my life, at least not to the extent of many people, this movie delivered a good time. I feel like it was a major step up from Godzilla (2014), which to me was already pretty damn good of a movie. This one was by no means perfect, but it was dramatic and intense and had scenes that made me smile, frown, jump a little in my seat, and leave me begging to see more.
The CGI graphics are PHENOMENAL. The team clearly knew what they were doing, everything was recorded well and seemed so real. A movie that felt like even the staff had fun making those scenes. The actors were great too, though I feel that anyone will be more attached to the titanic monsters that capture the spotlight more than anyone else.
If you're thinking of going to see it, then do. If you like Godzilla, or if you even just like loud, well-designed action movies with fantasy monsters, you HAVE to see this one.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","capcanuk","1 June 2019","Let's start with some simple ground rules:
1) if you don't like monster movies, do NOT go see this film. You won't like it. It's... a monster movie.
2) if you're looking for subtle drama, interpersonal relationships, depth and realism worthy of an Oscar, do NOT go see this movie. it's not that kind of film, it's a MONSTER MOVIE.
3) If you're a pretentious snob who only likes slow-burn foreign, subtitled films, well, I think you can fill in the rest of what I was going to write.On to the review (I will attempt not to have any spoilers):Despite what some others, who gave the film low ratings, wrote, the performances are solid all the way through. I would even say that they are better than Samuel L. Jackson's scene-chewing in Kong: Skull Island (gotta admit, however, that he was a great ""villain"" in that movie).Storywise, this is very much like all the TOHO Gojira films, in the sense that the stories tend to be a bit convoluted. You go into a Godzilla movie expecting a certain degree of ""cheese"" in the whole affair. But the American versions don't quite go as far with it, which is a nice change of pace. They treat the material with a bit more respect than expected.For those who complained about the paucity of Godzilla in the 2014 film (it actually had more Godzilla screen-time than the 1954 original version), well, this film makes up for it with LOTS of monster time on screen.
It also really helps that these are four of the most iconic monsters from this particular monsterverse.Effects: Both a pro and a con for me. The effects were absolutely breathtaking for the most part. Yes, Mothra is absolutely awe-inspiring. Ghidora is amazingly well rendered. Godzilla is perfect. But for some odd reason, Rodan (by the way, always my favourite monster from the TOHO collection) is less convincing. I don't know what exactly it was about him, but he had that ""man in a rubber suit"" look despite being entirely CGI.Another minor complain has to do with the way the monsters were filmed. Where the 2014 film succeeded like no other by really leaving us with a sense of the MASS of these monsters, In G:KotM there were too many parallel shots, scenes filmed from ""monster head level"" which had the disadvantage of drawing the viewer away from the scale of the monsters. You really had less of a sense of the massive sizes involved because you were too close to them, too removed from a human-scale point of view. At least, it felt this way to me. Not every scene, most were perfect, but a few, and unfortunately, most were in the climactic final battle sequence.Very, very minor spoiler here: two major characters die (it's a monster movie, SOMEONE has to die, right?), and my only complaint is that not enough time was given to the audience to really ingest the impact of those two moments. Had the film tacked on an extra 10-15 minutes, and allowed us a bit more time to ""feel"", at least to me, it would have been better.Bear McCreary's score to the film was fun, and included references to musical themes from a few of the original TOHO movies (Mothra's theme in particular, which has a very emotional impact). And of course, the original Godzilla theme which has tremendous impact and raises the excitement level. It's not as original a score as that for the 2014 film (which SHOULD have been one of the ""Best Score"" Oscar contenders), but I was very impressed that McCreary was able to pull off such a huge, symphonic, and EFFECTIVE score for the film.I saw the film on an IMAX screen, no 3D. And I was blown away. It is definitely meant to be seen on a huge screen.
Somehow, I suspect that the 3D element is probably superfluous, so I would not say ""you have to see it in 3D"".This is a fun film, a huge, loud, exciting film. And for fans of the original TOHO movies, it's loaded with winks and nods and allusions. There's even a major plot point from the 1954 Gojira that becomes an integral part of the action in this film.It's beautifully shot, a BIT on the dark side (and those who complained that the film was too dark MAY have the 3D to blame for that), and the colour palette is a tiny bit too restricted for my taste, but well worth watching anyways, and eventually a definite addition to my Bluray collection.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","LoboKurg","15 December 2023","The crutch to all these films is always all the people. Side characters constantly saturate these movies with needlessly crappy and convoluted side plots, bad scripts, and terrible decisions. Adding more military elements to this film didn't help much either, because its cringely apparent the director had zero knowledge of the subject matter and didn't bother to source an advisor. As a result, we see clashes between human factions that are equally idiotic, and we get shots of rifle optics that are clearly just camera overlays, among other lazy oversights that distract from the rest of the movie.At the end of the day, we eventually get what everyone came to see, a monster fight. ""Let them fight"" couldn't be more on the mark, and the director should have taken a lesson from that line.","

Thank goodness somebody is still make B movies for people to laugh at in 50 years.Godzilla? Godawful!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","gregthmann","29 May 2019","After watching a few subtitled Japanese Godzilla films and loving them, I was keen as mustard to see the 1994 Godzilla film and felt betrayed with the American handling of this franchise! Move on 20 years and a significant step up and a real homage to the franchise was paid but still lacked enough ""Wow"" time with the monsters fighting (still a great film and good acting but missing the budget perhaps?)Move to King of the monsters and it is OMFG time!!! It starts out a little slow but does the right thing in character building. Then it is showtime and MAN, I was not disappointed at all. It genuinely felt like I was watching gigantic monsters fighting and destroying building. I was taken back to Pacific Rim and how big they looked but this does it even better in my opinion.Without giving spoilers, if like me, you enjoy a good 'Giant monsters fighting film', you will not be let down at all. Sound is amazing also and well worth watching in IMAX. Ohhh and as a heads up... Stay til the very end credits for a Marvel-esque treat!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","smilyst","1 July 2021","From reading other reviews it sounds like they got some of the philosophical aspects of Goszilla correct, but that doesn't excuse such a crappy final product.The human drama was so poorly written, yet it dominated the entire film. The writing was terrible! Why was the crappy drama 70% of the film (and I usually like drama) when this was supposed to be a monster fight movie??? The monster fights were probably only 20 minutes of this 2 hour movie. There were 17 monsters, and only 20 minutes of fighting??? How do you fail that much?I consider story to be the most important aspect of any film. And that is why this movie was such trash. I wasn't expecting any story, and that would have been WAY better! The story/drama was so poorly written. The directing was so poor. I feel sorry for the actors who had to work with such a piss poor director.Conclusion: Go watch Pacific Rim. You will hate yourself less afterwards.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","dmcoleman-23036","5 June 2019","... Something Hollywood gets wrong again and again when they attempt a godzilla revamp. The hammy supporting crew are given wayyy too much airtime to blandly expose the ridiculous plot of this film, and it is excrutiating in parts.
Why is EVERY female character rocking the ice cold, androgynous thing? Is that what happens when humanity is suffering kaiju induced extinction? Is it just me? Probably.
Again, why, do they bring back two of the main characters from the last film, only to pointlessly kill them both off? You have to assume the actors had a say in that, who can blame them.The acting isnt the only painful part of this movie. The visual effects in the early sequences are blatantly sharknado quality, obscured by darkness, shaky camerawork and ""weather conditions"" similar to a poorly tuned 1970's analog TV. I could barely see what was happening and I'm certainly not the only one.The last saving grace was probably the final 15 minutes, where the beasts finally took centre stage, seemingly directed by a different eye, someone who understands and loves the source material. Half the budget must have been spaffed on the end battle alone, hence the incoherent mess we're made to suffer through to get to that point.I love Godzilla. But the big guy clearly doesn't translate to modern cinema. Please, no more. Keep it to comic books and retire this incarnation.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Sabaher","2 June 2019","I think this movie probably delivers most and the best monster destruction. We get this whole gallery of monsters from the Godzilla universe rising from the ground and these titans battle it out starting early in the film and all the way to the end. It moves at a nice brisk pace because of that. It develops the sense of urgency early on in the film involving the human subplot and then in the first half of the film the monsters are unleashed and destruction begins. As it is a Godzilla movie Godzilla gets in the action at the beginning, middle, and a big fight at thre end of the film. We get to explore him a little bit more as a character. I also appriciated that this film dove into the deep end of mythology of this world with monsters being around for a while, ancient civilisations, MONARCH and all of the many different bases throughout the globe. There's a bunch of things about this film that I really enjoy. We spend a lot of time with our human characters, but they're all played by great actors that can deliver really ridiculus exposition and stupid lies in a way that it sounds kind of convincing, but that leads to our big problem here is that the scrips is not good. There's just so many holes inside of the logic. The characters are all basically a job and a single personality trait. That's all of them. They just got a great actor to try to perform that, but there's just no depth to anyone. Also the monster action, though there's plenty of it, is shot so often in close-up or from the perspective of humans that it doesn't have the right effect that it should. It's not as exciting as it should be even though there's a lot of it. So this is a movie that is very frustrating because of the mistakes it made were, even though it's got a great cast and plenty of monster action, which is what we go to the movies like this to see","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","CrookedNose94","4 November 2019","Maybe not, but ranks very high on the list. Godzilla: King of The Monsters is basically just a reaction video where many different actors are shown in close-up shots while they witness unfathomably large creatures topple hundreds of buildings and kill thousands. Now THAT'S filmmaking.Ask yourself: Do you like multi-trillion-dollar underwater mega facilities? Multi-trillion-dollars of super jets and aircraft? Do you like corny CGI in every imaginable shot possible? Do you like scripts that are preformed like they were written by ten-year-old? If so, this is DEFINITELY the movie for you.One of my biggest problems with movies like this is that we've seen all of this happen before in action movies. Too formulated!The ""film"" (animation) is:-50% Reaction shots
-10% Actual god-sized monsters fighting in slow-mo
-10% Super unrealistic ideals and moral compasses
-10% Stranger Things
-10% Nods toward another sequel (Godzilla Vs. Kong)
-7% Actually cool action sequences
-3% Mexican standoffs.Oh yeah and 1% logic. Can't forget the logic!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","chester129","1 February 2020","I realize this is a Godzilla movie and he is the king, but my favorite is Mothra and she is the queen! She is the first 'monster' shown - in her larva form. But she is such a legend, even in this form. When the men try to stop her, she kicks their asses.Mothra should have been in this movie MUCH more. Really, she isn't in it very much. She has a beautiful moment helping a 'dead' Godzilla. As amazing and beautiful as she is, she also is a fighter. She is the one that takes down Rodan...in a truly amazing battle. My fave thing of her is her expressions...she shows when she is mad as hell!!!Of course, my least fave moment is when she is killed by Ghidorah. But even in death, she powers up Godzilla. If you watch at the end, the news reports that a mysterious egg appeared. So.... let's hope she resurfaces!!!The movie is amazing. I know it sounds pathetic, but I was very emotional watching it the first time. Just watching the monsters go at it, it was such a beautiful moment! Godzilla was ok, he is not my fave. Ghidorah was ok....I truly didn't want Ghidorah to be defeated, but the post credit scene makes me think he will be back. I love Rodan...especially when he first appears. As much as I loved him, I mentioned how satisfying it was to see Mothra take him down.Many people have a problem with the 'humans.' I am a huge Kyle Chandler fan, so I loved every scene he was in. Millie Bobby Brown was overhyped! She was ok, but nothing special. Vera Farmiga was ok, her character was hard to figure out. Ken Watanabe was a highlight. I was drawn to every word he said...and his 'ultimate' moment was amazing! And I suppose I should mention Charles Dance...his character was perfectly evil (but I never watched Game of Thrones, so he was just another guy).So, ultimately my assessment of this movie is....it is perfection. It's one of my top 3 movies of the year. The monsters: Godzilla, Ghidorah, Rodan and of course Mothra....they were the stars. Other monsters appeared at the end...but they weren't important to the plot. Some say it has bad writing, but it is a monster movie....accept it for that and you will be happy!!One last thing I will say....the trailers showed WAY TOO MUCH. There were 3 trailers (or maybe 4), but they showed too much. The first 2 were great. But the last trailer actually showed Mothra getting killed. I mean, come on.... why show such a big moment in a trailer?!? Show some, show a lot, but don't show everything!!","

and all his pals were laying waste to most of urban Japan. Godzilla originally
a villain monster became a leader to other of these titanic creatures as they
battled Ghidrah the hydra head bad guy from outer space.Ghidrah's back too and he and Godzilla slug it out in of all places Boston with
Fenway Park as ground zero.There's a human cast too, but like in the Japanese films they take second place
to the computer graphic generated big guys.It's big and it's awesome, but doesn't have the same sense of fun as the Japanese created creatures destroying those cardboard sets.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","shawneofthedead","29 May 2019","THE LOW-DOWN: With Marvel raking in the cash and plaudits after creating the world's most epic cinematic universe, every studio that can thread movies together - however tenuously - is hopping on the bandwagon. And so we have Godzilla II: King Of The Monsters: the third installment in Legendary Pictures' MonsterVerse, following Godzilla (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017). It's easily the most ambitious film yet, uniting several classic critters straight out of Godzilla lore and finding pretty much any excuse to have them fight one another. The final result is both bold and bonkers - good and bad, often in the very same moment.THE STORY: Monsters break stuff, including people. It's a fact of life that the broken Russell family must deal with after Godzilla's epic battle leaves downtown San Francisco in ruins. Grieving and newly sober, Mark (Kyle Chandler) stalks wolf packs in another part of the world. Emma (Vera Farmiga), his ex-wife, continues to work on the Orca, a machine they created together that can emit soundwaves capable of calming or infuriating Godzilla-scale monsters. Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their precocious daughter, is caught in between - especially when Emma's decision to use the Orca sets off a chain of monstrous events that could lead to the end of the world as we know it.THE GOOD: The concept at the heart of Godzilla II, quite frankly, is off-the-wall wacky - so bold and audacious and weird that you have to give director/co-screenwriter Michael Dougherty some credit for effort, even if his execution of it is somewhat lacklustre. This is no mere story of monsters raining mayhem down upon mankind. Instead, the film moves its mythology quite firmly into the realm of faith; Godzilla, the film suggests, is as much god as monster. It's actually quite remarkable to see a mainstream blockbuster movie embrace - rather than shy away from - religious iconography, folding in theologies and environmental philosophies from Greek myth to Thanos. As such, Godzilla and his arch-nemesis, King Ghidorah (a three-headed Hydra-esque dragon beast), aren't just having their version of a bar-room brawl - their earth-shaking clash is a battle for the survival of humanity.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: It's a shame that the film as a whole can't keep up with its high-concept ideas. The writing ranges from inspired to insipid, with character motivations dancing ridiculously back and forth - dictated mostly by the rather demented plot. As a director, Dougherty exhibited some skill with subversive comedy in cult horror flick Krampus, but very little of that is evident here. It's not just about sacrificing soul for scale - Dougherty occasionally struggles with telling such a massive story in visual terms. Some of the film's action sequences are so choppy as to be downright confusing. It doesn't help that Dougherty's preferred aesthetic tends towards the grey and grim, which makes it even harder to figure out just what is going on while monsters are duking it out in frustratingly murky lighting.THE MONSTER MASH: The first Godzilla film in the franchise suffered for shoving its titular monster into the background, having him play second fiddle to human characters who weren't all that well-written to begin with. Godzilla II tries to rectify that, somewhat, by flinging so many monsters at the screen that you'd be almost glad to get back to the human drama after a while. Apart from Godzilla and Ghidorah, fans will be glad to see old-school Toho favourites like Mothra and Rodan in action too. (If they could actually see them, that is. Seriously - the monsters are beautifully rendered, but the bruise-toned lighting does them no favours.)GOD(ZILLA)-LEVEL CASTING: If Dougherty learned one thing from his predecessor, Gareth Edwards, it's the importance of casting a bunch of top-notch character actors in an otherwise barmy creature feature. Veteran performers like Oscar nominee Farmiga, West Wing alumnus Whitford and Charles Dance (that's Tywin Lannister to you) reel off awkward exposition and pseudo-scientific claptrap (""bio-acoustics"", ""the Oxygen Destroyer"") like it's actual real human dialogue. It's quite remarkable to see Friday Night Lights' Coach Eric Taylor in action anti-hero mode, but Chandler - just as Bryan Cranston did in the 2014 film - brings an everyman weight to a character whose narrative arc is muddled, to say the least. The MVP here, though, is Brown. She brings to Madison the same soulful blend of toughness and tenderness that made her such a breakout star in Netflix's Stranger Things.RECOMMENDED? It depends. Godzilla II is a hot mess... but it's a fascinating hot mess, and surprisingly fun to watch and even think about.","

Story is nothing, Why some movies need to watch in theaters, this movie is best example for that questions. 3D scenes almost zero. Still movie is holding its ground. You cannot remove your eyes from the screen. Very less dialogue. Full pack of actions from starting. Kids are literally shocked with such giant creatures in screen. I am very glad that i spent my 2 hours in such exciting way. Go with your family especially with kids, just enjoy the movie.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","grantpaulsen","2 June 2019","This was the worst Godzilla movie I've ever seen. This film has the dumbest, stupidest, and illogical human characters I've ever seen in a film, who also take up 80% of the runtime, and because of that it doesn't feel like there was more monster fights than there were in the first one. The writing sucks, the script is worthless, the dialogue is laughably bad, the directing is incomprehensible, the character motives are completely warped, and the monster fights were underwhelming to be honest. On top of that the film is incredibly boring, so that makes it completely unwatchable. This is probably the worst movie I've seen so far this year.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","nitsua125","30 May 2019","Firstly, I should state that I went into this film with no real expectations of any sort. I found the first movie watchable but not terrible. This sequel however, was awful.Don't get me wrong the effects are good, and there's plenty of action. That's where the positives end. The plot is contrived, messy, and manages to shoehorn in every cliche known to man.(spoilers from hereon in)One thing that really irritated me was the 'climate disaster' subplot, which almost feels like it was put in as an afterthought. If anything it trivialises the issue, which should not just be used as a plot device. The film is bloated, jumps around too much, and would probably have been served better across multiple movies, although I definitely won't be watching further instalments.The acting is bad, you can almost tell everyone agrees it's a poorly written script. From Kyle Chandlers 'reluctant and troubled hero' to Vera Fermiga's 'questionable motives for the greater good'.Even supporting characters get to play with cliches. Ken Watanabe's character decides to sacrifice himself, due to multiple convenient plot holes allowing the protagonists to go and blow up Godzilla's underwater house with a nuke. Charles Dance is good when you see him, but his character disappears without explanation during the third act.Millie Bobby Brown also puts in a good performance, I like her as an actor but her skills are wasted here. Her character manages to run from an outpost to a football stadium in 5 minutes, which then conveniently happens to be right next to her house, somehow miraculously still standing after the giant alien kaiju destroys everything around it.Yeah, it turns out the main antagonist of the movie is an ancient alien that has been frozen for millennia... because why the hell not? By the time that revelation came I was just surprised no one had woken up to find out it was all a terrible dream. I kind of wish it was a dream, then I wouldn't have wasted 2 hours of my life.I've never walked out of a film, but this time I was very close. To conclude, a very strong contender for worst film of 2019.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","hissss1","29 May 2019","This movie gets everything right I wanted it to get right. The story, once again, focusses rather heavily on humans, but this time around Godzilla gets the attention, screen time and level of intimidation he deserves, just like his titan friends. From monster designs to fights, there are more than just a few memorable, extremely well presented moments. And when the Godzilla theme plays and you are allowed to see the king in all his glory, it's actually very touching.The effects are hit or miss on occasion, but for 90% of the time your eyes will be fed with beauty. Sadly, there was rarely a shot which showed all monsters fighting at the same time from an acceptable distance, and pretty much every battle started with the movie instantly going back to humans.
There are a few cringeworthy moments when it comes to dialogue and story, and these make you believe you are watching a movie which in part heavily tries to appeal to children, though that's not necessarily a bad thing since Godzilla's target audience were children for decades. It's quite often a back and forth between a witty 90s movie and a try to move onward.If you are a person who heavily enjoyed the 2014 film, you may have a few problems with this one. The fights are faster and way more chaotic and Godzilla himself can rarely be fully appreciated outside of the scenes solely dedicated to him, thankfully those scenes are outstanding.What fans wanted was more, way more Godzilla, and this is what we got. If you just want to see Godzilla slapping big monsters while everyone around acknowledges his glory, this is exactly the movie for you. None of the negative points I raised truly matter if you can leave the cinema with a smile on your face, because the movie gave you exactly what you asked for. They listened, they genuinely tried and they succeeded and the outcome should be celebrated. It's a great, faithful film about everyone's favorite oversized monster.","

In this film you can never see any creature clearly,there either obscured by smoke,fire,ice,clouds all water.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ICMooVees","1 July 2019","There is a great challenge to get the size, proportion and perspective of humans, buildings, etc. to fit well within a screen at the same time as giant creatures or robots (Pacific Rim). And I think it is capturing that perspective and realism on the screen that makes such movies a good draw and success. G:KoM does accomplish that very well. And with the latest in CGI it gets better each time. Just like PR, there is so much eye-candy to be enjoyed such as the surface detail of the titans and the related choreography of the combatants. I've watched, I believe, nearly every giant monster movie. And given the budgets, era's of production with the available special FX of the times, quite a few are very enjoyable while some are just laughable junk. While this was a great movie, it did suffer a bit from the human drama distractions and plot lines. Otherwise if your are a fan like me, this is a must-see on the big screen!","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","kbrenkb","1 February 2021","Ok so, I'd like to preface this by saying I have absolutely ZERO issues with women in the military, BUT (yes there's always a but), in the case of this film you have a female colonel, who clearly would not be able to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test (and by the way a woman who is wayyyyy too young to be a colonel), who is also taking tactical control in a high threat environment?! I'm sorry but a colonel is not going to be on the ground with her troops, and any colonel who has been deemed worthy of command with an organisation such as the fictional Monarch, is going to be the best of the best of the best - meaning smart as a whip, fearless and physically fit.
Look I don't care that they cast a woman in the role, I just think someone else should've won out on this one.. Thinking maybe Angela Basset? Halle Berry? Jada Pinket-Smith? All in the correct age range for the rank of colonel and all seemingly physically fit and strong. I think any one of them would've been far more believable.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","theshadow1963","3 June 2019","If you've never seen a Godzilla film before, or have only a passing acquaintance with the King of the Monsters, then you can thoroughly enjoy Godzilla: King of the Monsters for its epic action, well crafted internal mythology and tense human drama.
But if you are a fan of Japan's most famous export, if you grew up watching stuntmen in rubber suits battling during Saturday afternoon Creature Features, you owe it to yourself to see this movie ASAP. It is so chock full of Easter eggs, shout outs and references to the 65-year history of Japan's ""kaiju eiga"" franchise, this reviewer lost count before the first hour was up.
The film picks up five years after Godzilla destroyed the MUTOs in San Francisco, leaving the city in ruins (because, let's face, whether he's friend or foe, Godzilla is the patron saint of collateral damage). The world is now aware of the presence of unstoppable giant monsters called ""Titans"" and the debate rages on as to whether destroy them (assuming a method can be found) or accept them as a force of nature and try to adapt to their presence. Monarch, the agency that has been studying the Titans for 40 years, is under pressure from the U.S. government to help find a way to destroy the Titans, and under attack from a paramilitary outfit led by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) who wants to co-opt the Titans for his own purposes.
The central characters are scientists Mark and Emma Russell and their daughter Madison. The Russells' son was killed in the battle between Godzilla and the MUTOs. Now, Mark wants to see all Titans exterminated while Emma wants to understand them, to which end she has created a device that allows rudimentary communication with Titans. Alan kidnaps Emma and Madison to steal the device and release the three-headed Monster Zero (King Ghidorah) which leads to an all-out mass emergence of Titans, with only Godzilla and Mothra willing to defend humanity from extermination.
The monster battles are suitably epic; clearly the makers of this movie heard the complaints from fans that their last Godzilla film didn't have enough Godzilla in it. Godzilla himself is re-imagined, displaying more intelligence and energy than before. And Mothra and Rodan have never looked so badass.
There are some minor snags in the plot. It's never made clear what the relationship is between Monarch and U.S. Army. Monarch has military hardware and personnel at its disposal and autonomous control over them, but there are multiple references to an ongoing conflict between Monarch and the U.S. government, which wants to use Monarch's data to destroy the Titans. Jonah Alan's motivations are never made clear: is he trying to profit from weaponizing Titans or is he a nihilist who wants to trigger a global genocide? Zhang Ziyi playing twins comes completely out of left field (although the revelation that both their mother and materal grandmother also had twins is clever tip of the hat to the Shobajin, the little twin fairies that appear in the Mothra movies). And the movie also has an ongoing issue with depicting action scenes when the human characters and the Titans are on the same stage. The Titans create so much damage, tearing up the landscape and tossing around mountains of debris, the humans often seem to be swallowed up in the swirling mass of CGI effects.
Besides the four Toho monsters, there are numerous other Titans seen in small doses, opening the franchise to multiple more sequels. Strangely, although Kong and Skull Island are mentioned multiple times, neither appears in this movie.
Ken Watanabe is amazing as Dr. Serizawa, now leader of Monarch and the only man who seems to fully understand the big-picture of the Titan presence. His character is there to be Mr. Exposition, but his performance is that of what a Godzilla fan would choose to be if he could enter the film as a character.
The shout-outs to other kaiju movies abound: from the code name of ""Monster Zero"" applied to Ghidorah and his origins, to the use of a weapon called the Oxygen Destroyer, to the sound effects for Rodan's and Mothra's roars being amped-up versions of their original sounds, to the use of the original Godzilla and Mothra musical themes in the soundtrack.
In conclusion, Godzilla, King of the Monsters is magnificent monster epic that may be remembered and the greatest giant monster movie ever.","

I think most critics are wrong about this movie, it has a great plot, and not all fights are obscured by rain. Godzilla is also actually in his movie!

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Robert_duder","31 May 2019","I admit for some reason I'm not a fan of the monster genre. This recent universe they've been building has been okay but nothing that blew me away by any means. They all seem the same to me and offer up the same sort of titan battles and mass destruction. However, as popcorn flicks they are reasonably entertaining. I will say I thought the cast of Godzilla: KOM was far superior to the 2014 Godzilla cast in many ways. Vera Fermiga, Millie Bobby Brown and Kyle Chandler were all excellent in their roles. I wasn't sure this would be the right break out vehicle for Brown from Stranger Things but I think this will do it because she really is great and steals the show in many ways. Ken Watanbe is also very good in a smaller supporting role. The big problem with this genre of film is believability and I know that lots of movies require a suspension of belief but monster films don't address the ""monster"" in the room in that if this were real, no one would ever survive but the heroes always do unless they make a stupid decision not to. The monsters lay waste to each other, the story is decent, the acting is solid and it fits into the Universe it created so it delivers everything it promises to. 7/10","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Reviews_of_the_Dead","30 May 2019","Now anyone who knows me and my film tastes knows that I loved Godzilla films growing up. I tended to watch the same ones over and over again, but I ended up seeking all of them out as an adult. I remember seeing the 1998 remake with my father and sister in the theater. I enjoyed the most recent remake and the talk of this universe they were building. When hearing about this film, I had to see it. I thankfully got to see it early as a surprise showing was happening at my theater. The synopsis is the crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah.This film starts off back in 2014. In San Francisco when Godzilla was on a rampage there. Since then, the organization Monarch has been seeking out the large monsters to keep track of and monitor them. Their goal to keep them from waking up, but the military is considering just exterminating them to prevent the loss of human life. I should point out here that it is an interesting nod to all of the names of monsters that have some kind of monarchy associated with them as well.There is a family that is torn apart. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his wife Dr. Emma (Vera Farmiga) lose their son in 2014 during the attack. This drives them apart with Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), their daughter, staying with her mother. The two of them are in China monitoring what turns out to be an egg containing the larva of Mothra. Things take a turn when some ecological terrorist attack, freeing Mothra and the them taking Emma and Madison.She has created a machine that can stop the monsters with a frequency, but it also can make them angry as well. They use this to free what they are calling Monster Zero, who turns out to be King Ghidorah. This draws Godzilla into battle, but the giant lizard cannot defeat him. The military gets involved and makes things much worse. The terrorist also wake up Rodan from his volcano in Mexico. King Ghidorah wakes up the rest of the known kaijus on the planet. There is also a secret about the three headed dragon that Dr. Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) thinks she has discovered.Now I wanted to go a bit more vague than usual here. Most of what I recapped is literally within the first 15 minutes of the film. The rest is really at the end of the first act of the film. Being this film officially hasn't had any official showings as of the time of writing this, I wanted to make sure that if anyone read this, the film wouldn't be ruined for you.The first thing I really should talk about is I think a lot of people aren't going to consider this a horror film. I personally don't blame you. I do think that kaiju films are definitely horror adjacent for me. The thought of giant monsters destroying cities and killing all of the people that they do is pretty horrific. Now this film does have some pretty bleak moments, it is no where near as dark as the original Godzilla film was.These films are quite interesting to me, as I think quite a bit of them are fun while they can also be cheesy. This one does have some cheesy lines by some of the characters, especially Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford). I can really let that slide to be honest. What they really need to do is balance the giant monsters fighting and the humans' story. I think this one does that well.The human story is interesting in this as the reason the terrorist group is doing what they are doing is because humans are ruining the planet and as a race we are pretty much garbage. As bleak as stating this sounds, I am 100% in agreement with this. I really like that aspect, because there is a duality between trying to save us while we destroy the planet or allow natural progression to happen with the monsters doing what they are made to do.Going along this story, I absolutely love the concept of incorporating mythology into the lore of these monsters. There are some really cool images that are used to associate with them that I was a big fan of. As a lover of mythology, this was definitely an aspect that really hit home for me.This film does have some really good fights between the monsters as well. I personally love the realism of how all of these giant creatures look and that really made me happy to see. I will say here that it is definitely CGI heavy, which actually turned out to be just fine for me. It never took me out of it which was surprising. I think that the effects in this film are great to be honest.As I kind of touched on a couple of paragraphs up, the balance of the kaijus and the humans is an interesting balance you need. I think that writer/director Michael Dougherty does an excellent job of that. Now I know him from Trick 'r Treat which was a horror anthology and Krampus, where he had to balance different aspects for each film. I think that experience really shines through. Being this film was just over 2 hours, it didn't feel like and I was on-board the whole way. The ending is even interesting alluding to the next film that is supposed to be coming.Acting for the film I thought was really good as well. There is such an interesting cast with Chandler, Farmiga and Brown as the broken family. They all did great. I was glad to see that they used Ken Watanabe, who is an amazing Japanese actor as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. I thought he was great too. Zhang, Whitford and the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well. I could go on and on here, but I won't.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. I saw that Bear McCreary did it I was excited. I first saw his name for The Walking Dead. What I really like about this film though, he incorporated music from the original film and other ones in the series while also doing his own thing as well. It really fit and definitely helped enhance the scenes.Now with that said, I might be running off the high of the film, but I really did enjoy it. I liked how they incorporated a solid social message into this film while giving us what we really want. This was brought to life by great acting and writing for sure. There was a bit of cheesiness to it, but I come to expect that. I think the editing of the film keeps the balance, keeps it interesting and the ending was solid. It is CGI heavy, but it looked. The soundtrack of the film was also helped to enhance the scenes as well. I would have liked to know more about some of the monsters that I didn't recognize, but if these films keep having the success I think they will, they definitely could later. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing. I thought it was really good.","

Although i did love the flying scene when the big plane has to out run Rodan.Just watch this movie with the view that you are going to be watching big ass monsters going ape at each other, appreciate the CGi, appreciate the sound and enjoy the feel it gives you, but please make sure you do watch it on Blu-Ray with a good set of headphones or sound system to appreciate the film to its max.Like i said 10/10 for the monsters, 0/10 for the human drama parts, but i didn't want to lower the score because of the human parts.Age: 25 - Cinema: Stevenage iMAX 2D & 3D

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","bononista","31 May 2019","There are So Many people including critics that have ZERO knowledge of Toho Canon, so much so that when I see titles like this I know the person writing has absolutely ZERO emotional or intellectual investment in the 30+ films and Godzilla canon. They espcially have no clue what Mothra is about and missed the 11 appearances over the 65 years, espcially missing the Toho films of the 90's only release in Japan. DO YOUR GODZILLA KAIJU RESEARCH BEFORE GOING TO SEE THE FILM AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE REASON WHY MOTHRA, RODAN, GHIDORAH, AND GODZILLA are of massive significance culturally, spiritually, emotionally, and what they represent socio politcally. From Day One Godzilla has been the creation as a statement against the atom bomb, and moving foward he became a statement against nuclear waste, air polution, polution of the ocean, etc. and how what we as humans do to this planet to destroy it. If such creatures existed today, they SHOULD reclaim the planet because we've doomed it. Mothra IS a spirutal being, Rodan at one point was a serogate to a Mothra egg. Ghidorah was originally a space creature that became a protector when Godzilla was 'off'. To say that this film ""fails"" at it's own canon which IS a blend of antcient beliefs of our being responsible for (mother) earth with the political statement about what we've done to harm it and how it tears us apart as a race is idiotic. It NAILS this, finally, in a US film SOLELY BECAUSE THE FILMMAKERS FINALLY CONSULTED TOHO. These characters were created between 1954 and 1961 with Ghidorah showing up in 1964. If you don't know your Godzilla and Kaiji canon don't go see the film until you do your homework. Walking into Godzilla King of the Monster 2019 with nothing in your pocket other than Godzilla 2014 is the same as try to watch Avengers: Infinity War and Avenger: Engame but having seen NONE of the 10 years worth of MCU films to lock in an emotional and intellectual investment. (It's also why people keep commenting on all the things Captain American would or could have seen or done after he stayed in the 40s - TIME DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, he's on a new world line). Start with watching Rodan's solo film, then Gojira 1954, Godzlla vs Mothra (aka The Thing) 1961, Ghidora's two back to back films, etc. Or, shut up.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","gzilla100","28 May 2020","This movies is freaking amazing i really do love this movie . I was so hyped form this movie yes even more excited than freaking endgame to see my four favorite monsters on the big screen . Also we needed a good Godzilla movie after Godzilla the planet eater which sucks and is my least favorite in the entire series . But this is easily my favorite in the godzilla movie in the monster verse series by far. It feel the most epic and huge . Also this movies is more fast paced than the previous movie and the monsters are it a lot more than the previous movie. The characters are good but a step from the characters from the previous movie . The music is freaking amazing they use old tracks from the older movies for godzilla and mothra which sounded so freaking great. Bear McCreary really did excellent job . Unfortunately we don't hear the themes for rodan and ghidorah but sill the music was still amazing . The design of the monsters where great as well . Godzilla is the same as he was in the previous movie but his spikes have changed to look more like the classic spikes and his feet didn't look like elephant feet this time around . Rodan was freaking amazing this is the best rodan (rodan , ghidorah the three headed monster, invasion of Astro monster , destroy all monsters, godzilla vs mechagodzilla 2, godzilla final wars ,and godzilla king of the monsters)we've seen since 1956 . Also i like how he comes out of a volcano and his fire on him . Also the scence were he's chasing the monarch base was really really well done . Mothra (mothra 1961,mothra vs godzilla , ghidorah the three headed monster , EBIRAH horror of the deep , destroy all monsters ,godzilla vs mothra, godzilla vs spacegodzilla , rebirth of mothra ,rebirth of mothra 2.rebirth of mothra 3, GMK, godzilla Tokyo sos,godzilla final wars, godzilla the planet eater ,and godzilla king of the monsters ) looks good , i do like how she looks more realistic than some of her previous design . Unfortunately mothra and rodan aren't in the movie that much was was a little disappointing because the movie focuses more on godzilla and king ghidorah but still it was nice to see them. Finally king ghidorah (ghidorah the three headed monster , invasion of Astro monster, destroy all monsters, godzilla vs gigan , godzilla vs king ghidorah , GMK,godzilla final wars , godzilla the planet eater ,and godzilla king of the monsters )was amazing . This is easily the best versions of the characters in the entire series . He was huge and massive he really felt like a threat in this movie. Also i loved how the heads had personalities. I do like the Easter eggs they have in this movie which you have to be a die hard godzilla fan to get all the references. The final battle was amazing this is the best looking godzilla fight i mean its not my favorite but still freaking amazing . I highly recommend to watch this movie right freaking now","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Cinemagoer77","25 July 2019","This is what a Godzilla film can be. He is the title character, a kaiju super animal, similar to how humans have superheros. This film is beautifully done with apocalyptic imagery that cannot be forgotten. This is also, King Ghidorah, Rhodan, Mothra done better than anything ever done on screen. If you have ever watched older Godzilla films before this one blows them all away. Also, for those critics saying there is zero human character development, in defense of this one time movie, the mom had the best story. She suffered tragedy, became deluded, realized she was wrong, decided to help and died for redemption. Her story affected the entire family and humanity. Most stories where someone is responsible for mass deaths, and finds redemption the character must die..like Vader died. Pretty decent writing for a movie about a giant lizard. If you want convoluted story lines, more sub-plots because thats what you will get, watch game of thrones. Considering it is a kaiju movie, this film was written fairly well, with a few dead spots. The radiation exposure in the end would have caused their deaths eventually. That is one of my problems with the film but nothing that could not be corrected later on in further films. This was an epic Godzilla film and the box office did no justice. A film for those who watch kaiju films it is a superior film, better than the 2014 film. Do not believe the negative critics. Think about what a kaiju film really is. It is it's own sub-genre. This one rocks all of them.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","StephenIsADumb","2 June 2019","Absolutely one of THE best monster films you will ever see. Super campy acting at times but it is super lovable. Intense action pretty much non-stop. CGI is top notch and very believable considering how absurd the concept of giant monsters is. Go see this even if you are hesitant, you will NOT be disappointed.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","resrwa","31 May 2019","You get what you expect. A beat-em-up spectacular between massive titans.There are some slow bits which I do feel break the tension and were a bit too frequent, and some cringe-worthy one-liners, so I can't give it a higher score than an 8. But it is still well worth the price of admission.The hint at the larger universe of Godzilla/Monarch (Skull Island is mentioned several times) and the setup for the next sequel were exciting (yes, they are going to do THAT versus movie.) The last picture during the end credits definitely confirms that.Also, there IS a short post-credits scene to let you know what Tywin Lannister is up to now...","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","mochteam","25 September 2019","I've had enough with this Godzilla remakes. This movie has barely anything to do with Godzilla and as a matter of fact most of the time they're fighting in the background while the story follows a boring family around and their drama. The worst part is none of them can act and that girl from Stranger things needs to stick to stranger things.I hate when Hollywood white washes Japanese films. The original Japanese shows always revolved around the monsters and this movie just revolves around the boring actors. I don't get why they can't just give you what you came to see a giant monster movie about giant monsters fighting. This thing is 90% family drama and 10% Monsters.They just took the plot from Godzilla vs. Destroyah and incorporated it into this movie in the worst way. Also why is Mothra so weak when Mothra is one of the hardest monsters to beat even for Godzilla and why is Mothra so tiny when it's bigger than Godzilla? Better yet why is Mothra one of the most recognized monsters in the series just a small role that serves no purpose? This moving is stupid, boring, and excruciatingly long. The monster effects and scenes were actually the best part and only good parts yet the monsters are treated like background extra's like this movie isn't titled Godzilla.A better title for this movie would be Boring White Family featuring cameos by Godzilla,Mothra, Rodan and Ghidorah.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","lambiepie-2","2 June 2019","Yes, I am a Godzilla fan from 4 years old. And yes, this is the type of movie an old time fan has been waiting for. Not just Godzilla, but the top Titans. And in that area, this film did not disappoint. It was beyond amazing seeing these Titans with up to date technology. Godzilla was very much bad to the bone. Mothra, was simply beautiful and tough. Monster Zero/King Ghidarah was the best ever on the screen, very hydra, very serpent. That made this a very good film for me.The Titan who surprised me and I wanted to see more - was Rodan. His first appearance in this film was very frightening. It was so good, I wanted to see Rodan with more screen time. And he would have as Mothra should have as well if..and this was the weaker part of the film...if there wasn't too much on the humans.As a fan, I was there for the Titans, and the fighting of the Titans and Godzilla. He was ""God"" +""Zilla"" and much better than what he was in 2014. this film seemed like a good step up and onward as he was more in his element, but the humans inside that element were...distracting. It seemed like when the film was getting good with the Titans battling, they cut to the human 'family drama' and I got to the point where I didn't care. So, I won't mention them in this review beyond generalizations. Don't get me wrong, there should have been humans in the film, but it should have been an either/or proposition. Either take one human and follow it along, or leave the human stories alone and focus on the military which makes perfect sense in a film where big monsters are destroying themselves and cities. That's the draw. That's the interest and as interesting as these Titans were and their stories, there needed to be more on them, very little on the humans.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","FlashCallahan","11 June 2019","Another addition to the so called 'Monsterverse', and another damp squib of a film, with very impressive effects.At least here, Dougherty sort of goes back to basics with the monster mashes, but they are few and far between, and all the filler is lots of incoherent exposition featuring a wealth of gifted actors who will be bad mouthing this film in the next couple of years.Apart from the titular creature, and some 'remember me from the other film' cameos, this film is a totally different 'beast' from Evans 2014 in carnation.Here we have thespian Charles Dance dressed for Jurassic Park, staring menacingly at people whilst holding a gun to someones head. That's him done in the film, and he's the best thing in it, because it's such a bizarre turn for him, even though he pops up in every turgid fantasy film released lately.Obliviously, Nuclear family is a key component of the narrative, with father trying to find estranged wife and daughter, but it's handles so poorly, you just yearn for a CG beast to blow something up.And when it happens, its impressive, but only if you catch it in on the biggest screen and in 3D, you may as well go all out for the spectacle.But although the Kaiju look like they are fighting in the same world as Fincher's Se7en, you cannot help but feel a little excited when Godzilla finally goes thermonuclear.But my word, it's a slog while the monster mash is absent.When the King and the God finally face off next year, this franchise will be extinct.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ConnorMacleodoftheClanMacleod","31 May 2019","Words cannot express the level of enjoyment I gave just experienced watching this film!I have grown up with the Godzilla franchise, I was first introduced to it during the Christmas of 1996. As one of my gifts I was given a VHS copy of the 1965 version Godzilla vs Ghidorah directed by Ishiro Honda. I fell in love with it then and have never turned back. 1998 Godzilla was fun as a kid but looking back was a bit of a let down and then we had the 2014 Hollywood revival of Godzilla vs The Mutos. A controversial view but I think it started the monsterverse off well! As a young kid watching monsters face off against each other is what it truly all about and it still is as a grown up. Who doesn't love a titan battle??For years I have wanted a film of Godzilla facing off against his arch nemesis and now it's here my god does it wow! From the very get go you are thrown into action and unlike the 2014 version they do not beat around the bush, the dialogue between the fantastically picked cast is engaging and informative, they don't shy away from name dropping other Titans either. It is a monster action masterpiece. It's called Godzilla: King of the Monsters, not Godzilla: King of democracy and peace talks. It does exactly what it says on the tin and does not disappoint! If you don't enjoy theses such films then it's not for you, this wasn't made for awards etc, it was made for enjoyment and that's exactly what it provides!The CGI in this film is perfectly balanced, don't read what the pessimists have to say. Why should we not have the best CGI of monsters battling each other? Why should we not see Godzilla running through Boston to tackle Ghidorah? Why should we not these monsters in all their glory. We have screens with such definition these days for reasons and that is for films to shock and awe. It has always been that way and long may it continue. For critics to come out and say that the film uses to much CGI is just rubbish and evidently written by someone who is stuck in their ways... get with the times!A special mention to Ken Watanabe whom reprises his role as Dr Sewizara and is a true hero of this tale, he encompasses everything about an admirer of Godzilla, he brings acting pedigree that does not overshadow all those on screen.If you love the form of escapism that is cinema then go to see this film.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","freewebstennis","2 June 2019","I enjoyed the movie so much. I was extremely happy that there was lot of fight in the movie unlike the first Godzilla movie which was a true disappointment for its screen time fights. I would like to first say ""damn you"" to critics. They honestly have no brains of why they go to watch a movie. A movie like this is for entertainment not for human drama. Most critics talk about poor human character development. I really don't care about them, all I care is about monsters and I had enjoyed it by far the most among all Godzilla movies. Deserves the best rating among all Godzilla movies.Thank you Legendary 10/10.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","ianpuebla-23180","31 May 2019","I've been a Godzilla fan all my life I grew up with these movies what I saw tonight changed my life. It's like America gave Toho 200 million dollars and said ""go make what you know"". The action was mind blowing it felt like a true Godzilla movie. Now for spoilers so unless you haven't watched it yet stop reading and go see it. The Godzilla theme is used in this film that surprised it sounded amazing and was used appropriately. King ghidorah is the main villain obviously. In the old films he is an alien that came to earth to wipe out the planet. In this film he is that an alien that came to earth to wipe out our civilization. There are other monsters in the film but they don't really serve any purpose. There's Kumonga a giant spider, Manda a dragon a wooly mammoth and a MUTO. When king ghidorah is unleashed these monsters bow to him claiming King. Rodan is a wild card at first he's bad serving as King ghidorahs right hand man. Mothra is obviously on Godzilla's side. Godzilla fights king Ghidorah three times in this film!!!! At first Godzilla sents Ghidorah away but the second time Godzilla is defeated but not by Ghidorah by the oxygen Destroyer. Yes this weapon is in the film but only for like 2 minutes it's used to destroy The monsters but fails. Ghidorah survives which brings us to the final battle in Boston. It's godzilla and mothra vs king ghidorah and Rodan. Mothra Stabs Rodan but doesn't kill him. King ghidorah carries Godzilla about 20,000 ft in the air and drops him. Mothra dies protecting Godzilla and her energy is transferred to godzilla making him super powerful. Godzilla absolutely destroys king ghidorah. Ghidorah dies and Godzilla claims the role of king. At the end all the other monsters bow down to godzilla. Now there is a post credit scene. It's not King Kong even though Kong is referenced a lot in the film but doesn't play a role other than a reference. The post credit features the main human villain (Charles dances character) he finds King Ghidorahs corpse and says the line ""I'll take it"" being a Godzilla fan this only means one thing: MECHA KING GHIDORAH!!!!!!!. Overall the film is so much fun and will entertain the crap out of you. For people who aren't into Godzilla you'll enjoy so much that you'll want to know everything there is to godzilla. I'm seeing it at least 3-4 more times.","

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","Sunsphxsuns","3 June 2019","OK - Let's get this part over with right now: In the entire 123-minute film, our scaly, fiery-breath, anti-hero, ""Mr. Godzilla,"" has less than 10 minutes of actual screen time. There, I said it. Now, can we please move on?Much like his other films, Krampus (2015), and Trick 'r Treat (2007), Michael Dougherty, director-writer extraordinaire, offers his vision of a more philosophical, and certainly, respectful, look at this amazing monster film franchise. And for good reason - this is no mere ""monstrous reptile,"" and its theme is most certainly not just about one particular creature.For the newbies to these fascinating films, it is crucial to understand their origin. This mega monster's initial appearance began with filmmaker Ishiro Hondamore, who introduced the first Godzilla movie to Japan in 1954. That modest, regional film, was produced and distributed by Toho, and was the first entry in the Godzilla franchise and Showa series. Godzilla was initially screened in Nagoya on October 27, 1954, and was eventually released throughout Japan. In 1956, a heavily re-edited ""Americanized"" version was re-released in the United States starring America's most famous TV attorney, Perry Mason (credibly played by actor, Raymond Burr). For film history buffs, inserting Burr into selected Japanese scenes was a crude, often clumsy, but effective strategy to conquer the Western film market, and it was a move that worked extremely well. From that point on, that first Godzilla film birthed an unprecedented worldwide multimedia frenzy. The series indeed had ""legs,"" and over the years would spawn a number of successful (though sometimes technically dubious) sequels. Nevertheless, The Guinness World Records recognizes Godzilla as the ""longest running film franchise in history."" As of this writing (2019) Godzilla (the creature and its namesake franchise) continues to enjoy the enviable status as an international pop culture icon. (I blushingly admit I still have - and display - my ""6"" rubber Godzilla toy from the 50's).I'm not going to reveal any of the truly important spoilers here, but I will say this monster-heavy feature is more respectful to its Japanese origins than any of its predecessors (HINT: Look for several obvious references to past characters and situations). Dougherty has created a considerably more apocalyptic tone this time around, but it is also a much more fun and enjoyable romp. The CGI special effects are dazzling and ""over the top."" And the cast - well, let's just say practically everyone (Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Bradley Whitford, Millie Bobby Brown, Tywin Lannister, Thomas Middleditch, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Zhang Ziyi, Aisha Hinds) is so darn likable you want to reach out and hug them were it not for the fact you'd probably get thrown out of the theater!Critics listen up! Do your homework before you brashly decide to trash this wonderful film. My advice: Kick back and simply let this proven Summer blockbuster set the tone for what I hope will herald even greater Godzilla movies to come. And Mr. Michael Dougherty, if you're reading this review, would you PLEASE grant us Trick 'r Treat 2? We're all very anxious for its arrival.",NA

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters","dan-259-431343","1 June 2019","Spoilers - Spoilers - You have been warned and please take my advice and stop reading and just go see the film without knowing everything. Enjoy the unknown. From start to finish this film was a beautifully executed in every way. I loved the story and they delivered as big as Godzilla himself with the other Kaiju and all of the battle scenes and there are a lot. I love the brilliantly set up to what I hope will be a long franchise. Every major Kaiju in this film has a fantastic back story: Rodan coming from a volcano, King Ghidorah from Antartica, and Mothra just blew me away with the beauty and power as the Queen of the monsters. Each major Kaiju was created magnificantly with respect to the originals and updated to very realistic creatures that could exist. There are some spectacular new Kaiju that were all fantastic creations as none of the other Toho Kaijue were used in this film. I loved the entire premise of the ""Titans"" here to restore balance and I love the message of the fact we as humans are destroying this planet and they are here to ""help us"" (well the good titans). I am usually not a fan of children in major films like this and I thought Millie Mae Brown knocked it out of the park. She was independent, strong, and fearless. I just clearly remember while I sat in the theater this afternoon how absolutely pleased, surprised, and moved by this fantastic film. I never thought I would say this as I am now very excited for the next installment of Godzilla vs Kong as I have no doubt it will not be cheesy. Thank you to the entire team behind this film and the fantastic actors across the board who were all amazing. One last spoiler! Love Mothra with a stinger and love King Ghidorah being able to regenerate a lost head. Fantastic. Will see it again next week.",NA
