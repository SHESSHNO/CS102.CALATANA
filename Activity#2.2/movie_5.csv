"John Wick: Chapter 4","neil-476","30 March 2023","The Table, the international crminal brotherhood which has condemned John Wick empowers The Marquis to deal with him (and the Manager of the New York Continentale Hotel). But maybe, just maybe, there is a way out.As expected, the IMDB is full of people saluting this as ""Best John Wick yet,"" ""A masterpiece,"" ""Best action movie ever,"" etc. My view differs. But I must start by giving credit where it is due. Production design, cinematography, action choreography and direction are all first rate, and they deserved a much better film that this is. And this film deserved a much better script than this.The story is fine, quite good even, but it is buried under industrial quantities of action which defies belief. Everbody's resistance to trauma and the complete absence of police are just the big two, but let's not forget the endless succession of pairs of heavies coming out of nowhere and only stopping when Wick has no gun.And even the scriot deserved a better actor than Keanu Reeves. To be fair, the character in the first film has been reduced to a mere cardboard cutout here, but Reeves (who I genuinely like as a performer) doesn't even play cardboard well here.This is beautifully crafted drivel. 7 for craft, 3 for Reeves' central performance, averages to 5.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","siderite","23 May 2023","Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","BA_Harrison","25 March 2023","The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacr√©-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea).","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","namob-43673","23 May 2023","These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","fciocca","24 March 2023","I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","skyhawk747","2 April 2023","What is all the raving about with this movie? I felt it lacked a decent storyline and was 2 hours and 35 mins of fighting while the remaining 10 or so minutes was acting.The usual far too long fighting scenes where he does his usual MMA moves by getting the enemies head between his legs while he reloads his gun and shoots him the head.For me it was at least an hour too long and could have been much shorter. The storyline was very weak and after such a long gap between this and John Wick 3 I am surprised it was written better.I also have no idea why this review has to be a minimum go 600 characters?Yes we.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","antti-eskelinen-329-929792","23 April 2023","In my opinion this is by far the worst movie of the franchise. It's just way too over the top. Everybody seems to have magical jackets now to stop the bullets.Audience loved the dogs on the third one so that just lazily copied one here also but didn't bother to have any real cool scenes with it.I'm happy they made John Wick 1 but since then every movie getting worse and worse. This one was already so bad that I regret spending any money to see it.People shooting and dying in center of Paris but police doesn't seem to care.John Wick getting shot, falling from great heights etc without any issues.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","24 March 2023","In this fourth installment of 8711's successful franchise, Keanu Reeves wearily drags himself from setpiece to setpiece, saying little, surviving the most ridiculous setups and finally achieves nothing.The acting and writing of JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 are indeed the worst aspects of this film, and the exaggerated runtime of almost three hours doesn't help.Try to remember John Wick's motivation to do all the things he does. What exactly is he actually doing, escpecially in this one? In addition to a lack of motivation, Chapter 4 is a remarkable retcon in the sense that John Wick could have ended the hunt for his person way earlier, thus making at least the last two installments redundant.There's plenty of action here, sure, but it has been getting more and more unrealistic, and so you'll be in a situation where your suspension of disbelief says bye-bye, especially when you contrast the growing ridiculousness of the action with John Wick's decreasing vigour.The plot has some toddler level plot holes and contrivances which are really distracting, yes, even in an action no-brainer like this. Keanu Reeves has maybe ten lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The Marquis is a nonsense character, just like Donnie Yen's Caine character. They just appear, but especially in Caine's case you're supposed to be emotional about it because he's basically John Wick's brother from another mother. We just never knew about him. Oh well.This is the definition of a dumb movie for dumb people, and if you just want to enjoy some nice shots and over-the-top action (some of which is really nice) AND love Keanu Reeves, this is your jam. If you need a bare minimum of consistency and structure, you might feel cheated.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","dstan-71445","28 May 2023","Very much over rated. Repetitive, tiring and inauthentic fight choreography for 3 hrs straight. Unnatural and generic one liner filled script. No deep drama whatsoever. Just bland, perpetual killings till one is numb. Awful and fake seeming blood effects. Bland, cliched action hero.All these characterize John Wick 4. These movies keep getting shallower with every sequel. The little soul the first two had is dead and buried here. I don't get the hype. John Wick has become like those generic, action B movies with cliched scripts and characters. Not to forget the unlikable and uncharismatic addition, black guy with a dog. He was as dull as it gets.Beautiful cinematography though. Loved some of the scenes except the CGI ones. A point for that I guess.","

This hybrid comic book-video game has a stupid plot, worse than average acting, and fight scenes that are so poorly done you don't mind going to the bathroom. Don't get me wrong. I loved John Wick 1. Thought #2 was OK. Then came #3., It showed they were out of imagination and should have stopped with #2. Now with #4 they show that they are not artists or creatives but merely clowns looking for as buck.It's not completely without value, which is why it got a 2 instead of a 1. The photography is beautiful and they have a dog as a hero. The rest is worthless. Save the money and the time.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","MovieIQTest","29 March 2023","From the very beginning to the end, nothing but endless kills, fighting, close combats, bloods squirts or splashes, KR after four chapters, he looked older, slower and tiresome. The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring, katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games.When John Wick fought for his life in the Japanese hotel against so many clueless foes and the Zatoishi-like blind swordsman played by Donny Yen with a Botox injected face, we all decided to quit at the same time.Hey, it's time to wrap it up, guys, no sense to continue to Chapter 5!","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","lovemichaeljordan","22 March 2023","Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","FeastMode","24 March 2023","Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this. Updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.(5 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 3/23/2023, UltraScreen 3/28/2023, SuperScreen 4/10/2023, re-issue IMAX 5/2/2023, 9/22/2023)","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","markvanwasbeek","23 March 2023","By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","kskmah","26 April 2023","Who needs a 2hr and 40 min action movie? No one. Yes the action was good, but repeats so many times that it becomes so boring. How can hundreds of assassins not kill one man? Answer, not possible, only in this movie and series. How many times could the dog man have killed Wick? Many. So no other assassin could? Why would the table head get Caine to kill Wick when he knows he won't. You can challenge the head to a duel as a rule, but they only assigned a head for the first time ever in this movie? WTF? And then the head can select a replacement? And he selects a blind man. All Wick had to do was to stand on the side or drop down and he wouldn't get shot. I think everyone knew Wick didn't shoot in the last round, except for the stupid head bad guy. This is not an action movie, it's a fantasy.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","tresm87","16 March 2023","Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.","

If you thought the first one was enjoyable but the 3rd one was bull, read on.Just as the body count in the 3rd was ridiculous, this is even more absurd. Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits, raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny. He's the best hitman on the world, how do we kill him? I know, we'll send a blind man!! Pathetic. And he can dodge bullets and he knows where everyone is. You could say it looked choreographed.Now, about the DJ! They may have well cut the scenes directly from the Warriors. Better film, done better and that isn't a great film. For those of you who have never heard of the Warriors, go watch it.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","cadillac20","17 March 2023","Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","vengeance20","25 March 2023","Ok, so I got back from seeing this entry yesterday night. I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think ""dafuq!?""The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes
John Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes
John Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes
John Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutesNotice how the films got long & long with each entry...!Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing & overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare & when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long & annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad & anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I've lost hope in this franchise! Let's hope John Wick 5 (if ever) redeems this kak entry!4/10 & that's generous considering!","

As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.The film opens in New York City, the home of the notorious Continental Hotel, and takes us to Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany. Each of those cities plays a major role in Reeves' quest to seek revenge against the High Table for the acts outlined in the prior films, and to seek his unconditional freedom from service to their order.As the story unfolds we learn a bit more about Wick's past and upbringing than we did in the prior films, but not enough to get bogged down in. He uses his connections to his past, and the help of some old friends to find a path to level the playing field with the High Table's Emissary, The Marquis, played masterfully by Bill Skarsg√•rd. Skarsg√•rd makes the character memorable, and unique, with just a hint of Santino from the second installment.Keanu Reeves as John Wick in John Wick 4. Photo Credit: Murray Close
Hiroyuki Sanada and Reeves are reunited, having starred in 47 Ronin together. Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga? Remember, I said this was a Spoiler free review....John Wick: Chapter 4 earns a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is worth seeing, and probably seeing again. I predict a significant box office gross for this one, and it is well deserved.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Phil_H","3 June 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 is almost three hours of Keanu Reeves engaged in a gunfight, bookended with meaningless dialog-in-place-of-plot, and a lot of people being thrown down stairs. Of all the ""Wick"" movies, this is clearly the weakest one yet. Was anything added to the overall Wick-universe narrative? No. Did we see a whole lot of inconsequential people die? Yes. Did Keanu Reeves say ""yeah"" a lot? Yes.Look, I was hoping for SO much more than this. A meaningful ending to the series (which it isn't, because apparently this made so much money they are working on a fifth film), but what we got here was something in very much need of more script doctoring and less ""bang-bang.""With a little more work, this could have been an average movie. Don't talk to me about stunts or cinematography or the choreography of the actors in-play, wow me with a plot that makes sense and moves the story forward--John Wick 4 does not move the story forward. It just says ""let's shoot a bunch of people, okay?"" And that's what it does... for 3 hours.In the end I was of the following opinion once the credits rolled: ...and?...We all deserved better than this. John Wick did, too.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","solidabs","25 March 2023","HORRIBLE movie. I love John Wick. I mean I wouldn't pay to see one, but I love the series none the less. Even liked the third one even though the ending blew baby chunks. All the 10s and 9s scores are so damn fake it's hilarious. IMDB is a joke. Someone needs to start a real movie database and weed out the fake high scores, it's as ridiculous as John Wick 4. He walks away from every major injury or collision or building fall. Then he passes away from flesh wounds. What nonsense. The whole plot is nonsense. The fights scene are so boring. I got up to make a sandwich twice. Just the typical 100 judo throws and same shots to head. Numerous coup de grace's. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this nonsense.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","jtindahouse","23 March 2023","In a world where movie sequels seem to be loathed even before they are released, the 'John Wick' series has remained remarkably consistent and well received. In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsg√•rd. He was everything a villain should be. Calm and seemingly in control, menacing and easy for the audience to hate and root against.This film was a blast from start to finish. 9/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","leftbanker-1","27 May 2023","He fights and bites, he fights and bites and fights. Fight, fight fight, bite, bite, bite, it's John Wick, the silliest action movie franchise in history...and it runs 2h49m so there's a lot of extra fighting and biting.Serial killer John Wick is at it again, folks. They should have a graphic in the top right corner of the screen counting how many people he kills in every movie. If watching this doesn't make your brain hurt, you may need to get yours fixed.Everyone talks about the well-choreographed fight scenes, but they have zero link with reality that there can be no tension felt by viewers. Of course, John Wick will walk away from his battles, no matter how stupidly absurd the odds.There can be zero tension in an action movie when there is this much carnage going on. If the hero always comes through, no matter how daunting the odds are against him, why bother watching? Just fast-forward to the end, or stand up and walk out of the theater.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","007Waffles","23 June 2023","The first John Wick was the best, after that they all went down hill. There's no point to these movies.John Wick 4 is three hours of mind-numbing repetition. Keanu reading the script: ""Punch, roll, headshot, repeat. Dude, I think I got it.""
I'm not even sure what John Wick was trying to accomplish. These movies could have gone on for 100 years and nothing would have changed.And evidently everyone is now bullet proof and has infinite ammo. John took out 250 guys with his 9mm pistol. He's also invincible. He can fall several stories and not even break a bone, get run over a dozen times, and roll down a million stairs.I would have enjoyed this movie more if at the end he took off flying because he was really Neo in a simulator and all of this took place in the Matrix, which would explain Laurence Fishburn.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","imseeg","24 March 2023","The bad: it lasts too long. A whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes. Some of the fighting scenes stretch out over 5 to 15 minutes of CONTINEOUS fighting. But after having watched over 2 hours of fighting already, I definitely began to long for it to end.The good: the fighting scenes are pretty good though. I was wondering if they could still come up with some new and interesting fighting choreography and they succeeded at that quite well. There are even quite a few comical fighting stunts included. Nice!All in all not a bad sequel. If it werent for the much TOO long duration I would rate this nr 4 sequel better / higher as the nr 3 edition.Nothing beats the original first edition of John Wick though, because THAT first edition was not only contineous action but also cared about the CHARACTERS. Unfortunately all the sequels were more and more focussed on solely the figthing scenes, which kinda bored me in the end.Nr 4 is highly overrated. I suspect because of artificial ""managing"" of the Imdb ratings. This movie is never worthy of 8 stars (ridiculous). 6 stars at best. But because I got bored at the end I will only rate it 5 stars...","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","furnacefuneral","23 March 2023","Indiana jones, terminator, predator, Jurassic park, the matrix, Jason bourne, etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point. This is why john wick is the best action action movie franchise of all time; The movies just keep getting better and better. In john wick 4, when the action starts in Osaka Japan, it never let's up despite it's almost 3 hour running time. What I really enjoyed the most about JW4 is the cast of characters. Great villains and allies really keep this movie interesting as john trots the globe for 3 hours. The sound engineering, editing, direction, cinematography are excellent as always. The color schemes throughout this franchise (more john wick 2, 3 and especially 4) are such a treat for the eyeballs. Best action franchise EVER. And the shotgun fight in Paris with the ""dragons breath"" is the best action sequence I've probably ever seen in my life.","

This 4th wick movie was water down and embaressingly woke with a corney addition to the wick roster of assasins. Kane somewhat saved the movie at times but the movie felt vague and amibiguous with endless fighting and wayy over the top action the
that took wick to a level of absurdity and crossed over to ridiculous and clever or as cool as part 3. Thr crafty skills wernt on display in the same they were in the last 3 movie outside of one glorious overhead camera shot of wick blistering through a apartment building. This scene alone bumped this film up into the above average relm.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","statuskuo","27 March 2023","Sitting through the nearly 3 hours of this opus, I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth. But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like ""City Of Lost Children"" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from ""No Time To Die"" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists. All Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","minunimion","27 May 2023","I don't get why this movie has a high score, it doesn't deserve it. It's horrible, it doesn't make any sense, just killing people, but how can it be possible that those people after being shot many times, were able to fight as nothing happened to them? And the plot? Trying to kill John Wick in any way possible, period.The worst thing is that they used some scenes from the movie The Warriors (1979), they didn't try to change anything, a black woman with nice big lips, talking on the radio, guiding the gangs with the purpose to chase and kill The Warriors. Same with John Wick, but of course with a modern technology. Shame on you! Didn't you have any better idea? You just copied an old movie that was much better than this one, and that soundtrack was great!What a disappointment! It remembers somehow Kill Bill, but that movie was very good, this one is almost unacceptable!I enjoyed the other movies about John Wick, they were very well done, and had a good plot. This time it seems like they didn't know what to write.Not even the ending was good, is he really dead? We can't be sure, and probably there will be a John Wick 5, because something is missing. Anyway the fight against the thugs, before the last duel, was really bad... just a videogame.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","UniqueParticle","24 March 2023","May or may not count as a spoiler but John Wick pilled up more of a body count than Jason Vorhees sure different genre yet both great killing machines! Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers, the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise! I'd like to say too I own all the John Wick films and every Matrix, I'll get this in 4K when available.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","radhrh","28 March 2023","Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Then there's the blatant plagerism of Walter Hill's, The Warriors which demonstrates just how little new the franchise has to offer. Time to call it a day.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","codytheway","27 March 2023","Listen, this movie was far from as good as the others and had very little realism to it compared to the others. Numerous times John falls from like 4 stories up and gets up and walks it off. He also gets hit by cars numerous times and simply just walks it off. He also falls down 222 steps and gets up and walks it off. Where is the realism here?Also, the acting was incredibly bad. Like really really bad. Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins? And lastly, why did John go through allllll of that crap just to die at the end? To protect Winston? The dude who shot him off roof?Overall, there was only a couple of good parts to the movie. Nothing that the other 3 movies hadn't done before.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","mklarsen-51895","22 March 2023","We all walk into John Wick 4 with expectations of what we will see, standards we refuse to lower and excitement already creeping in. From the first second it engages you, no hesitation, no quarter. And it's only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn't a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren't wrong. Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is ""lesser"" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :DI know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not, I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.Don't leave until after the credits are done. Trust me, it's not finished.","

Previous movies had different types of action and stunt choreographies. This one has long same fights , might be in different locations.As far Keanu goes, his close up shots or his face doesnt appear in the movie atleast for a half time. John wick past movies had few dialogues but it had an impact, 4 has same few dialogues but it was very plain and flat.Ending is Spoiler - John Wick Dies (or not) shown in a way that if there is a possibility of a sequel , there can be.May stunts shots and its accuracy is totally gone, we can clearly see that where the gun is aimed and it just went like a paper plane. Even with the so-called Coat Armour, some pistol shots were directly aimed at Head / Leg which was again repelled with the armor which is in the shoulder.The sad thing is this is the same with Balayya movies, but when it directed and taken in Hollywood people go crazy!An average movie 6/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Tactrix","22 May 2023","So I like the John Wick series as much as the next guy but this is just lazy. There are a couple of things that we need to address here.First the story has gotten very VERY stale. Like to the point of where if you removed the story, it wouldn't have mattered, at all.Second as where in the first movie there was some pretty damn good choreography, in this installment I literally watched MULTIPLE scenes of guys standing around waiting for 1 guy to go down so they could pretend to jump in. And no, this wasn't like a behind the scenes take.And the final insult is the actual fighting itself, there are just times when for no reason the person he's fighting just sits there, they aren't knocked out, they aren't dead, they're just waiting for him to get his gun, load some bullets, go for a coffee, and then shoot them. It actually pains me to watch this garbage be pawned off as a top tier movie.This is when you guys should stop this series, lets be honest you should have stopped it at the last movie, but ok, you had to give it a proper ending.

Still, I can't resist adding a few gripes of my own. Forgive me for repeating what other's have already written, but I feel like it's the only way I can get rid of this very bad taste in my mouth.Keanu I love you with a passion, but you're too old and creaky to come off as someone who is impervious to cars slamming into you at 45mph. The scene where you fall 75+ feet onto a car and walk away like nothing happened? Hahahahaha. Stop it, you're killing me.And you, with your gray beard, rolling down 222 stone steps ----- ALL the way down the steps, and then AGAIN part way, even though there are multiple breaks in the stairs where (kudos to stunt work!) anyone else would have eventually come to a halt in their rolling? ---- pure comedy.The fight scenes where the guys WAIT for you to make your move, over and over and OVER again. Beyond painful to watch. The audience can practically see the cartoon balloon over your head reading, ""Okay. Now this is where I insert my left leg in between this dude's legs and I heave myself over, so we twist and, as he falls, he very helpfully throws himself to the side and then he waits for me to shoot him in the head.""The fight scene choreographers should all die of shame. Is this the best they could do? Time after time the bad guy pulls back and you can almost hear him saying to himself, ""Wait for it. This is where Keanu comes at me, jumps on my chest and then shoots and stabs me. Ready set go!""Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Lance Riddick, Ian McShane, Larry Fishburne = Great performances. Keanu? Some of the worst of the worst of your acting effort, sad to say. Really BAD.One last thing: Ian McShane's upper teeth really bothered me. As in mesmerized by their fakeness and fit type bother me. Can't unsee that.Of course Baba Yaga isn't dead. Pfft. But I sure hope this franchise is. Enough is enough.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","17 March 2023","That lasted 169 minutes? I had no idea. The time just flew right by.Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","musicnetwork-85033","16 May 2023","John Wick 1 was the best imo. The story was somewhat coherent and drew attention. There was plenty of action that was exciting without being over-the-top ridiculous.Next up in John Wick 2, the story was still somewhat coherent and though some scenes started to become a bit nonsensical(tons of assassins and no police etc), it was still a solid movie and easy to follow.In John Wick 3 everything took a nosedive into utter nonsense. Part 4 expanded on this with nothing but lots of ridiculous wild nonstop fights. Typical Hollywood cash grabs devolved into absolute boring and ridiculous rubbish.","

Stunt choreography , Camera work , editing and heart pumping BGMs were totally bonkers . There were many prolonged action sequences through out the movie , each of them never fails to deliver some thrill and adrenaline rush . Besides from action set pieces , JW4 well contributed in the world building and this whole tetralogy done a good job in World building & character establishments , I hope it will be well used in its upcoming spin off series and movies . Cast did great job , especially Keanu Reeves and Donie Yen were great .Cons - Few silly logical mistakes that you can't ignore .Overall , to the action lovers and John wick fans out there don't miss out to watch it on big screen .

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Zeus-pro","17 March 2023","John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Andrew_Wiper","24 March 2023","Quite possibly the best action movie of the decade. It's only 2023. This one is currently number one. Terminator 2 is the best action movie of all time. The raid 2 is the best action sequel of all time. This movie is the best 4th movie in a series of all time. Props to lethal weapon 4 as well. Keanu is a bad ass ok. He moves a little slow in the beginning but by the time the second half comes along he moves like a martial arts madman. That being said.. the nunchucks he incorporates into his character in that first half is brilliant. The set pieces in this are absolutely fantastic. The music is perfectly incorporated as well. There were a few nods to some classic flicks too. Movie buffs will catch them.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Holt344","26 March 2023","My expectations for John Wick: Chapter 4 was high, these films have become some of my favorite action films of all time, and I can say this without giving it a second thought how it met those expectations. The thugs and easy obstacles are nothing new, except for how they too have ballistic suits like our protagonist. But this Chapter begins with a recovered Baba Yaga who's out for blood. Actors and returning characters along with Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Ian McShane as Winston Scott, and Lance Reddick (in one of his final roles) as Charon. New roles which I loved was Donnie Yen as Caine: a blind High Table assassin and an old friend of John Wick.Bill Skarsg√•rd as the Marquis Vincent de Gramont: a powerful member of the High Table whose position is challenged by John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most, I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that. Brilliant choreography for each character, good guys like bad guys. With Hiroyuki Sanada being as brilliant as ever! Also showing off Donnie Yen's retired blind assassin. It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special, you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris, it has the biggest importance to the story, it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsg√•rd holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though, maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else, and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie, both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter, it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take, except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above, letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades, his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film, small like big, all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, I don't have any problem with it, it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood, it's about what happens on the screen, blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length, Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long, full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story, only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim, yes, but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was, but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends, to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point, Chad uses the film's length for just that, to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!This might be the best film of the four, both action and drama, also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft, making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it, when I saw it at the cinema, a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside, John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix, John ""Baba Yaga"" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for. This was an incredible film, one of the best I've seen in awhile.","

What was the purpose of the producers, script writers and the director to spend so much time and money for this thrash? Was there anything plausible in this so called movie? John Wick I was ok within its fiction universe of assassins and mobs etc. And somehow watchable action scenes.

But this fourth movie, is a complete pile of rubbish. There's no real people in this movie, only assassin's and people dancing. D. Yen plays a blind martial artist, just for a change! There's no real story line, just fight scenes after fight scenes. The suits are like the protective shields from Dune. Each fight scene is boring as there's no real investment in the characters. John Wick says literally about 8 words in the whole movie. One word at a time, normally just a single name. I can't believe this gets such a high rating. Honestly it was painful to watch.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","movie-reviews-uk","26 March 2023","Let's be honest if, by now, you choose to see a ""John Wick"" movie then you know what's coming. Several hours of hyperkinetic, over the top violence with a pounding soundtrack and moody lighting. On this front ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" delivers and then some.There isn't a plot that I can recall but once again our favourite assassin is wrestling with the unseen High Table and the price on his head is increasing faster than post-Covid inflation. So every goon in a suit is out to collect and John has to wade through a tsunami of bodies in order to, well, keep killing people.Clearly there's no logic here as John has no identifiable motive anymore or even an end-goal in mind. Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets shot in the head at close range.So is it a great film? Well yes because ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" plays it straight down the line and sticks religiously to its aesthetic. There are no in-jokes here, in fact there are more grunts than dialog, and the film absolutely believes in itself. On that front it's a right belter.","

I thought the action sequences were stupid like one that reminded me of the scene in Hot Rod where Andy Samberg goes flying down and a hill and doesn't stop for miles. Apparently this is one of John Wick's new superpowers, to be able to survive long falls. The Scout character is extra stupid and unnecessary. I don't understand his motivation. There's too many characters here that are supposed to be important. I just found everything confusing and redundant. There may have been one or two scenes that I liked but I can't even think which they are. Keannu is too slow now to pull these fight scenes off. Donnie reprises his role from Star Wars Rogue One.

Donnie Yen plays a blind martial arts expert, a role he knows all too well since he played an identical character in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. And that really sets up the debate around whether plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, or just a dumb, lazy rip off. There are references aplenty from the sci-fi/kung fu genres, including some of Keanu's own efforts. He knows kung fu-and shows us. It's kung fu'd up the wazoo. I imagine the director, a stunt man himself, simply Scotch taped together one fight scene after the next. FOR THREE HOURS! Three writers are credited with crafting 380 words of dialogue for Mr. Reeves. Okay, I read that Stahelski and Reeves stripped out roughly half the dialogue written for his character in the initial script. Accordingly, I would have stripped the writers of their entire salary. The first instalment featuring this legendary hit-man was just that, a smash hit. However, much like the Matrix sequels John Wick: Chapter 4 just gets on my wick.Incidentally, the movie tagline is Baba Yaga. More appropriate would be jibber-jabber.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","quickdraw88","26 May 2023","A dramatic step down in quality from previous entries in the series.The main drawcard being the action sequences and gunplay. Sadly in chapter 4 they lack any stakes and become boring and repetitive almost instantly. Bullets have no effect or simply pass through people, stuntmen routinely stumble while waiting for their queue to attck then die, basics like taking cover take a back seat to flashy unnecessary spin that some one thought ""looked cool"". Many sequences just look like a bad dress rehearsal they decided to keep.Unnecessary characters that add nothing to the already non existent plot. Streets or famous landmarks are completely empty or filled with bystanders that appear to be in a different dimension, oblivious to the insane acts of violence occurring next to them until it suits the plot or they vanish into thin air from one shot to the next. Not a single police car or officer called out the entire movie. In possibly the most unrealistic scene, an entire subway train in Osaka is empty. This is a movie that holds the same level of quality and planning you'd expect from a bunch of 7 year old boys playing bang bang in their back yard. ""My suit is bullet proof"" you hear them yell as you chuckle and sigh, ""ah kids.."" You really really need to switch off your brain to enjoy this 3hr slog, or just laugh at how poorly planned and executed the entire idea is.I can understand people wanted this to be good and rated it highly because these types of movies are indeed in short supply these days and I also want to see more quality adult action movies made.

Title: ""John Wick 4: Explosive Action with a Repetitive Plot""Word Count: 709""John Wick 4"" is the highly anticipated sequel to the action-packed franchise that has captivated audiences with its adrenaline-fueled sequences. While the film delivers on its promise of spectacular action scenes, it falls short in terms of originality and narrative depth. Despite its flaws, ""John Wick 4"" manages to entertain fans of the series, but fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors.Undeniably, the movie showcases some truly impressive action sequences. From intense gunfights to jaw-dropping stunts, the film's choreography and execution are impeccable. The fight scenes are meticulously crafted, and Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication to his role as the lethal assassin John Wick. The combination of Reeves' physicality and the expertly designed action sequences creates a thrilling cinematic experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.However, the film's biggest flaw lies in its repetitiveness. While the previous installments of the franchise offered a fresh take on the action genre, ""John Wick 4"" feels like a rehash of familiar territory. The plot fails to bring anything new to the table, resulting in a sense of predictability that diminishes the overall impact of the film. The narrative lacks the complexity and depth that fans have come to expect from the series, leaving much to be desired.One of the disappointments of ""John Wick 4"" is the lack of a compelling story. The film relies heavily on the established formula of John Wick facing insurmountable odds and battling countless adversaries. The absence of a coherent and engaging plot prevents the movie from reaching its full potential. While the franchise has never been known for its intricate storytelling, this installment takes it to a new level by prioritizing action over substance.Another aspect that hampers the film's impact is the portrayal of the High Table. In previous movies, the enigmatic organization added an element of intrigue and mystery to the narrative. However, in ""John Wick 4,"" the High Table becomes a monotonous antagonist whose only purpose seems to be providing John Wick with repeated chances for redemption. This narrative choice not only diminishes the stakes but also makes the world feel less grounded and realistic.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","hjvergara","24 March 2023","""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is one of the most captivating, exciting, eye-popping, hyperkinetic, and beautiful action films ever made. Director Chad Stahelski has done the unthinkable; he has outdone himself in this fourth entry by taking a two hour and forty-nine-minute runtime (the longest in the series) and making it feel an hour shorter. This is a combat magnum opus, a relentless sensory experience, gorgeously hyperviolent, and easily the best in the series.Baba Yaga is, once again, fighting to defeat the High Table while also facing a devilish and powerful new adversary (a disquieting and deviously memorable performance by Bill Skarsg√§rd as Marquis) in death-defying, blood-spurting, neon-blasting, stunts-to-spare, well-groomed, high-fashion style. Yes, the plot is rather simple, straightforward, and lacking in in-depth character background, but that hasn't been the strength of any of the Wick films anyway.The masterful elements at play in ""Chapter 4"" begin with its colorful, even extravagant, and likeable supporting characters including Laurence Fishburne as the crafty Bowery, Clancy Brown as the cryptic Harbinger, Donnie Yen - electrifying as the blind, yet intuitive Caine - and most terrifically, Shamier Anderson as Tracker - a shady spy-like character that gives an indelible performance that ranges from brutal toughness to vulnerable subjugation.Add heart-pounding sound effects and a pulsating musical score, striking nighttime, dark and gritty noir-inspired cinematography, and masterful fighting choreography that frames Wick in different cities with sumptuous vistas across the globe (the locales are outstanding from Sacr√© Coeur, to Arc de Triomphe, to the Louvre, to the Eiffel Tower in France to the opening scene in Aqaba, Jordan plus Berlin and Tokyo) and you end up with what feels like the most edgy, revolutionary, and most James Bond-esque entry yet.The elaborate and visceral set designs are ""Chapter 4's"" crowning achievement; lavish and rich with detail, they put Wick in elegant and high-tech rooms, ornate buildings, rousing nightclubs, and most memorably, a long flight of stairs and heavily trafficked streets where gut-wrenching, head-popping fighting sequences ensue. It's a WICKedly wild ride from beginning to end that left me breathless, gasping, and exclaiming ""wow!"" in wonderment.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","TristanSilya","17 April 2023","I can see why people love it and I can see why people hate it. People want different things out of a movie and John Wick 4 delivers exceptionally well in certain areas while being mediocre in others.A quick summary is I had a fking great time watching it at some points and a little bored during others. The action scenes are fantastic. It's a TON of fun and really cool to watch. A little towards the middle of the film it did feel a bit slow and dragged out. Cutting out 15 mins would be perfect.Held up by good action and decent laughs is the weak story. I absolutely LOVE the idea of the underground black market, the continentals, and the high table. I wish we got to see more of that world. I wanted more backstory, more exposure, more display of how they ran behind the scenes. Hopefully I'll get to see that in the Ballerina and Continental.The other thing I think hindered the movie was that the idea of the high table got watered down. They started off as some serious group that mean business that you don't want to mess with. In John Wick 4 I felt like they were kind of a joke and not really as big as mean as people made them out to be. John Wick was just so broken in the 4th chapter. I know it's the whole appeal of John Wick but it does take away from the story and suspense when, even with suspension of disbelief, is just pure absolute absurdity. But that's also why I love it!I swear John Wick can take more hits than some Avengers. He's like a tank with the body of Wolverine.But regardless of what you're looking for you have to give it to the crew for how much work and dedication they put in to this movie. The quality really shows here. It's just really fun and exciting to watch. I rate it higher than the other John Wick films even though it's not my favorite just because in 9 out of 10 ways it's bigger and better.But I love the other John Wick films because we got more backstory, more Continental, and more focus on story.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","nederlandhiker-22571","25 May 2023","By far the worst of the four unless you are a brainless action junkie looking for a fix.It didn't take much writing for this one, everyone wants to kill John and John kills everyone, the end.The first three chapters at least had a break where a storyline appeared and there was some dialogue between the actors that added to the story in between fight scenes. The fourth one seemed to be no more than a poorly written attempt at cashing in on the first three. Profit seemed to be the motivating factor.?On the upside, the action scenes were good, though like drinking, it may have been better served if done in moderation, with a little time left over for a story.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","FilmFanatic2023","19 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 is the latest installment in the popular action franchise starring Keanu Reeves as the titular assassin. Directed by Chad Stahelski, who helmed all the previous films, this sequel continues the story of John Wick's quest for freedom from The High Table, a mysterious organization that rules over the underworld. Along the way, he faces new enemies and allies, as well as old friends and foes.The movie is a feast for action fans, as it showcases some of the most impressive and inventive fight scenes ever put on screen. From gunfights to knife fights, from car chases to horse chases, from Paris to Tokyo, John Wick: Chapter 4 never lets up on the adrenaline and excitement. Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication and skill as an action star, performing most of his own stunts and delivering his trademark deadpan humor.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg√•rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.The movie is not without its flaws, however. At nearly three hours long, it feels bloated and overstuffed at times. Some scenes drag on for too long or feel unnecessary. Some plot points are confusing or underdeveloped. Some characters are underused or wasted. The movie also relies heavily on fan service and references to previous films, which may alienate newcomers or casual viewers.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","FlashCallahan","25 March 2023","John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table, and earning his battered body, a much deserved freedom.But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe, and forces that turn old friends into foes......First of all, any film that features Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins is a must for any action film aficionado. But to have them in a John Wick film isn't just a dream come true, it's a work of sheer genius. I've had my expectations high for several films this year, such as Pants Man, Cocaine Bore, and Scream VI, which have all let me down.So I tried to lower my expectations for this, but I couldn't. Because this franchise has just been getter bigger and better with each instalment. And does it meet expectations?Too bloody right it does, it's a masterpiece in set pieces and going above and beyond in pleasing the fans.There are five huge set pieces that are wonderfully staged, and they are brutal and unflinching, and usurp anything from the previous three movies.The first is at Shimazus Continental, and although it goes on for a while, it's breathtaking, reminiscent of the shootout at the end of Parrabellum, but with Yen making good use of an everyday household item, and the icing on the cake for this sequence, Wick using nunchucks. That's all you need to know. Wick using nunchucks.The second features again, Yen, but now we have Scott Adkins thrown in. And for good measure, he's wearing a fat suit. Again, beautifully staged, with Wick suffering badly this time at the hands of Adkins, with a beautiful diegetic piece from Le Castlevania, keeping the tradition of the franchise. If you though a pencil was a good weapon, wait until you see what is used here.Thirdly, and arguably the best, we have a shoot out around the Arc De Triumphe. A ballet of cars and bullets that had me on the edge of my seat. It's so seamless and expertly made, I doubt you'll find a better cinematic action scene this decade. It's that beautiful.Fourthly, we have a wonderful over head long take with Wick taking out bad guys from room to room, using the most unique gun of the series. It's literally a blast.And the most bone crunching and funniest sequence is on the steps leading to the church. It puts The Exorcist to shame.All this clocking in at nearly three hours, and I didn't once find the film bloated or lagging. As for Reeves, he's a movie star. Some of his acting is pretty questionable in the film, but the man has screen presence, and by his performance, he's dedicated to the cause of Wick.What let the side down a little was Skarssgards pantomime portrayal of the villain. He's far too camp to be in the least but threatening, and the 'help' Wick received from the tracker was a little too convenient at times.But minor quibble aside, this is a masterpiece of action, it's balls to the wall from the moment you see the Thunder Road PC logo, right until the fade of the last scene.This is everything you've expected and more. If you are a fan of the action genre, see this, you've deserved it.Look out for a Wilhelm scream, and a stinger.'Chefs Kiss'","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","masonsaul","25 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action masterpiece, an emotionally investing, unashamedly pretentious and extremely satisfying final chapter that continues to celebrate stunt work as the art form it absolutely is and deliver franchise high spectacle that really does put the majority of other action films to shame.Keanu Reeves is even more agile than ever and continues to really impress in the action despite being 4 films in. Once again though, it's not just the action he excels at with the sense of finality this time around adding a sombre and contemplative nature to his performance that is beautiful.The supporting cast is insanely stacked, a definite new record for this franchise. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne play to their familiar strengths and really dial them up. Then there's the newcomers, starting with Shamier Anderson who has a really interesting angle to his character that's a lot of fun.Rina Sawayama makes a terrific screen debut and has great chemistry with Hiroyuki Sanada who can do no wrong and his reunion with Reeves is a joy to see. Bill Skarsg√•rd is another memorable villain for this franchise as a character who dresses like a gentleman but acts like the complete opposite.Scott Adkins plays against type in hilarious fashion and then there's Donnie Yen. Obviously he's perfect in the action scenes and just so cool but on top that he's one of the best characters because his conflict with John isn't as black and white as previous antagonists, making it all the more interesting.Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, the action scenes are still super clean and impeccably choreographed. There's a nightclub scene that actually improves over the original, a fight in oncoming traffic that's jaw droppingly good and a one take that is one of the best of all time.The film also offers an excellent reminder that Stahelski is an amazing visual stylist as well. With Dan Laustsen's cinematography he creates a beautifully film that makes each location visually unique and the lighting in particular is just stunning throughout.The pacing is so good, gaining momentum early on and never letting up. The music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard is once again incredible, bringing back all the greatest hits without solely relying on them and actually creating the most unique score of the four with plenty of new pieces.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Scar38","26 October 2023","Am I the only one who finds this film terrible? I was looking forward to it because I like Keanu Reeves and Scott Adkins, but the fight scenes are atrocious, they are so slow and out of sync, multiple times I noticed actors waiting to be hit, and in the background you can clearly see the actors missing each other, in one scene the Chinese woman was fighting with two bad guys and as one of the went to hit her, he clearly stops to give her time, which is so amateur, it's embarrassing. I remember the other three films, and I must say the first one was the best. It is nice to see some other great actors though, Clancy Brown, Lawrence Fishburne, Ian McShane, Donnie Yen to name a few.Sorry but I found it terrible.","

No one goes to see a 'John Wick' movie for anything remotely close to realistic fights or gun battles- it's about the body count, hand to hand combat and just how far the director will take things as John absorbs so much abuse yet hardly comes away with a scratch!I usually avoid movies like this however will admit it took my mind off the daily crap of life. This one is much better than the last one- Halle Berry's character was more annoying to me than a female killing machine complement to Keanu Reeves' character.There are scenes in Paris, New York and Berlin - topnotch cinematography that surpasses the other films. And the fight scenes are well scripted- kudos to the work Reaves and the stunt people put in to make them outrageously entertaining!Is this the last film in the series?Maybe... However if this brings in a ton of money rest assured there will be another one.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","scootm16","30 March 2023","As of now, this is the best movie of 2023; that being said, it still has it's issues. I'll start by saying the action sequences (all 9,000 of them) are breathtakingly choreographed. John Wick's trademarked 'GunFu' is on full display in Chapter 4 (for better or worse). This chapter easily has the highest body count out of the series, but you can't rely on bodies and bullets as your main focal point, especially if it's supposedly the last chapter (I highly doubt it is). Wick is weighed down by plot armor so thick it deflects literally everything, including the viewer's belief that Mr. Wick will ever be in any danger. Hit by 10 cars? Tis but a scratch!My main issue with Chapter 4 is that the plot is very thin and it's stretched out over 3 hours. This chapter is very 'Beginning. Middle. End'. The beginning and end are 5 minutes a piece, while the middle is two and a half hours of John effortlessly walking through goons (which is great, until it's not). I love me some Wick slaughtering goons, but when 95% of the movie is gun fire, you begin to forget what the plot even is, what the movie's even about, which is not good. This movie could've easily been cut down to 2 hours if they edited the fight scenes to a reasonable time, so I hope you don't like plot with your action.Another gripe I had is the fact that John Wick had like maybe 10 lines of dialogue? The guy barely spoke a word throughout the entirety of the movie, and when he did speak, 99% of the time it was him going ""Yeah..."" (which is great, until it's not). Maybe use Keanu/Wick as a vehicle for the plot instead of having him be a mute protagonist of an FPS video game? He's the title character for God sake! In Chapters 1 and 2, Wick showed a lot of emotion and vulnerability through dialogue and acting (at least more than this chapter) to express himself, but in this he is pretty much the Doomslayer. Also, is it just me or was Keanu's acting extra bad in this one? The line delivery sometimes was just... oof, even for Keanu standards.My favorite part of the movie is a top-down one-take scene near the end where Wick is blasting through goons with incendiary ammo.Overall, the movie is a good time and if you're a Wick fan, then you won't be disappointed. I'd say this is a step up from Chapter 3, but not as good as 1 and 2.7.2/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","subxerogravity","24 March 2023","Far better than I was expecting. Not that I thought it was going to be a bad movie in the slightest, but I was not expecting to be so bedazzled by it. John Wick has stepped up to the plate and hit that man meal out of the park every single time. Keanu Reeves and filmmaker Chad Stahelski have done everything in their power to keep the action constant.The odd part about that is that this movie did not have the best action sequences out of all the movies, but it did have the most in depth story. That itself is odd considering that John Wick movies are not about story. That is why this whole thing started over the fact that the son of some crime boss killed the dog his late wife gave him. It's a humorous plot that commits to the Franchise's statie of action film plots, but this movie decides to take itself a little more serious than all the others, really focusing on how far Wick has gone down the rabbit hole snice the first film. Surprising but not bad.Then you have the action, done by some of the best in the world. John Wick 4 feels like one of those episodes of the Mandalorian that's not about the Mandalorian at all. Afterall when you have Donnie Yen in the movie you want to make sure he's doing as many cool action sequences as possible, which means that there were a few times in this movie in which John disappears to allow others to shine. Great as far as the action.Also great, Scott Adkins in a fat suit. Now I want them to do a spin off movie with Scott Adkins in that fat suit.I would keep going but I do not want to be as long as the movie was. Do not worry you don't even notice. The film is too hard hitting for that.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","claudio_carvalho","13 June 2023","Since I joined IMDb in 2003, my reviews are composed by a summary without spoiler, opinion and the Brazilian title. ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is one of those movies where it is not possible to write a summary since there is no storyline, only stupid fights and shootings all the time, along almost three hours. There is also a tour in France and Germany, and nice scenarios simulating Japan. One of the most stupid scenes is when people continue to dance, despite the shootings and fights at the same place. John Wick is probably from Krypton, since he is gunshot, hit by at least five cars and jumps off buildings on the street and nothing happens to him. The dog ""Nuts"" is responsible for the best scene in this forgettable movie. Funny also to see is the Metascore and the IMDb ratings for this film. The sheeple believe in them. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""John Wick 4: Baba Yaga""","

Then in 2023, he's BACK to kill more guys. And let's not fool ourselves, there will be a 5th movie because why not. People keep drooling all over themselves because ""action"". This movie currently sits at a 8.0 on imdb, 0.2 below a classic action flick like Die Hard. That is actually ridiculous.At this point these movies are getting so silly I'm actually embarrassed to go watch another. I brought my girlfriend to the premiere of this movie and felt like a idiot the whole drive back because these movies have rid themselves of ANY meaningful dialogue, the script is actually objectively trash and the acting just isn't there. I was EMBARRASSED on the drive home from cinema. If this was any other movie it would get trashed, but because the first one was a pretty good revenge flick and because Reeves is so lovable this franchise gets a pass. I don't get how people parade this movie like some kind of awesome masterpiece when it's so obvious what a cash grab this is just riding on the back of the first movie. Do better.","

John wants to clear his name and be done with the table but the route of getting there this time is much harder a task than we have seen before.There are so many highlights of the movie, the action was all superb ! I already after first watch have a favourite which is hard to pick as there are some AMAZING sequences in the movie. I won't say the location because I want to give nothing away but I will say in Paris with a lot of traffic !This movie delves into the characters way more than before, we get really good time with the side characters, usually a movie like this would give them 10-15 minutes screen time and kill them while this isn't the case, in the time sense. We get motive, we get their struggle and really good interactions with John. My favourite side characters were Nobody, Shimazu, and Caine.John takes some hits, serious fall damage but these are the movies not real life hahaha. It's a spectacle on a grand scale.Very small nitpicks, the fights are all superb but I would like some more intimate fights for eg JW1, when they entered his house it felt more threatening, and that's it hahaha it's personal preference as a nitpick which is pretty darn good.JW4 is definitely the best of the sequels and up there with the first in my opinion! 8.5/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","JohnDeSando","24 March 2023","""You'll run out of bullets before they run out of heads."" Winston (Ian McShane with ascot)For John Wick: Chapter IV, the heads keep rolling, mostly decommissioned by the titular assassin's preternaturally accurate gun, and partly because it seems everyone now wears a bulletproof jacket often used as a shield. Hence the efficiency and necessity of one or two shots to the cranium. And very little blood, which I don't miss at all, given that, like sex, I don't need more than a glance to get it.As with most cinema, even impossibly successful runs like this thriller juggernaut, it's about storytelling even when it's about beautifully-choreographed fight sequences that mix martial arts with high-end weaponry that includes a ""dragon's breath shotgun""! The story is as old as movies themselves: global corporate hoodlums, The Table, are after assassin John Wick, a wicked former employee. The rep is the smarmy Marguis (Bill Skarsgard), decked out in three-piece suits, the brighter the better, and cravats louder than Winston's (thank you costume designer Paco Delgado).Wait till you see the wild-ass fight on a lengthy set of Parisian stairs or sit across from Killa (Scott Adkins, a martial arts expert), an almost sumo-sized card dealer. His silver teeth take us back to a memorable menace in the James Bond canon.It's all very stylish, no doubt because of returning director Chad Stahelski's penchant for colorful neo-noir and writers Shay Hatten and Michael Finch's ability to take the fantasy into new/old motifs such as a duel that Clint Eastwood would approve. They also supply lines like ""Second chances are the refuge of men who fail"" in a film where memorable dialogue is not what the audience expected.Who would expect set pieces such as combat in the Louvre and around the Arc de Triumph? Or better, who has a budget to afford those glories? Well, the producer of one of the most lucrative crime thriller series in cinema history that takes us to Germany, Japan, and France with ease.I can't predict if Keanu Reeves will return, he with a fortune now probably greater than Croesus' (I hear Reeves is generous with his wealth), because one of the great lines from John's Japanese friend, Shimazu ( Hiroyuki Sanada), in this murderous ballet is ""Have you given any thought to how this ends?""I have, and I hope it returns if it has more of the absurd style and beautiful ballet peppered with dialogue as sharp as the swords that dispatch very sharp baddies. John Wick: Chapter IV is as good as the best action films we will see all summer, and that bountiful crop has yet to start. Stay tuned.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","MrDHWong","23 March 2023","""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is the fourth film in the ""John Wick"" franchise. Once again directed by Chad Stahleski and starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, it stands out as not only the best film in the series but also as one of the very best action films made in recent decades.Shortly after the events of the third film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is in the planning stages of taking down the powerful High Table once and for all. After executing the Elder (George Georgiou), a man ranked above the High Table, John travels to Osaka to seek refuge in their local Continental Hotel. While there, John learns from the manager that his old blind friend Caine (Donnie Yen) and a bounty hunter known only as ""Mr. Nobody"" (Shamier Anderson) have each been ordered to assassinate him by a High Table member named Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd). As he fights off various other assassins, John eventually meets up with New York's Continental manager Winston Scott (Ian McShane), who may hold the key to disbanding the High Table permanently.Almost a decade since its debut, the ""John Wick"" series has cemented itself as one of the most popular action film franchises to ever grace movie theatres. The films are known for their highly stylised action scenes, memorable supporting characters, and intriguing world building elements that always make audiences come back for more. At the centre of it all is of course Keanu Reeves, who has helped the titular character become one of the most recognisable action heroes of all time. Now four films in, you would expect the series to show signs of losing some steam but ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" proves all doubters wrong with an exhilarating action-packed experience that leaves other similar films in the dust.Now that he's ""excommunicado"", the stakes are at an all time high as we see John facing off against even more dangerous adversaries than before. Anybody who's watched these films since the beginning will know that John's worldwide infamy makes it increasingly difficult for him to find allies willing to assist, especially considering how the bounty on his head keeps rising with every powerful enemy he makes. Because of that, there's more tension this time around than in previous entries, allowing less room for error at the risk of sudden death. Most of the time, John relies solely on his own wit and ingenuity to take out his enemies, whether it's with his simple handgun or with any part of the surrounding environment. John is a resourceful assassin, not blinding shooting at any moving target but instead calculating the right time and technique to take out a particular foe, no matter how minor. It is this trait that separates a character like John Wick from the rest of the typical action heroes, as contemplating his next move is what has made him so interesting to watch over the past four films.Something else I've admired about ""John Wick"" series is the attention-to-detail that goes into virtually every scene. Regardless of where things are taking place, there's so much visual beauty and creativity on display in each shot. This film is certainly no exception as it contains some truly breathtaking cinematography that places the audience right at the forefront of the action. If these scenes don't rejuvenate you, then you probably have no pulse. From the brightly coloured neon lights of Osaka to the raving nightlife of Berlin, every location oozes so much personality that they almost become characters in their own right. It is in these places that some of the best choreographed, best edited, and best filmed fight scenes in recent memory are able to firmly establish this fourth entry as one of the most exciting action films to ever be released in theatres. Yet despite all the frenetic shoot-outs and hand-to-hand combat, they are all handled with such careful precision that it is still easy to follow everything happening without losing focus of who is fighting who. And to top it all off, at no point is shaky cam ever used during the action scenes, which makes these already entertaining segments even better.For someone approaching his 60s, Keanu Reeves shows absolutely no signs of slowing down in the iconic lead role. Every shot that he fires, every punch that he throws, and every sword that he swings proves that Reeves can still hold his own alongside any younger cast members. There were even times where I couldn't help but notice some of the other supporting cast struggling to keep up with Reeves, which helped make him stand out quite considerably. Although the character of John Wick has never really had a huge amount of depth behind him, he definitely has a level of intrigue, something I think Reeves is able to play into perfectly. He is man of few words, whose widespread notoriety and respect from other assassins combined with his compassion for the defenseless makes him an endearing hero for the audience to cheer for. After all, it's easy to care about somebody who has risked everything to avenge the death of his dog.Additionally, I don't think the film would have worked half as well without John's two worthy opponents - Donnie Yen as Caine and Shamier Anderson as Mr. Nobody. Yen's depiction of Caine draws comparisons to that of Marvel's Daredevil, in that he is blind but a highly skilled martial artist relying on his other senses to defeat enemies. Caine's proficiency in combat is so unparalleled that each time I saw him fight I kept forgetting about his blindness since his reflexes are so unusually fast. However, what I liked most was the mutual respect between him and John, being that they were once close friends in the past. On the other hand, Mr. Nobody is completely different as he has no personal connection to John. He is only doing this job for the money but along the way he learns that John is a force to be reckoned with. It is interesting to watch how Mr. Nobody learns more about John as the film progresses, and Anderson successfully brings out all the necessary layers of curiosity surrounding his character.Even after four movies, the ""John Wick"" series is still as impactful as it was when it first started, with each film being better than the last. What began as a relatively straightforward story of a man seeking revenge against those who killed his dog is now a multi-layered, action-packed, and beautifully shot set of films that exists within its own meticulously crafted world. This fourth film has not only helped redefine the series as a whole but also what action movies are capable of in general. Personally, I would love to see another ""John Wick"" film but according to director Chad Stahleski, this will be the last one for a while with the spin-off film ""Ballerina"" and miniseries ""The Continental"" coming soon to fill the void in the meantime. Either way, it looks like this series is here to stay.I rate it a solid 9/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","A7medSalah","24 March 2023","As thrilling and relentless as any action movie before it, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an adrenaline injection with Oscar worthy stunt work, assured direction and Keanu Reeves as magnetic as ever. The best Chapter yet...John Wick: Chapter 4 feels like a film where Director Chad Stahelski understood that he finally had the freedom and the budget to do, literally, anything he wanted on the screen-and might never again-so by God, he was going to do it.With characters able to dodge bullets left, right and centre, the film is a homage to the classic martial-arts genre with a sprinkling of old Hollywood Westerns where protagonists never seem to run out of ammunition or ways to stay alive.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg√•rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years. It delivers more of what fans love about this series: stunning action sequences, cool visuals, charismatic performances, and intriguing lore. It also leaves room for more potential stories in this universe.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","gekkepoppetje","24 March 2023","I like to watch people getting killed. Give me a movie where people are getting killed for 3 hours and I'll be happy. Then you've come to the right place in Hollywood. Hollywood is for the mob what was once the arena in ancient Rome, but the light version. The rabble, ignorant, feasting on big screens where violence is shown as necessary, tough and sexy. John Wick is like American porn: do you like chocolate? Then we'll drown you in it. The film has a total lack of drama, a total lack of imagination and, even worse, a total lack of humour. After the umpteenth headshot I look bored at my lukewarm popcorn. Kenau Reeves, the Internet's darling of good deeds, plays a depressed killer in a black suit who does nothing but kill people. A feast to watch for the poor in spirit. Hollywood: we've got millions and what do we do? Portraying human ugliness like it is sexy.","

Who are they?) and then kills The Elder who's just sitting there, with very little fanfare in the middle of nowhere, no protection or even servants, I was immediately underwhelmed. This is supposed to be like a big deal, yet it felt meaningless.After that, it's just a bunch of barely credible fight scenes, over and over and over and over... All with convenient bulletproof clothing, and apparently none of these trained killers and thousands of bullets can hit the man's head. The cream of the crop is at the Arc de Triomphe, where he gets hit by four cars no less and just walks it off each time. Or where he jumps 4-5 stories high and slams his body basically head first on a parked car, and just walks that off too. Or when he falls down 222 stairs and walks THAT off.In the end, this is all just a cheap video game, where your character goes from set piece to set piece and has to shoot his way out; but in God mode.This thing is getting great reviews all over. What a low point we've come to.","

Sure it can be like that but in a good way. This franchise really does have so much to give and this fourth chapter is no difference. From the get go there's an explosion and tow close lives threatened. Wick comes back and we see the series latest villain played by Bill skarsgard, who is very convincing as one. The fights scenes are great as always especially the French Vs Asians fight. Also wick getting bolted down the stairs has some almost comic relief. Overall with the cast and everything John wick is still one of the greatest action series in modern times.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","benjaminskylerhill","23 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 joins Mad Max: Fury Road in being the fourth film in an action franchise that is also hands-down the best film in its franchise.The pacing issues present in the last two movies are nowhere to be seen here; remarkable, given the behemoth 169-minute runtime. It absolutely earns that runtime with action sequences that never once feel repetitive and a plot that is always moving.Every single gloriously carnage-filled set piece introduces unique geography, weaponry, and style to the mix so that every scene is more shocking and thrilling than the last. I can't remember the last time I was so consistently entertained for nearly three straight hours.This time around there are also several new characters introduced, and they're all given much more personality and narrative purpose than anything we've seen before in these films. For the first time in four movies, I actually got invested in the story on multiple levels rather than just being thoroughly entertained by the action.But it must also be acknowledged that this movie is absolutely insane, and is not meant to be taken seriously. John Wick is an invincible man, frequently surviving things no man can possibly survive. If implausibility bothers you, this will be your nightmare.The story does try to dive deeper into the theme of ""actions have consequences, and nobody is immune to consequences"" that was touched upon in the previous movies. I commend them for trying, but it's still done in a far too surface-level way to be impactful. The writers really glossed over some pretty heavy plot points whose consequences should have been explored in greater detail, and because of this, I didn't feel anything I think they wanted me to feel when the film ended.But this is a minor complaint for a movie like this. Chapter 4 is the display of a master action filmmaker who continues to dare to go bigger and bolder, and I can't wait to see what kind of spectacle he presents us with next.","

At times you could see stunt men missing their cues and their marks. Usually you can ignore it but violence was all this movie had so I expected better. Watching a stunt man stumble around for five seconds until Keanu was ready for him took me right out of it. For a movie that went to great lengths to advertise how the actions scenes were accomplished I felt cheated.The plot was laughable. Honestly I thought this movie would try to explain parts of the high table, gangs and why an American homeless man has millions of dollars in paintings stored in a train station in Paris.We heard someone snoring in the cinema.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","talking_about_movies","26 July 2023","I liked this movie much more than I thought I would. Long story short, no JW sequel has reached even close to what I felt during the 1st movie. While it's the same for this movie as well, I'm still surprised because I liked it more than both 2 and 3.First of all, let me get the problems out of the way. I still have the same problems as I did with most of the JW sequels. John Wick is able to fight 100 people in groups, and they don't attack simultaneously even when they can. An enemy waits till John Wick has finished fighting the other guy, and then makes his entrance. They wait till they are in close combat and then take out their gun, only to be disarmed by Wick. Seeing things like these again and again just takes away all the tension from the action scenes. And there isn't really much of a plot, nor is there much of a script. The more this series is continuing, the less I'm caring about the characters.But you know what, that's enough for flaws. I still had a lot of fun watching this movie. I absolutely adored the way Chad Stahelski filmed the action scenes. There's a long action scene in a certain house, and we get to see a view from above, making the length of the scene even cooler. The action set pieces, not scenes, but the set pieces are awesome. Seriously, so cool. There's an action scene that takes place on the road around a roundabout - easily my favourite scene in the movie and one of the best action scenes I've seen in recent times. And this is a 3-hour movie, so it has like 2.5 hours worth of action. The entire movie is just full of action. And I had a lot of fun seeing many different, innovative action set pieces along with the way Stahelski directed them. There are a few interesting new characters as well, that actually stole the show from John.Overall this movie had some very innovative action scenes, some charismatic new characters and I had plenty of fun watching it. But it's still in the same bucket as the rest of the sequels, even if it's better than them.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","jancapek-cz","26 March 2023","I really liked this film. For the first 90 minutes or so. Then, as the body count exceeded what I thought to be roughly 15 thousand souls, I started to feel like I was missing out on life. The feeling grew exponentially, with every batch of 5 thousand casualties.When John Wick began his ascent to the top of Sacr√© Coeur, where he faced a hundred new villains (probably the planet's last surviving human male specimens), I considered leaving. But it was Mr. Nobody yelling his ""balls"" cormmand (whereupon his dog jumps at a man's crotch, and then urinates over his dead body) that achieved the feat.On my way home, I reminisced about the good old days, when an action-loaded, far-fetched but highly entertaining movie could be squeezed into 87 minutes (e.g. Commando, 1985; btw. 51% of the running time of John Wick: Chapter 4).Anyway, ChatGPT informs me that ""There is no clear evidence to suggest that watching stupid films or any other form of entertainment can significantly lower a person's IQ,"" so it's not all bad. But I lost good lunch money and 3 hours of my life, and there's no refund on these.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","AnotherRandomReviewer","11 October 2023","I loved the first John Wick movie and while the second one had problems, I like how they expanded the lore of the assassin's guild he was part of. Then in John Wick 3 the lore, story and characters all started to be massively overshadowed by the action. And then we get John Wick 4, the video game.Or should I say John Wick the super hero movie because he might as well be one because he is so unkillable. Anyways, every scene has a perfunctory bit of acting just to set the stage for massively overlong and frankly ridiculous action scenes. John Wick is supposed to be good at fighting but no person is so good that they can take down masses of near-peer skilled enemies. By the end of the movie I was looking at the clock when the action scenes were happening.And don't get me started on the massively stupid trope of the blind assassin that is in this movie. Just stop it already. The guy hunting Wick does things over and over again that are simply impossible. It was just ridiculous that we are supposed to believe he would last more than a few seconds against a skilled, assassin trained opponent.Overall, the movie is a steep disappointment. It was stylishly filmed and is a treat visually, the acting is not bad, and the fights are good to a point but then they go on and on and on so you lose interest.This should be the last John Wick film. And for anyone who is thinking about watching the series for the first time, just stop after the first. That's all you need. The rest is downhill.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","nscoby93","24 March 2023","John Wick: Chapter 4 as with the past three films continues to develop its world, its characters, goes bigger with the amazing action set pieces, and amazing fight chrography.One of my biggest concerns going into this film was its run time as I have felt the John Wick movies do not garner a two plus hour film so if they want to do a movie that's damn near three hours then the story needed to deliver...And I am very happy to say they delivered with great storytelling.The film did not start as fast as I anticipated it would but instead opened up establishing new characters and its story. In fact John was barely in the first half hour of the movie which I was surprised by but it was a very welcome change of pace.The action sequences are bigger and better than we have ever seen before, they've always managed to top themselves movie to movie and Chapter 4 is no different.But the absolute standout action sequence for me is in this abandoned French home in the third act of the film. It was fantastically choreographed, and the camera work was phenomenal and truly unique. Whatever the camera crew is making its not enough.Some certain issues for me, where as I didn't feel the run time for the most part I did begin to feel fatigue during an action sequence in the third act. It felt prolonged to me and I just wanted to move forward with things. But the movie never felt to have dragged and was entertaining and engaging through its entire run time.Lastly I would like to say some words about the recently passed Lance Riddick. While his character Charon was small, his impact was anything but small. The John Wick world, and The Continental Hotel will not be the same without it's courteous and always professional concierge, he will be missed! As Winston said...""He was a friend""If this is the final Chapter in the John Wick storyline then I am very pleased with its conclusion but as I mentioned there's plenty of opportunity for more in this world.IMDb: 9/10

Not nearly as good as the other 3 movies. If they would have given us a little more background on some of the new characters it would have made more sense and given them more depth. In previous movies John would use his Krav Magra skills to take down or slow down someone then a double tap to the head would usually be sufficient. Those fight scenes were outstanding and believable. Almost all of fights in this movie ridiculous. People were shot and stabbed several times and looked like they weren't hurt. How many times did John get hit by a car and just walked away? How many times do you have to hit someone in the face with nunchucks before they go down. I used to think John was special. The Baba Yaga. But in this version he is made to look almost invincible. Really, did they have to get so far away from reality this time. I left somewhat disappointed.

There were a few creative aspects to the fight scenes, cinematography and effects, but in terms of the writing the whole movie was just one long incessant fight scene repeated what felt like hundreds of times without any story to break it up or make any of it matter at all to the viewer. In action movies it's obviously about the action and not much is needed to make the story 'matter' but my goodness at least have the basics of an actual story that makes the action compelling in some basic way. There were a number of excellent actors in this movie but sadly the writing made it so that even they couldn't contribute anything to the story. Went in excited but I seriously wanted to walk out about half way through when I realized it was just going to be non-stop fight scenes and nothing else for 3 whole hours.

John Wick: Chapter 4 breathes new life into the franchise, evolving from the simplicity of its origins to a dazzling globetrotting spectacle. The once straightforward narrative has given way to a complex web of characters and a runtime that'll test your bladder's limits.Gone are the simple days of the first film. In their place, we're treated to a symphony of the most elaborate action sequences the series has seen. John's departure in the third installment would suggest consequences, but he's back, more formidable than ever, training to unleash hell on his adversaries. The film begins dramatically, setting the tone for the adrenaline rush to come.Bill Skarsg√•rd's Marquis Vincent de Gramont enters the fray, and the story moves to Osaka, introducing the captivating performances of Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen. Their martial arts skills and character depth elevate the film, with Yen's smart action blending seamlessly with well-placed humor, while Sanada exudes his signature honor.From the Osaka battle, the action ramps up, treating us to a visual feast of various combat styles. The film takes us on a global journey as John strives to reclaim his standing, encountering memorable characters along the way. Scott Adkins in prosthetics and a change of scenery to France further diversify the action-packed narrative.As the film barrels towards its climax, it finds a welcome respite in an old-school type of action, offering a satisfying balance between the serious tone of the first film and the ludicrousness of the third. Chad Stahelski and his team manage to strike this delicate balance, leaving us enthralled by brilliant choreography.While the endless fight scenes might feel repetitive on repeat viewings, the film's end credits tantalizingly hint at the possibility of more to come. Personally, I'd be content with leaving it here, but the allure of financial success may bring the franchise back to the screen before long. In the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers a heart-pounding ride that manages to honor its roots while pushing the boundaries of its action-packed universe.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 10/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","judealexharnett","6 January 2024","I have to say that I feel really let down by this movie. The first three films in this series were brilliant and I had high hopes for this one but I can say that It met them. First off the opening half an hour in this film may be one of my favourites ever. All the samurai and stuff against The high table agents was just so cool.Unfortunately I believe the movie went down from there. For the most part it was the same as the last movie. John wick is excommunicado and being hunted down but has a couple allies and even more enemies. The dialogue in this movie is extremely short but if say its pretty well done. However this movie being so narratively weak and nearly 3 hours long is not a good thing in my opinion. Even with all the action scenes i felt the movie crawling along for a large portion of the film.Im gonna be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of the ending either. Now I do understand the fact that John came to terms with the fact that he needed to embrace death and all of that but it just felt so underwhelmed due to how much fighting and murdering he went through in the past 3 movies to not die. Also like this dude has been shot, stabbed, hit with several cars and fell at least 50 feet and landed on his back, yet 3 bullet wounds kill him? A bit silly if you ask me. 8/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","nashezzubair","7 January 2024","When you start watching a John Wick movie, you expect it to be a non stop action ride. Thats true for this 4th chapter in the most John Wick way possible and we wouldn't have it any other way.Keanu Reeves' silent assassin John Wick is always a treat to watch. People do complain about his lack of dialogue but in this setting it works to his advantage as the action tells most of the story. John Wick is a force of nature, something everybody fears to be the other side of his gun. And in this movie, its maximum carnage from him.Can't believe that 4 movies in and the director Chad Stahelski and his stunt choreography team haven't let us get bored of the action yet. Its surprisingly refreshing in every movie and each builds on top of the previous one, raising the bar higher. The story's tightly knit too, so you feel like the fight scenes organically come out of it and never feel forced.An amazingly entertaining watch, as expected from the John Wick movies.","

I had to wait in the theater for a long time because I was just so blown away by how well made this film was.The lighting has evolved with each movie and it was absolutely stunning. And that goes along with the cinematography. Just absolutely beautiful shots. And of course the choreography was incredibly well orchestrated. AND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE STUNTS.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","TxMike","7 August 2023","This movie opens with a scene of John Wick riding a horse in a desert somewhere in an Arab country, he is shooting at several men riding horses ahead of him. After killing all of them he meets a man on a rug in the desert, after a few minutes kills him execution style. All in the first 6 minutes, and we have no idea why.As the movie progresses we see additional execution style killings. My biggest question at that point was ""Why does a really nice guy in real life, Keanu Reeves, so willingly play a character that has no regard for the lives of others?"" Is it just for the big payday?The way IMDb sorts user reviews here, the ""featured"" reviews are stacked by ""helpful"", which really means ""do you agree with the review?"" Almost all of them rate this movie rather low, typically ""3"" or ""4"", yet the overall rating is 7.8 at this writing. That is a disconnect.I suppose all those who consider this to be a superior movie also just enjoy seeing a supposedly ""good guy"" kill lots of supposedly ""bad guys"", in a ""judge, jury, and executioner"" type of role. Well this sort of movie is not for me. I don't enjoy that. While the production values are high the movie itself is not that good.I watched it at home on DVD from my public library. About the first John Wick, which I watched in 2015, I wrote in part ""... this kind of movie glorifies point-blank execution killing justified because the guys being killed work for a Russian mafia in New York. But it still cheapens life and we simply have too much of that in our movies.""So nothing has changed. I didn't see Wick 2 and Wick 3 and now I have no desire to.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","adhipar","27 March 2023","This movie has the same plot as before: John Wick against the rest of the assassin world with longer running time. What is good with a longer duration is the characters can be well developed, and I really like that Donnie Yen, Shamir Anderson, Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins have enough time to show their acting. Especially Donnie and Scott. Hiroyuki/Henry Sanada has seriously acted on several movies so he's natural.Another benefit with longer duration is of course more actions! However, I'm a bit dissapointed about this, because it doesn't mean that to make it longer, those henchmen should be too hard too kill as if they were zombies which you need to punch, kick, throw, shot on the knee, leg, abdomen, chest and finally their head to finally died. For those troops with full body armor (in Continental hotel set) this is still logical. But for those thugs in Paris who were not use a bulletproof suits, this become silly. I don't understand why John Wick didnt try to break their neck or shot their heads to quickly eliminate them.Not only those thugs are zombies, John Wick should also a zombie since he fell from 2nd/3rd floor several times, get stabbed, punched kicked, hit by car also several time, fall down and roll over on hundreds of steps and still can get up and seems fine.And I totally loss it when there's a shooting duel, with one of the participant is blind!. I really want the movie to be finished asap.However, as I said, the character development is nice and the gun-fu which are shot from above from room to room is also memorable. I quite enjoyed them. 7/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","waltermwilliams","27 March 2023","More talk of High Tables blah, blah, blah let's get on with the action!There is plenty of that in ""John Wick: Chapter 4"".This was only meant to be a trilogy, but who can argue a 4th chapter when your franchise is a license to print money?Keanu Reeves is back as John Wick of course and even shares what eulogy he'd like on his tombstone when and if that day comes.Also accompanying him is Ian McShane as ""Winston"" The Manger of the Continental Hotel. That sliver in New York.Its concierge is still Lance Reddick as ""Charon"".The wonderful actor and voice actor who died recently at age 60, which makes his appearance even sadder.The villain of this instalment is one of modern cinemas finest, Bill Skarsgard as ""Marquis"".If you loved him as ""Pennywise"" in ""IT"" just wait to see if the balloons all float down here too in Wickland.Hiroyuki Sanada is a fine actor who heads up the Osaka Hotel in Japan as ""Shimazu"" where some of the best action takes place.Plus of course Lawrence Fishburne as the ""Bowery King"" and tailor to Johnathon...especially the 42 regular Kevlar suit.Donnie Yen is back as ""Caine"".Proving even a blind man can tell when he's walking in the Sun or shooting bad guys using door bells.Shamier Anderson is ""The Tracker"" or ""Mr Nobody"" who with the help of his faithful killer dog takes care of business as a gun for hire.Clancy Brown with his marvellous bass/baritone voice is ""The Harbinger"" of mostly bad news.One unbelievable death defying fight scene after another plays out during the longest ""John Wick"" chapter ever at 2hrs 49 minutes...especially considering this movie was designed to be seen on IMAX screens where times should be much shorter.Watch out for: The Arc de Triomphe car chase battle scene and the 200 plus stairs fight.The sound engineering is first class with a great soundtrack.You simply have to throw logic out the door to fully comprehend what's happening on the big screen and just enjoy the ride.It's a thriller and possibly one of the best in this saga that started in 2014.Maybe ""John Wicks"" farewell tour is finally coming to an end.Keanu at 59 is still being excellent to his mates and proving deadly to his enemies, but even Wick can't kill everyone.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","MisterJxroen","23 March 2023","I was fortunate enough to view 'John Wick: Chapter 4' in a double-bill (Chapter 3 prior to 4) avant-premiere screening at the theater with my family. I've always been a great admirer of the practical action sequences portrayed in the 'John Wick' films.Undoubtedly, 'John Wick Chapter 1' remains my favorite, followed closely by Chapter 3. It definitely has something to do with the fact that the type of action and gun-fu felt so new back then. That is also the one main thing this fourth film suffers from in my opinion: innovativeness. Though this issue only really exists throughout the first half of the film.The Paris sequences & pretty much all action sequences featuring Donnie Yen (as 'Caine') serve as a breathe of fresh air in this film. Some new weapons and technology such as the bow & arrow, the nunchucks and some fancy incendiary bullets make certain action scenes a joy to watch. Though the other sequences are certainly cool, I can't help but feel like I've seen it quite a few times already.The cinematography was definitely at it's highest point in this fourth film. The movie was absolutely gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and ultramodern, almost in a science fiction-y way. The way action sequences are shot have always been amazing; from long takes to overhead shots, back to running between cars on the Champs-Elysees and dueling like it's the wild west. It's a lot of bloody fun! I'm slightly saddened by the fact so much action was shot in dark and distractingly lit environments, but overall the practicality of it all was still there.I enjoyed the music more in the prior movies, though I haven't separately listened to the OST yet so I know what to do. Sound design, costumes and world building is another massive win for me. I love this world they've managed to create full of assassins and strange people. It was nice to explore so many different countries and 'continentals'. It really helped with making this film different from the others.Keanu Reeves is always a joy to watch, what else can I say? I'm also very happy they brought in legends like Clancy Brown, Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada. Their skills and overall badass vibes just fit so fell in this world. Speaking of legends, I'm saddened by the recent passing of Lance Reddick, who portrayed 'Charon' the concierge. I'm glad to have seen him one last time in this role and I pay my respects.Overall I rate this film a 8/10, on par for me with chapter 2. If you come to see John Wick absolutely kicking people's ass while also breaking his own back numerous times (you'd think), this is the right film for you. You don't really get a lot of opportunities to breathe, and I love it.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","terrylarosa","29 March 2023","The Wick films now have something in common with another popular franchise; the Road Runner cartoons. Wick is now more invulnerable than Wolverine. Last movie they dropped him off of a building. In this one they do the same but why stop there; they drop him off two buildings with nary a scratch. Wick just gets up and keeps on killing. Who cares right? Certainly not reviewers and critics who are giving this cartoonish movie high praise. But why stop there? Let's let him get hit by no less than 4 moving cars that would have shattered bones in a mere mortal. But let's go for more. Let's drop him not once but twice down hundreds of stairs only for him to get up and kill dozens more. My wife ( having loved the first 3 ) was thoroughly disgusted with this movie and I was quite dismayed myself. Wick peaked in the second brilliant one but they turned this into a stupid Fast and Furious movie defying what punishment a body can take. Wick is not hurt once except in the final gun battle. The movie gets a few stars for the cinematography, stunts and the great first big action action scene in Japan with the equally great Hiroyoki Sanada. Sadly the movie goes downhill from there. Watch for cartoon fun only.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","therealjaysmoke","23 May 2023","Finally got the chance to watch this movie and I have to say, everything you'd expect from a John Wick movies, you got it. From the cinematography to the color grading, to the special Fx. So I wasn't moved by that at all. We all know that 3 was bad, but 4 was abysmal. I don't know what the directors were thinking making the main antagonist, Caine, a BLIND man. I mean, how were you going to sell this to fans of John Wick who know him to be am amazing gunslinger? And you telling me, he can't shoot a blind man dead from a few yards away? What load of rubbish is that? That spoilt the whole movie for me.And then you had Mr Nobody, who I really didn't understand what he was doing in the movie with his dog. Then you had all the awful and predictable fight scenes. It was such a pain to watch, you could tell it wasn't real as the fighters would pause, waiting for Keanu to make a move then they responded. I don't know if it was Keanu who was slow or what, it was just wrong. And the Marquis guy's acting was just terrible.The story was very weak IMO, not as rich as the first and second. This is the 4th chapter, I was expecting something rad! But everything here we've seen before in previous John Wick movies, the only crazy moment was the unexpected death of Winston's concierge.My conclusion is a simple question: how hard is it for a whole John Wick to shoot a blind man?","

At least, acting is not needed as much as stunts. I mean, the action scenes are - how can I put this delicately - impossible or borderline fantasy level unless the whole film is in The Matrix, and also the third film, of course.The character development does not exist, physics does not defy John Wick ever. The opposite cannot be said, though.Even if you turn off your brain and watch, most of it does not make sense, at all.However, if you are into mindless, illogical action scenes, John Wick is the film for you.One more thing, in a gun fight, if you lose to a guy who cannot see, in brightly lit environments, maybe you should give up your career as an assassin. If not, you deserve to get killed in ""action"". One intriguing character was Mr. Nobody, unfortunately, though, the writers bestowed upon him the part of Martha (Batman vs Superman) in this movie.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","CinemaClown","26 July 2023","An almost perfect sequel & by all means a fitting finale too, John Wick: Chapter 4 continues the tradition of the franchise going bigger, better & bolder with every subsequent instalment, and is action filmmaking at its most balletic, ballistic & breathtaking. Featuring some truly spectacular set pieces & stellar action choreography, all the while raising the stakes as the story progresses, this fourth entry is an expertly crafted & ingeniously executed offering that delivers on all fronts.Directed by Chad Stahelski, the story presents death's very emissary embarking on a Sisyphean mission of suicidal fury after the events of the last film and is more dramatically compelling than before. Stahelski continues to find new, creative & audacious ways to make the action stand out and takes ideas & inspirations from several classics of the past. There is a sense of urgency this time around that makes the unfolding events all the more restless and keeps the interest alive at all times.The reprising cast is impressive as before but the new additions manage to make their mark too, with Donnie Yen stealing the show among the latter. Reeves is captivating throughout and plays his role with panache. Bill Skarsgard delivers as a worthy villain. And the upgrades in set design & cinematography are notable enough to stand out. Also, after all the merciless bloodbath that ensues before, the decision to end the journey with a traditional duel is a masterstroke that only makes the finale better.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 earns high scores in every aspect and is one of the most pristine & polished examples of blockbuster filmmaking. Making all the genre elements work in absolute harmony to deliver an action extravaganza of the highest order, this immaculately orchestrated dance of death is one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences of the year that effortlessly lives up to its enormous hype and smartly brings the saga of the man, the myth & the legend to a satisfying conclusion.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Tweetienator","2 June 2023","Well, the first one was real fun and is still the real deal, the other two I can't remember much of but that there was a lot of shooting and fighting and running going on. John Wick: Chapter 4 just provides more of the same and I must state - I was rather indifferent and slightly bored while watching. Don't get me wrong - acting is sufficient, production fine, and there is a lot of action, but the story, well, all that blabla about the High Table and so on, is just redundant noise to set up the stage for different and exotic settings for more bumbum. I really think they should have left the first movie alone. That one is still cool and hot but like the Taken (Liam Neeson) movies with every added ""chapter"" the idea and quality of the story and character thins out. And last but not least, almost three hours running time is something like an overkill ;)","

Donnie Yen and Rina Sawayama's fights were just wow. And some of the shots, although ridiculous, did look beautiful (I'm talking about the club scene where people were still dancing, while the dude next them got axed in the face or Wick doing doughnuts around a bunch of cars with endless bullets), looks great and cool and aesthetically pleasing but after a while, it does make you roll your eyes.It's becoming too outrageous that it's laughable now, getting closer to the fast and furious franchise, which is a shame. When it's so silly, you become less invested in the characters it makes the long ass fight scenes just plain boring. Where it lost points for me is; 1 for the plot, 1 for the dialogue , 1 for Keanu's acting and 1 for the sheer silliness of it all.

Things like falling from a four story building on to a VW van and walking away, hit by a car (several times) and walking away, brutal fight scenes and walking away, it's all humanly impossible to be considered real.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","John94","3 June 2023","The latest edition of John Wick follows the same disappointing footsteps of Chapter 3. The first two John Wick movies were the best because they were more grounded and realistic. Their plot even though it was simple and straightforward it made way more sense than the latest two movies. Having also better writing, being more focused and having better villains helped them quite a lot. Also the fight scenes were far better than this movieAs we see in Chapter 4 the John Wick franchise follows the same path the Fast and Furious movies took. The first movies were the best for obvious reasons as i mentioned above and the more deep they expanded their universe and characters the more dumb the movies became. In this movie we have Daredevil fighting enemies without breaking a sweat and John seems to have complete invulnerability like he is Superman. There isn't any tension, or a sense of thrill or dread and fear in any of the fight scenes they show. The fight scenes in the first two chapters were way better because John/Keanu reacted faster so age does play an important role and most importantly they were directed better being more grounded and realistic. Being smaller scale helped them shine more, and in this one being having big scale set pieces wasn't the best choice. Moreover the villains in this movie they are straight from a fan-fiction cartoon acting incredible dumb, having the worst lines possible that it becomes not fun to watch at all. And don't make me laugh, i cringed so much with the dog and the guy who chases John especially in his last couple of scenes.I generally don't recommend this movie at all and if you are a truly fan of the action genre that respects both the writing and the choreography and fight scenes of these movies i don't recommend this one at all. At least this movie had great cinematography so that's a positive. But in all other aspects from writing, directing and pacing, it did such a bad job.","

Never before have I seen a movie where the opponents are so obviously taking turns attacking. There are countless scenes in this movie where John Wick is fighting multiple opponents and every one except the one he is currently fighting is dancing around awkwardly in the background until its their turn to attack. It's infuriating. And it happens constantly throughout the movie.Now, not everything about the action is bad. Some of the fight scenes are awesome, mostly the ones where he is fighting someone one on one.The camera work, scenery, set design are all beautiful. Even the story of this installment is better than what we had previously. The movie also introduces a couple of fantastic new characters and the conclusion is quite satisfying.All that to be completely underminded by the truly atrocious fight choreographies throughout the movie.

like him getting revenge for the dog was alrighjt, everybody was rooting for him for sure... but then.. it lost its purpose..and then this movie .. dude, come on, why 3 if it was that easy.. i mean, it wasnt easy but it the possibility of the duel existed in the first place? And how conveniently this marquis was hiding in a corner waiting for his turn to appear... kinda like the eternals during the whole Thanos event.. they said they couldnt interfere.. but wait, their whole purpose was to use Earth to do something I wont say for spoiler purpose.. but you know, made no sense than not helping the avengers... but anyway, this marquis and the duel should have happened in the movie before.. or not at all like i said lol..
could have gone with wick saving someone or whatever.. i dont know..imho, he is still alive but I imagine there wont be another one... unless this movie gets $$$$$ worlwide box office and then maybe.","

I can't unsee any of it.It looks painfully unnatural compared to how well the previous 3 films handled the fighting.There's a ton of wasted movement and shot decisions based on making a scene look ""pretty"" rather than ""good.""I know they can do better. I've seen it.A couple cute twists of the story doesn't really carry the rest of the film, but it was at least still entertaining.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","hectordanielbuelna","25 March 2023","After the pleasant success John Wick was, the creators somehow managed to made their magnum opus John Wick 2, the best one by far, where the whole idea of the unstoppable legendary assassin gets fully realized.In this movie, however, just like in the last one they tried making the action more bombastic by giving the villain ""all the power in the world"", not only overcomplicating the whole lore of the assasins guilt (once again) but also turning the whole action of the movie into a cartoonish mess.Once again the Baba Yaga gets turned into a damage sponge who keeps just walking off been thrown off high buildings, getting run over, punched and hit with multiple objects and still winning every fight by the power of deus ex machina.The pacing of the action is just horrible, every 5 minutes there's a random fight and Wick keeps barely making it out alive but they keep expecting you take this crap seriously! Forget how awesome and practical gun-fu was in the first film, this time everyone has magical bullet proof clothing that just makes the fights longer and the whole choreography less believable.There are a couple of great cinematic and tense scenes (I specifically loved the sword fight NOT involving Wick and the scene where the camera is on the ceiling inside the abandoned building). Sadly there's a ton of things I hated: the almos 3 hour duration, the whole retcon and rush to stablish a new villain, the weak motivations gor said villain, the blind guy with superpowers, the needless ""tracker"" guy and his dog, the amount of random and long fighting scenes that just kept going and kept happening... So bad.","

And I was so disappointed.The movie is so drawn out and it's just doesn't make sense to me - there wasn't any clear intention for any character's actions - like why Nobody and Caine kept changing his mind over whether he should kill Wick or not? The killing over time just became repetitive - Wick just got away with many falls and attacked with virtually no harm at all. Many many more plot holes made this movie a pain to watch.And then I read that Chapter 4 is the only movie not written by the original screenwriter. And then it made all the sense in the world.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Andrewmcal","11 June 2023","Talentless writers ruin another film! I thought John Wick 3 was a huge disappointment, but John Wick 4 maybe the dullest action film ever.Keanu Reeves is a national treasure, but his heart wasn't in this one and it showed. Almost 60 and looking about 35, he punches and shoots his way through the baddies. But, without a script of worth to give his actions meaning, everything he does seems empty and flat. I fell asleep during one of the later action scenes to give you context on just how uninteresting the action in this film came across. Which is a shame, because I'm sure a bunch of people put a ton of work into it. But, if your fight scenes are inspiring me to grab a nap, what the hell?All the actors turned in quality performances. And, it was wonderful to see Clancy Brown again. But, the screenplay couldn't be saved. It was lazy, flat, and highlighted the lack of skill and imagination of the films writers. Shay Hatten is no Derek Kolstad!Visually it was very pretty, but it was the cinematic version of plastic fruit. If you haven't invested your time in the other films, give it a miss. It's not even worth watching as background for cooking.If the makers of John Wick: Chapter 4 read this, I want my money and time back!","

This movie trashes it completely and does away with respected conventions. In no world does this movie need to exist, but if it does, it needs to be tighter, and with better direction for the cast.Most of our enjoyment came from Donnie Yen's performance., and each time Ian McShane opened his mouth enough to show us his ridiculous veneers.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Boristhemoggy","24 May 2023","I remember watching the Matrix series films and thinking the sheer silly volume of attackers all at once, and yet Neo manages to overcome them all. Some of the scenes were well choreographed, but by Matrix 3 I was fast forwarding through scenes as it was the same blocking, throwing, shooting of people repeated over and over. It got to the point where it was overkill if you'll pardon the pun.With John Wick 3 I said the same thing. There's one thing being John Rambo, but at least it was believable, at a stretch.Neo and John Wick are both unbelievable and frankly beginning to be boring. They're all just the same.I watched this one as I hoped for something a bit better but all it is is violence, errors, continuity problems and ridiculous scenarios.It's mildly entertaining I think because the acting is mostly OK and production values are high. But as an action film it leaves an awful lot to be desired.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","capitanotm","24 March 2023","I am a big big John Wick fan. When i first saw it i was in love with the character and the idea and the freshness it brought to the table of action genre.We spend few last days before movie arrived in high expectations and when we saw 9/10 rating on imdb we were like this will be HUGE! Couldn't wait to watch, since we really liked all the previous ones.First three movies were amazing, they were progressing well, John had deeper and deeper character build, as did other character get, everything went very very good. First three movies were 8-8.5 even 9 at some points.This one was crazy downfall. I can see everyday rating is getting lower and lower and i guess someone payed a ton of people to write similar fake ratings to build momentum until it does what i now think it is made for - make as much money as possible.Nonsense, unrealistic scenes that went stupid, fighting which felt like they are preparing and training for real scenes to be taken, completely brainless involvement of blind man as an ultra killer who as it points in the movie is better than John himself.I mean i can write real real long text about dozens and dozens problems with this movie. We are supposed to have some fantasy level of skills here, but just some level, a believable level, this went way beyond even strongest superheroes strength level at some points and i am not kidding! Its ridiculous!!!Main villain is nonsense, its just so illogical in this universe. I was really really hoping that they can explore that Arabic part of the universe, fighting the Elders stronger snd stronger Elders, really exploring that mysterious part of universe, but no, he kills Elders like they are nothing, and then his main villain becomes young childish egomaniac that basically has no skills and no one knows how or why he reaches ultimate position at the Table. Crazy!!!Ending is rushed as many parts of the movie, and feels utterly disappointing and unsatisfying, only good thing to some degree is scenes with Scott ""unrecognizable"" Adkins.Keanu seems were off for the whole movie, like he has no energy, and he does more than superheroes do in this one, its just cringe after cringe after cringe. Disgusting what they did with movie and character!To all John Wick fans who waited this so long and were si excited to see it.. you don't need to. Definitely not paying for it in cinemas! Stick to the first three movies and make some happy ending in your head. This is EPIC FAIL.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","blackknight-51234","4 November 2023","If you enjoy watching other people play video games then you'll definitely enjoy this.There's lots of action, weapons and style - all the things we've come to expect from a John Wick film.Of course it's ridiculous - all of them are. The mere idea that you can deflect bullets with a jacket lapel gives you an indication of how far from reality this film is. Keanu Reeves sustains what would be critical injuries half a dozen times - and shakes it off without any ill effects.With one exception, the amount of damage a character can sustain appears to be directly related to how important they are to the story. Most of the victims in the extensive gun battles (at one point it appears Keanu Reeves is single-handedly depopulating Paris) are gone after a couple of shots. If you have a speaking part then you can take much more damage than any of the extras.The whole idea of the ""secret assassin society"" only works if you don't draw attention to yourself"". So having a full blown Blackwater Contracting reunion at the Arc de Triumph isn't exactly the best way of keeping things on the down low.Throw in a Mr Chow-esque (from the hangover) character and then deciding to make him blind really shows how silly things have got. Last time I checked, gunfighting requires you to be able to at least the person you want to shoot. That said, he is at least still more convincing than Ruby Rose was.The first John Wick film was such a hit because the audience felt a connection with his loss and wanted him to be successful seeking revenge on what were some nasty (if ineffective) bad guys. At this point I'm not really sure what John Wick is supposed to be fighting for. He just lurches from one noir styled location to the next before embarking on an unrestrained killing spree, leaving dozens dead in his wake - you wonder if these people have families.If you liked the second and/or third film, then you'll like this. It requires little to no thought and the plot is as by the numbers as you'd expect.That said, the action, although resembling a video game, is very well shot, there's lots of cool locations and stylish outfits. Despite the tactical nonsense and the fact that the bad guys wait in line for their turn to attack him, Keanu Reeves has genuine skill in martial arts and pistol shooting.It's as constructive a use of time as playing 3 hours of Call Of Duty in your best suit.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","taz1004","3 June 2023","Yes I know what the franchise is about. I don't expect realism from John Wick movie. But some things are just outright ridiculous. How is it that their suits deflect bullets but they get hurt so bad by nunchuck? Don't tell me it's because they're hit on the head. They were hit on the arm and the back and still got hurt more than gunshots. I'm assuming that's supposed to be comedy? I wasn't sure as it wasn't clear.In 2nd or 3rd one they said once the ticket is torn, there's no way back but now it turns out it's really easy to get back? Just had to kill a guy? I liked the first John Wick because the story was simple. But now the story is just stupid.I guess the appeal is all the action scenes but they're soooo repetitive that it really gets boring. Especially if you watch all 4 in a row. No, I didn't binge all 4 in a row but watched 1 per weekend because my daughter didn't see the first 3 and wanted to watch the 4th. And it was still too repetitive that by the 3rd movie, I was ready to skip them.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","danielbrown-47106","30 May 2023","First one was undeniably glorious in so many ways including being somewhat of a homage to the Neo we never got because sequels notoriously tend to fail dismally regardless of how good the first movie was, such was the case with Matrix and I'm sad to say, such is the case with John Wick too. JW2 was pretty good though, albeit ridiculous and farfetched.. 3 was ok, but felt like much of the same. Now just watching 4 I'm literally bored.. and I love martial arts, guns, tactical training and Japanese culture.. All this ""round table"" ho-ha is bonkers and Keanu as much as I love the guy is clearly slowing down a lot now whilst enemy's around him do that real obvious dance that makes them appear like they're attacking to the best of their ability but in reality they're just making movement and waiting their turn to be blitzed one by one. The filming style too feels overdone and old. Like watching Matrix now in 2023 and seeing the fight scenes look like something straight out of a WB studio drenched in PG infused unrealism, JW has suffered much the same fate.. although both the Matrix and JW were once mind blowing pieces of art, now they're both like stale bread..","

1. JW suit appears to be a tank armor, if you forget any physics law and has no idea what a gun is, ok, otherwise even Rambo movies are more realistic.2. The Table has all the best assassins in the world and a blind guy is able to kill everyone without being shot. Seriously?3. Every enemy when hit once by a car dies, except for JW which is hit by I don't know, more than 20 cars and keep walking normally... hey, what? ""God-mode on""
4. Hundreds of people shoot JW but he is not hit even once! Not in the head, not in the hand which he uses to hold the suit, not anywhere...
5. When shots are being taken, the bullets make metal noise when hitting the suit... so, is the suit made of metal? If that was true, it would have no malleability, he would walk like Robocop.I found it to be a really bad movie because it became too unrealistic. If you don't mind about reality and just wanna see someone in a suit shooting tons of people, you will probably like it.","

I was so let down the fights were repetative, went on to long, and just became comical you can't take that much punishment and just walk away. The car fight in the Arc De Triomphe was different but again just stupid, no police, no one stopped everyone just carried on etc. It was like watching a arcade game with all weapons and you can't die. Then the warriors rip off near the end with the radio announcer? The first two John wicks were good, different, Halle Berry spoiled the third for me.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","info-72714","24 April 2023","After three previous films, in which the story, the action and the humor formed a unity, this farewell film feels superfluous.I will not fully describe the film, but after an 'Indiana Jones' (how this one is missed) opening, the film already collapses.There are hardly any humorous dialogues, but identical fighting scenes plague your eyes for 2.40 hours.It's impossible to keep watching seriously if all the characters just keep fighting after being fired at at close range several times.You have to dream along with a movie and not take everything seriously, but when the hero is constantly hit by cars and thrown down stairs countless times, it starts to look like a cartoon.Of course, I like Keanu and even look back at the earlier parts (particularly 1 and 2) with great pleasure, but this is expensive shoddy work. The fumbling with the nunchuks hurt my eyes: any 10-year-old child does this better.In short: Keanu played his imperturbable character properly, but simply fell victim to poor direction and a meager story.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","nigepitz","24 May 2023","JW4 has received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike but that's a mystery to me. JW1 introduced us to the world of the Continental, JW himself was tough but vulnerable and funny and the fight scenes were like nothing we'd seen before. It still had one foot in reality.But from JW2 onwards Mr Wick has become indestructible, an unkillable superhero with magical powers. Sure there were some good moments in 2 and 3 and some wonderful choreography but for me, everything that made the first instalment so amazing is missing from JW4. The humour has gone and many of the set piece fights look like they were shot during rehearsals when they were being practiced at half speed. You can see the stunt men waiting for their cue to attack. Worst of all though, it's boring. I had to turn it off and go back to it the next day. The bullet proof suits are ridiculous and reminded me of the missteps of the Bond franchise before the Craig reboot - (invisible car?) Keananunu is obviously older now and can't throw himself around like he could back in the day and maybe this is one of the problems. The biggest though is that when the protagonist is indestructible there is no jeopardy so therefore no interest.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","lonestaradvent","7 April 2023","I'm quite baffled at how good this movie was rated. I'm certain it is mostly the crew and their family/friends that upvoted this garbage.What was wrong with this film:Plot: the plot, like in most action films, is paper thin. Like most other reviewers have stated, you forget why he's doing what he's doing. This film had NOTHING to do with the first three, which is part of the reason of the success of the franchise. Nothing from the 3rd film was answered in this 4th rendition. What happend with Winston and Keanu from JW3? Why was nothing talked about. It's almost like writers retconned that whole scenario and it detracted from the movie. In the beginning of the film, JW kills the guy who heads the table. Kinda pointless, this should've been the climax of the film.The rest of the plot involved him going to random places to do random things, with action embodying the pacing throughout the film. His motivation was non-existent. If this was supposed to be the final film, why didn't Wick go after the bosses that have spots in the High Table? Why was he chasing after, or getting chased after by, the Marquis. The guy was a small fry compared to the High Table.The comedy was terrible as was the delivery. I was confounded in the theatre when people laughed at the ""dog bites nuts"" bit. We saw that JW3 with better taste.Acting/Characters: The acting is legit garbage. From Neo to Morpheus. It was over the top, and it looked like Neo learned his lines that day. Keanu's delivery was painful to witness. I was embarrassed I paid for the premium seating to watch this movie. Winston and Morpheus didn't care about this film and it showed. They would say a few lines then poof, disappear from the movie. This killed what little pacing the movie displayed outside of the action scenes.Although the film tried to make you care about the new comers, it failed miserably. There was no character development, just bits and pieces of information for the viewer to piece together to understand why they were placed in the film. The guy with the dog was a pointless addition. The antagonist was pointless as well.The blind warrior has been done to death, and JW4 defiled the grave. We don't care about him because he's a pointless addition to the movie to showcase ""eastern"" style fighting. He offers nothing to the plot. We don't care about his backstory, but we're forced to view it, because it's apparent he and that hot Japanese chick will be back in the 5th movie or the series.The Action: it was comical and sad. Keanu just can't do what he did 3 or 4 years ago and it shows with every fight scene he's in. If you actually paid attention to the moves that the other actors performed while fighting with Keanu, you can see where they wait for him to perform his set, and join the dance accordingly. It was painful to watch Keanu try to do the outlandish moves that he performed in the first 3 entries of this series. Every time he was in a fight scene, his sluggish movements just took me out of the movie and made me impatient.The Setting:
Part of the success of this franchise is how the setting was ever widening with each new movie. The first movie we got a glimpse of his time with the Russian Mafia. The second movie we see there is an intricate web of different crime bosses that have formed a collective of control on a world wide scale. The third movie furthered this notion of world wide control as John seeks the man above the table to redeem his life.The fourth movie did nothing to help evolve the setting. Sure we see a lot of nice prints of different locations, but what does that have to do with the overall arc of the franchise? Nothing. We're taken to different locations for arbitrary reasons and the director expects the audience to oh and ah over the cinematography.The Realism:
Going into an action film, I think we, as an audience, understand that reality is loosely based. This film took it to another level. The director and writers rip us out of the movie when John falls 4 stories and walks it off, gets hit by 5 cars going at least 30+ mph and gets up to dust off his coat, and falls down over 200+ STONE stairs and cracks his back to start his ascend in the final act.What Hollywood doesn't realize is that in order for this kind of fantasy to work, it has to be within a certain genre of film or literature. Just like I wouldn't want to see Harry Potter doing some Calc problems, because magical fantasy ya know? I expect John to be hurt at some point when surviving bone shattering and organ expoding injuries.Overall, this film sucked from start to finish. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either: Someone who worked on the film, a family/friend, a cringe fanboi, or someone who worships Keanu cuz he's a nice guy irl.","

I liked the first two offerings and even the third was OK but this video game of a movie tried to send off the protagonist with a bang but tried too hard. It ran way to long. Its like the producers solicited every action idea from anyone and put it in the film but at the cost of things like dialog and plot.The video game crowd will undoubtedly love this film and it does have some beautiful cinematography and effects. It was fun seeing Donnie Yen playing the anti-hero as well. But it all fell flat after a promising start. After a while I felt like I was watching my kid play video games and I hate watching my kid play video games.The movie made poor cinematic quotes of other movies. The DJ and Plymouth Cuda - Vanishing Point. The DJ and assassins - Warriors. There was a nod to the Matrix as well. You get the idea. But they were poorly conceived and some so vague that they added nothing to the film. At one point I'm pretty sure the movie started quoting itself.John Wick was a cartoon of his former self. The Marquis said it best when he said that the entire idea of John Wick must be eliminated as well as everything he touched. Well, congratulations movie. You've done just that. I hung in to see how it ended. It could have been great and a fitting end to a great franchise but instead we got a beautiful video game. Don't press reset. This one is dead. Enough Already.","

In their defense, they probably couldn't find enough positive remarks to say about the movie other that ""it's cool"". There's perhaps a few who have gotten enough vicarious thrills and can't wait to buy a semi-automatic rifle. Not the kind to have fathers at home willing to teach them how to handle guns and when to use them.The movie itself is a mindless non-interactive video of long fight scenes in which the characters fight after they should have been killed or disabled by nunchucks, swords or pistols. It is a continuous blood bath with a muddled plot and no humor. When our civilization is unearthed in a thousand years and if a copy of this movie is recovered, the historians could only conclude the we were destroyed from within and a strong contributing factor were mindless and violent entertainment like this.If you haven't yet seen it...don't.","

John Wick seems like a superhero and it's unrealistic as a movie can be.However, this was always the case, regarding this franchise. JOHN WICK franchise is not THE RAID, neither the first RAMBO. Stahelski is not Gareth Evans. These are action movies that don't take themselves too seriously. This was obvious from the start. Not action comedy movies of course. (There was always an offbeat comedy element though, remember the third movie, even Boban Marianovic was one of the bad guys). Just action movies who don't want to be realistic or convincing. Just fun and a bit of ""Style over Substance"".In this regard, JOHN WICK 4 is the most ""Johnwick-y"" of the entire franchise. Relentless killings and action and some of the greatest action scenes i have watched in years. The scenes in Italy were amazing with all those cars playing a vital role. This is a cinematographic achievement. I don't know how they pull it but even the CGI scenes seemed authentic to me.In conclusion, this is the definition of entertainment. Of course, these characters are not human beings anymore, they don't talk like real humans, they don't act like real humans. They are Symbols. Stereotypes. Shadows. Of course the night club scene -- in which people are dancing whereas other people are killing each other in front of them-- is not realistic. Nothing is real here. John Wick is not a real person but a metaphor. Like poking fun at his own character, playing it with a straight face though.I could watch another 3 hours.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","gradd-67422","3 June 2023","I m beginning to believe that all those high rated reviews are either planted or submitted by underaged people or uneducated boomers. Especially those who call this a potentially best action movie ever must certainly be off the reservation.The film is literally a longer copied version (2h49m) of the previous 3. Theres nothing new with the characters, no new exploration, no arcs, no development. Just more double crossing and more of the same action scenes that we ve seen in the previous 3 films. If John Wick killed 500 enemies in this film, 250 of them died in the classic MMA-->Reload pistol--->Shoot them in the head style. We ve seen this move being repeated again and again and again since the 1st installment and now they are shoving it into our faces for almost 3 hours.If we wanna talk basic, just basic, realism, well... then lets talk about the complete absence of any form of police force while there is a ground war happening under the Arc of Triumph, or the church stairs.John Wick is getting an armored suit upgrade every film. Tony Stark would be jealous and probably would steal the design for his ""learn from my mistakes"" theme. Wick falls off buildings, luckily theres just one car under the building and Wick happens to jump right at the spot where that one car is parked, but even then from that height, half of his body should have been broken. Guess his armored suit is from Vibranium and absorbs kinetic energy and all types of vibrations.Obviously his enemies are all baboons on easy mode who cant even shoot a target dummy at 2 meters, but given the state of bulletproof armors in the film, his enemies decide to use Dragon's Breath rounds so that Wick can loot them off their corpse like a Call of Duty protagonist to counter the amount of armored enemies he encounters.I honestly could write 20 more paragraphs with all the negative parts of this film, but i think i wrote enough. The only reason i m rating this as 3 and not 1, is because in the very little amount of time that Mr. Keanu Reeves got to actually act as John Wick, he managed to maintain his unique calm and chill persona throughout two and a half hours of fighting and shooting, pain and bleeding.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","michaelquinn1966","2 June 2023","I'll preface this review by stating I loved the first three John Wick films especially the first one and was very much looking forward to number four.The premise ""too much of a good thing, can be a bad thing"" very much applies to JW chapter 4. What a way to decimate a franchise. This latest instalment was three hours of the same fighting scenes redone time and time again only difference a new city, three hours of a nonsensical story that just made nonsense and was basically just recycling scenes from the first 3 films.An hour or so into this film I was ready to quit, it was just mind numbingly boring and ridiculousA Blind Assasin - who can't detect a person five feet in from of them but manages to defeat anyone who came his way
Halle Berry looking really rough and minus a dog, what was the point of this character
A $20 million open contract on John Wick, yet he moves around the world unhindered until they basically redo the first 15 mins of the third film but in Paris when all of a sudden they need yet more fighting scenes
A ridiculous and pointless omage to ""The 1979 Warriors movie"". Broadcasting over radio to French gangsters and Assasins in English.............. wtf üò¨I could go on and on with everything that was wrong with this film but let's get to the good points
.............................
There isn't a single one, this is just a terrible, terrible film and would have been a horrible way to end the franchise if news of a fifth film entering production and I can only imagine how bad that is going to be.So ignore all these high mark reviews as they are quite simply lying and watch this train wreck at your own peril.","

This movie was a bore.This review was made in the month of April the 14th in the year 2023. In century 21st.What was this movie about?: Honestly I can't remember what the last 3 were about. I know I enjoyed them.This one was about people being tortured by the dog.John Wick plays fugitive but with many gun battles.The story and the production overview: It was boring. The only deeming quality was the Asian Daredevil. Wick got whoop throughout the movie.The Kraven the hunter character was one of those mixed unsure characters. He behaves one way then the other.I hated his dog. Kraven the Hunter was a dognutter in this.The dog being unphased after slamming into a vehicle was hash.The pitbull at the end was unnecessary to have in the movie. The movie was more about dogs than having a good movie.Genre: Fightin/shooting/secret society
Soundtrack: mix it was fine.Duration: 2 long hour of enduring a worthless mutt.UnHighlight: the dog. Very cringe.Highlight: Asian DaredevilWhat can be learned?: well watching serious movie was a good change from the comedic MCU films.Seems like serious movies are on the edge of extinction.Verdict: I was bored and wanted to sleep.","

Then thrid was just a whole bunch of silly fight and shooting with people wearing bulletproof suits so they protect their faces with their jaket, they take bullet on the legs, arms etc. Keep fighting and shooting. But a knife can easily go through! What a joke.The Chapter 4 is really the dumbest of all. There is hardly any intelligent structure on that movie. Just fight with swords, guns, knives etc. And guess what? Same suits!I don't konw how many gunshots were fired during the making of this film.

The lazy rip off of the Warriors narrator style hunt, even copying it's 'boppers' epithet, was pathetic. It lacks the style and charm of Warriors.I tried to like this. I was a big fan of the John Wick series until 3 which started to run out of plot ideas but this is a stretch too far. The Marquis character is laughably lame, just a cliche rich boy with a trumped up ego (not to mention the poor French accent - just use a French actor!).This film should have been 1h30, they really had to work hard to get it to 2h40! I also really like Keanu but damn, his martial arts skills are like an arthritic pensioner.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","supergye","14 April 2023","As a cinephile and decades of watching action movies, one is not as tantalized by the mere act of killing and car chases. What Wick 4 attempts to do is bring the action to another level on top of the prior 3. Not an easy task given the relentless killing and video game level of endurance the main character has. It is akin to the experience of watching Fast and Furious. We know no one could survive the falls and gun fights, and that is part of the fun. The audience is in on the joke sort of speaking. Dialogue is used sparingly. The mystery of the High Table, the almost religious codex that is followed by the criminal organization gives the movies a greater meaning than perhaps the sum of its parts. Reeves is a perfect fit, and we cheer for him as he appears to be the best most conscientious of the worst the org has.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Anseldog","24 June 2023","Phew. I'm exhausted just thinking about this one.I very much enjoyed the previous three films, although admittedly by the third film the fights just didn't have that same impact and overall it was growing tedious, but I tuned in for this one cause my man Keanu deserves it.Sadly, the man gave it his all, but for the wrong movie. The first few films, the fight scenes felt fresh and new, if not quite reaching the levels of mastery displayed in the stupendous film THE RAID (which I feel this franchise owes a great deal of credit to) but by the fourth go around it all feels stale. And not to knock my man Keanu, but he looks tired. The acrobatics just didn't look fluid this time. Don't even get me started on the seemingly endless fight sequence in Japan. Wow - showed flashes of brilliance but when it lasts thirty minutes?? It was almost comical how interminable it felt.I'll give points for the continued showing of imagination fleshing out this world (although we all have to agree, the rules and lore are so confusing at this point that one can barely keep track of what's going on) as well as the wonderfully executed scene at the Arch de Triumph but the rest of this film just felt like a chore. And wow - could we have cut that video game baddie scene with the big fat card player? So lousy. Also - miscasting with the usually on point Skarsgard.Couldn't wait for it to be over, or for Keanu to put me out of my misery.","

Lot of fight with a boss to defeat each time and the final boss.Nothing new, nothing that we haven't already seen. Some fights are so incredibly lame (opponents seems to goof around just to wait for the hero to get ready rather than attack and kick his ass into orbit) that they just not make sense. Or maybe the director think we the audience are all a bunch of stupid children.The first John Wick made sense. It was about a man who kicked some asses and got kicked for good.This one is more like one of the hundreds dumb superheroes (please.... The suit that deflect the projectiles is so utterly ridicolous that not even the excuses ""it's made out of kevlar"" can stand on its feet) that already are clogging the theatres and the tv on demand.We don't really need another one that turn a good idea, a good character and a potentially good franchise in a pile of fuming, smelly manure.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","okpilak","12 July 2023","It delivers everything one would want in a John Wick film. A very high body count, and very impressively staged fight scenes, and seeing the punishment he takes, you have to think ""boy that must really hurt."" And as usual John Wick leaves nothing to chance, as he makes sure the attacker is dead. So it is a high octane movie, with some of the usual characters, and this time John is fighting to leave the Table for good. So the stakes are very high. There is some lull between the attacks, but not a lot of time is wasted even though it is a long film. As entertainment, it fills the bill. And it doesn't pull punches.","

The result was just as I expected. It was just the same as Bullet train and other movies produced from the same production. Just another typical villains and typical fight scenes over and over. This John Wick production team or ""franchise"" has transitioned into a new Fast and Furious franchise making the same movies again and again by replacing cars and gimmicks. If they pivot and make some turns to adapt new ingredients that we've tasted from the first John Wick movie, then it would be still enjoyable, but it's too late to stop this ""cliche train"" starting from John Wick chapter 3, Nobody, Bullet Train, Violent night, and this John Wick: Chapter 4. I don't think this franchise will die any time soon. They are probably working another movies in John Wick universe right now.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","elviss111","23 October 2023","I love the Wick franchise and its approach to action packed movies. However, JW4 attempts to turn up everything to 11 and therefore fails to capture what is so special about the Wick franachise.While there are many points to be made about what was terribly wrong in this film, I would like to highlight three aspects that struck me the most. Firstly, the storyline is atrocious and makes no sense. Second, the fighting scenes are among the worst of the franchise. And third, the silly stylistic choices make you wonder if a child was in charge of making this stuff up.What a way to destroy what was so well built up in the first three movies. In the third chapter of John Wick, they build up the expectation that John Wick and the Bowery King are ready to go to war with the High Table and tear them down from their ivory castle. However, in this chapter, all Wick is doing is fighting against the High Table to achieve his freedom, and while he achieves this goal in the end, it has no effect on the High Table what so ever. One could even argue that because Wick died in the end, the whole fight was pointless. After four movies, the conclusion was that John can die a free man and a few ""important"" persons are dead. That's it. All the killing and pain for no tangible outcome. The High Table rests nearly unscathed and resuming business as usual. It feels like the studio realised the potential of the Wick universe and decided to write a different story that was originally intended. In addition, there were many illogical aspects about the story that made no sence. For example, there was no explanation why John had to go to Tokio and have another continental deconsecrated. Also, while the concept of a Marquis who is given all the power of the High Table is interesting, it feels like a cop out, so that the writers don't have to think too hard and write compelling and intricate stories about how the Table operates or what it consists of. Instead, we get a single face that serves the purpose of the High Table for the movie, and yet, is not really the High Table. All in all the story has too many flaws to be forgiven and makes the viewing very dissatisfactory.As for the fighting scenes, I understand that production has the need to turn up everything to 11 and make everything look cool or superhuman. But all that does is make the viewer go ""oh come on"" multiple times per fight. All the intricacy and realism that we have learned to expect from John Wick before went straight out the window. The fight scenes seem similar to previous movies but are so far and beyond unbelievable that it feels just stupid and disrespectful.And lastly, the stylistic choices that were made seem to be aimed at the younger population. The blind expert fighter, the lonely gunman with a dog sidekick, the mid-movie bossfight with a fat boss. The overall style of the Wick universe is very unique and intriguing but the attempt to amplify its style results in silly outcomes that are more offputting than intresting.As a huge John Wick fan, I am sad that Wick's story had to end on a low note. While the logical conclusion to this story, that Wick passes away after all the fighting is befitting, it is sad that he doesn't really accomplish anything with it. Rest in peace Wick. Hopefully your legacy will live on.","

The action is a pale imitation of the previous movies.The plot is ridiculous...without going into particulars it's just so silly.And although Reeves says about 15 words in 3 hours, his acting is so bad, it's hard to hear those 15 words.I realize this is all from the comic.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","roxlerookie","26 May 2023","I watched a 3h headshot fest where john wick chooses to let himself die on the street after getting shot by a blind man .Several things bothered me. Mostly the script being appalling / cringe / bland.I'm French, yet the shootouts in Paris involve American muscle cars, random bad guys and lots of automatic guns. I would have liked to see something a bit more local / that'd ring more true.Why does JW need to fall from a 3-4 storey building, get hit / run over by 5 cars, and literally fall hundreds of stairs? It's Deadpool level of trauma, but he's meant to only be human. If he can withstand that, why does he die at the end from flesh wounds?Why pick Scott Adkins to actually act? I'm sure he's buddies with Chad (the director), but the guy can't act, and barely had fight scenes. It also made no sense his character would be such a good fighter.Why do we get such a lame, young villain? There are much, much better villains out there.Why have some of the action in Japan?I guess they wanted to film in Paris, so they made the villain French (I think?). Except he's Swedish, and just doesn't feel French at allDidn't we deserve anything fresh? We got a recycling of: Kevlar suits, black full body armors (but this time around they're not nearly as bulletproof?), swords, attack dogs, American muscle car scene, motorbike scene. I mean come on.And why is the man killing John blind? Did he need to be blind?Visually, it all looked very good. Nothing we haven't seen before, but very visually pretty, the lighting especially. The killing go so repetitive that they switched to full on video game mode with camera from above. It was kind of cool, but also very silly as it felt again like playing a video game on rookie mode.All in all, an extremely long movie despite zero character / story development, suffering from remarkably bad writing & casting. In a way I'm glad John died because I know i'd keep watching the sequels, like the F&F movies, and feeling dirty afterwards.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","danielcereto","27 May 2023","John Wick first movie was an authentic masterpiece. Action was pretty well executed, even credible, thanks to Mr Keanu Reeves work and an interesting script and great choreographies. So consequently, I was pretty excited about the 4th statement. Same director, Keanu, and one of my favorite martial arts actors: Mr Donnie Yen (If you don't know who is him I recommend to watch IP man movies), simply amazing.Anyway, what can go wrong with a great talented cast and a great director?... Almost everything.First, the action scenes are extremely long and unreal, even sometimes boring because the repetition of them. You know nobody can't kill John, from the beginning because of his new Marvel's anti bullet suit... Really?Second, the movie itself looks like a videogame or a superheroes movie. It has lost it's soul, any realistic or human scene. A shame. Watch the original again to know what I am talking about. To add, the script is inexistent. The most predictable one from the Saga.Last, it's great to include animals but sometimes it's embarrassing to watch several ultra unreal situations. I really love animals but stop making them superheroes, (watched Sisu too this week).So, overall, is it a bad movie? Not it's not. It's the just the John Weak's of the saga. Best again are the filmography, music and direction. Beautiful but empty.","

And it becomes more and more bloated, borderline idiotic with every new introduction... did 5-year old wrote this ??Even the action scenes - the whole selling point of these movies became stale and just boring. Establishing that magical bulletproof suits exist - created the situation that most of people became impervious to bullets which forces characters to spend just to much time on every baddie (and there's a lot of them). And worse of all ... half of them tries to cover their faces with their jackets, looking like Bela Lugosi in his campy Dracula movies, lurking from behind his cape... which is so unintentionally funny that it breaks all tension of situation. And it would be incredibly easy to fix - just invent magical armour piercing bullets and set back to more grounded action scenes from first entry :/To put it bluntly - this movie is so boring, and so stupid, that it actively wastes your time.

It started getting silly in 2 and 3 become overkill but this is something else...It's literally 3hrs of an unstoppable Wick just mowing through an endless amount of bad guys. It doesn't matter the weapon... swords, nunchucks, pencils, kung fu, ju-jit-su, cars, whatever. Wick is a master of absolutely everything. And no one can seem to kill him. They always attack him either one or two at a time, no one knows how to take a head shot and he's entirely bulletproof. The concept of the bulletproof suit was introduced in the 2nd one but it was explained how it was still painful and getting shot still seemed to have an effect. In this one, nothing. Just shoot someone with a rifle, shotgun, automatic fire, etc and they just hold up their suit coat with zero effect.With that being said, there absolutely is zero effect, Wick has god mode on. Nothing stops him. At all. High falls of two / three / four stories, nope. Jump out a window and slam into a car? Nope. Just gets up and walks away. Falls, bounces off a concrete ledge and slams on the ground? Nope, just gets up and continues on. Hit by multiple cars, no effect. Thrown down stairs, it's fine. What's the point of this movie if Wick can't die, at all.... There is no threat of the guy losing.Then with that being said even more... it's 3hrs. 3hrs of action scenes that drag on way too long with injuries you just start shaking your head at. 3hrs of complete nonsense. Honestly at the 45 minute mark, I was just shaking my head and annoyed there was over 2hrs left...I loved the first movie. But why they took this series in this direction is just mind blowing. It's honestly just as bad if not worse than the Fast and the Furious movies. And just like the F&TF movies, they just keep making them.

I was waiting with great enthusiasm as the previous 3 were very good in my opinion. This is a pure abomination of a movie which should have been good. I gave it 1 star for some of the choreography in the fight scenes. You can not fire so many rounds in close quarter combat and not hit the target. The action scenes are ridiculous as they are not believable. When making an action movie the makers must learn to make it believable .Rounds will not bounce off cars or glass,don't get the hero or heroine to take out too many people at once. This is boring but don't take my word for it,watch it and see for yourself. When watching movies we all look at that them on different levels .I like to be immersed in at so it has to be believable,others like lots of action that is no where near believable but they love to see lots of fight scenes and if you are one of them and like the lead to be some sort of superhuman,then it's for you.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","kosmasp","29 March 2023","No pun intended - and that feeling can be many things. While I still see Keanu from the Bill and Ted franchise .. the way he talks and how he ""acts"" ... well if you've seen it once, you can't unsee it. That said, it does not take away anything from the action extravaganza that is going on in this. Actually that makes me want to revisit the other Wick movies and maybe re-rate them. Giving them a higher score.Also I have to admit, that even though Denzel is the better actor (no secret here), franchise wise Wick has totally obliterated the Equalizer franchise ... kind of like he obliterates his enemies as Wick. You may wonder why they even try .. I guess for our amusement. For those who are able to stomache all the violence that is of course.I did watch this on an Imax screen and let me tell you: violence never looked better. But also everything else. Be it dawn, sunrise and everything in between. There are many scenes and there are some quotes that should be inspirational too. Friendship means little when it's convenient ... that is some deep ... stuff right there.I don't think that the movie gives the viewer too many riddles when it comes to guessing where it all leads to. You also should not mind the fact that Keanu or rather Wick must have a bionic body ... or his suit actually is made of a material that shields his body ... well one or the other ... or you just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. It makes as much sense as driving cars into space (yes looking at you Fast and Furious franchise) ... but we do not watch these movies for logic and rhyme and reason. I'd hope the same applies to you.There are some really great visual stunts in Paris - and it looks like they shot them there. But CGI is so far ahead ... who really knows? It does look awesome though. And towards the end ... the action inside a house and the way it is shot ... the director is coming up with new stuff all the time.And for the first time ever (in a John Wick movie), there is an after credit scene ... so sit down and wait for it - even if it may not be entirely satisfactory ... then again, until the next one comes out (it surely must be announced soon, no matter how this ended), the ending here is also ... well you may not be entirely happy with it ... but happy is a word that is missing in Wicks dictionary anyway ... so there we go.Edit: I don't do pointers when I write reviews which leads to me forgetting stuff. Lance Reddick who recently passed away and will be missed, was obviously an integral part of the franchise. Many may know him from TV shows, such as Fringe, The Wire and many more. But apart from him and many recurring characters (those who survive that is), we get many Newcomers. Bill Skarsgard being the top villain - and he does a great accent! As does Scott Adkins - ja! And of course the excellent as always Donnie Yen! The action (choreography) is the star - but it doesn't hurt to have some great people in front of the camera too.","

Where to even start with this one. The story is repetitious. The characters are over played and predictable.There's nothing remotely realistic about this movie.I cannot fathom how anyone has given this a positive rating let alone 10/10 and calling it the best action movie ever.It's basically a child's video game where the character you play never dies no matter how many times they get shot, hit by a car, in a fight, fall down stairs etc.So so bad.","

Reminded me of all the bollywood films I've watched where they never die even when they're shot and after being stabbed repeatedly. This film could have been made in 1.5 hours or so where I would have enjoyed it more. Thank god I didn't pay to go to a cinema. Kept waiting for dual but of course had to kill a 101 people before it happened. Please don't make any more John wick films they are getting boring and no excitement. Overall the film from start to finish was a waste of my time, probably enjoyed 1/2 hour or so.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","J0ESUFF","19 October 2023","As my title suggest this movie is WAY TOO LONG. There is just too much time filler and the action, although impressive, has gotten fatigued. The first one made sense, the second one I understood and the third one provided a nice opportunity to wrap the STORY but they didn't, instead it was more just a non stop choreography dance. The scene that really made start zoning out was when he's in a shootout with about 100 men in a club while people continue dancing around them completely unaffected by what's happening. Multiple times you can see a bad guy wait for John Wick to look at him before attacking, it's just getting old.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","olhpickering","30 May 2023","Spoiler alert.It's John Wick. You know what your in for and it looks good, and the action is good in places. But, long story short, there is no point in any of the events in this film happening. It also pretty much renders 2 and 3 null and void.Everything he did, going against the high table, trying to get out, is undone because he just dies. If he'd got killed at the start nothing would have been any different. He manages to get out from under the High table but just dies so why bother? Okay, you can listen to Reeves and the director waffle on about this and that but who cares?""For him to get his peace, or freedom, in a way... that was the reason to make the movie. It can't just be, 'Let's do another one'. It was really about death, or a way of dying. We were really inspired by the Hagakure.""Great, cheers Keanu.Another theme seems to be consequences and facing them... okay fine, other characters do keep pointing out that he's getting everyone killed with HIS actions and he is. But y'know, surely he'll redeem himself and achieve something. Nope.You could also argue that he sacrifices himself to save his friend and his daughter but again who cares about that? The daughter is in it for about 20 seconds (and is less of a character then John's car was in the first film) but nevertheless he helped them and that's a positive. Oh wait, the post credits scene it's going to make sure even that small spark of hope gets snuffed out.It's a mean spirited and cynical film, that relies far too much on magic kevlar suits to mask the paucity of new ideas (although the ""dragon breath"" scene is cool) and just leaves a sour taste, even though it didn't have to. There are so many narratively satisfying ways to kill off a main character but this managed to miss every single one of them.The first one is brilliant. Lightning in a bottle. Turning it into a franchise bloated it and then killed it stone dead.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","PotassiumMan","10 April 2023","Intensely engaging, immensely satisfying and courageously anguished, this John Wick chapter delivers the goods and then some. It's a testament to the durable potency of a well-executed, non-formulaic action film. There's so much raw vitality here, that one will barely notice the running time.Keanu Reeves never loses his power or presence as the former hitman who once again faces an imposing army of antagonists and pursuers even as he plots his own course of payback. Although some action sequences can be a little protracted, in the end, they achieve lasting and memorable power on account of this director's knack for innovative camerawork.This time around, John Wick's globetrotting work puts him in the crosshairs of the Marquis Vincent de Gramont, a cold-blooded member of the High Table. Their rivalry becomes a fierce battle that is waged at first in Osaka then Berlin and then throughout the streets of Paris. It's an opulent, labyrinthine showdown that we don't get to see very often in action films. Lush, colorful settings adorn the violence and bloodshed, almost as if to have to the physical beauty bely the depravity and carnage taking place.Recommended to everyone, regardless of their preference or penchant for the action genre. Many modern action films are solely for action fans. This proves to be the exception.","

Just hours of mumbled dialogue, dark interior sets and non-stop Ninja fighting. The fights went on for hours and they did not make sense as humans didn't seem to be killed by bullets or knives and there was no reasonable explanation for it---the bad guys were not all robots. The plot was murky and we already know that Keanu Reeves is a robotic, deadpan actor. I have no clue as to how this film got rated 7.9. Unless kids and teens, under 35 people love to watch gratuitous, meaningless, poorly acted violence.","

They're rendered meaningless and ineffectual just by how long they go on and how high the body count is. Less would have been more for this movie.The scene where he gets kicked down the stairs and just keeps flinging himself down all of them even though he could easily stop himself might just be one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a movie.The scenes with the ""blind"" guy who fights like he can obviously see is probably THE stupidest thing I've ever seen. It's really kind of a shame what this franchise devolved into. It's even less believable than superhero movies at this point. Even more of a shame is that the general public seems to be so mindless that this kind of drivel actually finds success. I'd be embarrassed to tell anyone that I actually enjoyed this.","

Then the second and third films were pretty much repeats, but with each iteration the action becomes more dull, more tedious.This is more of the same; like a video game from the 1990s with each part of the film leading to a bigger 'boss' to defeat. But with none of the fun of a video game because you aren't playing, you're watching. And the outcome is pretty much obvious from the outset.The action scenes that were the highlight of the first film, have become the bits to fast forward as they are so repetitive. The only interest is how the story progresses. And that is a fatal mistake as the story is thin at best.Please just stop now.","

They keep figuring out ways to keep the story interesting, delivering on the action set pieces and adding to the lore in a very effective and stylish way. John Wick 4 was an absolute pleasure to watch. It was full of entertainment. Despite being almost 3 hours long, it does not have boring sections. The non-action scenes have interesting characters, drama and incredible production design. John Wick continues to raise its own bar. As in the previous entries, each action set piece is distinguished and powerful. This is one of those movies that must be watched on the big screen.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Top_Dawg_Critic","24 March 2023","Still one of the best action films of the best action film franchise, but I can only give this one a 9/10 when the first three films all got 10/10's. The main reason is that for this one being the longest of them all, the plot had more holes and the random new characters lacked the background they needed.Throwing in Mr. Nobody was just dumb, as was his story. It was just too random and lazy, especially with all that extra runtime. Having all the opportunities to collect the bounty was just too easy and took away from all other more deserving assassins to collect, and more importantly, his reasons for not cashing in were just too unbelievable and ridiculous. Instead of introducing him as a new character, they should've capitalized more on Fishburne's character and involved him more in this film, instead of him being a delivery boy - that was just a huge let-down.And as much as I love all the action scenes - and they were the best and longest thus far, they just didn't feel as authentic as the action in all the precious films. In the three-hour runtime, there's maybe a 15-20 min story, the rest is overboard non-stop action that is mostly ridiculous - yes, still the best I've ever seen, and it will probably be a long time before that's topped, if ever, but so much of it with so little story, unbalanced the overall viewing experience. The current narrative barely constituted a two-hour film, let alone three hours. Nevertheless, still an amazing film, it's the writing that could've been better and more in abundance.","

Then you have the usual Hollywood 100lb supermodel who can beat up musclebound henchmen like nothing. The fighting is just so over the top, it's ridiculous. John Wick never gets hurt even when he is being shot at point blank range!!! The leader of the whole Table lives out in the middle of the Sahara Desert???? I mean the plot is just so dumb and contrived. Plus, as much as I love Keanu, I think he has definitely grown too old for this type of role. It is basically a 6.5 film that I bumped up to 7.

However, under the leadership of the arrogant and sadistic Marquis (Bill Skarsgard) a contract for $20M remains in place and the Marquis starts by seeking revenge on Winston for not killing Wick in JW3.There are simply no other films like the JW films. Basically Wick moves from one impossible scenario to another beating up and killing what must be 100+ baddies in this film. The trick with all this is the stunning, balletic way these scenes are put together - they are just so incredibly and beautifully designed and almost hypnotic to watch - there is scene where you watch Wick move from room to room burning people up or shooting them and filmed from above - extraordinary. Wick is just the coolest character on screen since Frank Bullitt and he is well supported by Ian McShane, Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen and Skarsgard is a terrific bad guy.Whether there will be a 5th film remains to be seen - would be nice, the planet lives in hope.","

It has no meaningful dealogues. The dealogues are like 2 weak minded people having a conversation. Just pointless. There are so many shootings and fights in the film that it's just boring to watch. You can't keep your attention on the endless gunfights and fight scenes. There are so many illogical places in the film that you start to get angry at the film. John is like some kind of superman. Maybe this is a Marvel movie? And I thought, on principle, if I watched this film not in the cinema but on home video.

Frantic grabbing for guns and other fighters, couldn't hit a cow's backside with a banjo, despite having automatic weapons. Wick sometimes is dead-eye, sometimes can't get his bullets to hit a target 3 feet in front of him.Most of his wooden opponents are just trying to get punched or drop their guns. None of them can swing a punch, even when practically invited.Oh and not even fancy Kevlar armoured suits would protect from the car crashes and falls from heights.And why kill someone with one head-shot when three will do?Frankly, the whole thing was ridiculous and Al the bs about the 'old rules' for the final duel!?!

While every film in this franchise has been absolutely great, John Wick: Chapter 4 has changed the action genre in films as we know it, bringing everything it could possibly give us to the franchise and more. This movie had action and stunts that I never thought could be possible until viewing this movie and it did not disappoint. After taking a hard hit and recovering from the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum, Keanu Reeves returns once again as John Wick to take down any assassin that comes his way and put a end to the manhunt against him by challenging a lead member of the high table to a duel that will either earn him his freedom or could be the end of the Boogeyman. The antagonist in this film Marquis de Gramont played by Bill Skarsgard is absolutely menacing in this role, while bringing us not only a antagonist the franchise hasn't seen before, but also unlike any character Bill Skarsgard has played before. Out of all the newest cast members to come to this film, Donnie Yen was a absolute standout as Caine, a blind assassin and old acquaintance of John Wick's whose ordered by Marquis to hunt him down or suffer the consequences. Shimazu played by Hiroyuki Sanada I also thought was a great addition to the cast after seeing his performance in Bullet Train. The character I was not expecting to like that I thought was also a highlight of the film was Tracker played by Shamier Anderson. He was probably one of my favorite characters to come to the franchise and I hope we see him again in the John Wick Universe in the future. I was glad to see Lawrence Fishburne's Bowery King return as well as Ian McShane's Winston. I was also very happy to see Lance Reddick return one last time as Charon after his sudden passing right before the release of the film. He may of not have had a lot of screentime, but the last scene he was in I felt was closure for not only Lance Reddick, but his character as well. There is no doubt in my mind that this film will go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time. John Wick: Chapter 4 is hands down one of the most action packed I've ever seen, while also being one of the best I've seen in a long time that was made carefully with the end result being one of the best action film to be released in the past decade.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","mesaxi","12 June 2023","If you like a bunch of dudes posing and fighting in the most inefficient manner because it looks cool on screen, this is your kind of movie.I'll admit, I'm not a fan of this type of movie. When the high tension music kicks in and people start shooting just close your eyes until it stops, you think John Wick will be dead? The plot is the same as in the other movies: Super badass is so cool everyone wants him dead including the ridiculous organization of metrosexuals and suicide girls that he works for.There were several attempts at humor that didn't land, it was ironically when the movie was deadly serious that I found myself laughing out loud.","

I have never walked out a a cinema mid film before, and I love the cinema, so that should be a warning to anyone even considering watching this file - JUST DON'T. "" To the extent that Wick's vehicles follow the same schematic as musicals, with shootouts taking the place of song-and-dance numbers, the script doesn't have to do much more than usher the characters from one showstopper to the next.""

"John Wick: Chapter 4","robertellis-98724","29 April 2023","I go into a movie like this not expecting amazing writing, dialogue, etc but for the cinematography and action scenes.John Wick Chapter 4 has some of the best shot action sequences I have ever seen on film. It also has some of the worst I've ever seen. There is a legitimate 40 minute action sequence near the opening of the film that had me begging for something else to happen. Then just as John is leaving, more goons show up and the fight just starts all over again...I have very mixed feelings about this film as the effort and style oozes off the screen from beginning to end. Some of the performances were even really good between the action scenes. The cinematography can be incredible! The opening sequence and shots of the sunset are beautiful. But it all means nothing if there is no substance behind it.The film's length is another serious problem. It is unjustifiable. I've seen these movies compared to games in the past, and as an avid gamer, I've never understood the criticism until now.Everything about this movie is a video game in all the worst ways possible: Stretching out content by putting meaningless side content that could easily be cut for a more meaningful story, just added to include more repetitive gameplay sections. Bullet spongey enemies that always miss their shots and fall with little to no thought. A main character that could survive a nuclear explosion if he covers his head with his suit jacket??? Falling from 50 foot drops that instantly kill characters that are not the main character. Hell, the last movie at least made it seem like the fall damage he sustained at the end required him to rest and recover...I know this is meant to be a ridiculous fun rolllercoaster ride, but once you do one loop de loop having another 20 on same ride with no break in between does not sound like fun to me.The pacing of the action scenes in this film somehow manage to make the idea of a blind man with a sword in his cane, being able to snipe people using motion tracking doorbells incredibly boring.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","tomasmcnicholas-61237","4 February 2024","Huge Keanu fan. Liked the first John wick movie. Second and third? Ok. Fine. But this one was absolutely silly at times. Wick literally ran around in a Bullet proof Dracula suit. He looked almost as ridiculous as those cloned scrubs all running around with super short khaki pant legs (or were they tucked into super high boots?). Who really cares. They looked like clowns. John wick is apparently the human rubber man because he got thrown off a 15 foot balcony and face planted the concrete, jumped face first out of a two story building then slammed into a car below, got hit by no less then 10 cars, maybe a hundred fists and kicks, got shot at by 200 supposed highly trained assassins who apparently couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, then gets thrown down maybe 10 flights of a concrete staircase. All these things would have killed an effin navy seal yet John wick stands right back up, walks away and keeps on kicking AS_es! I literally laughed throughout this movie on how absurd it all was. Fight scenes were brutally bad. Like really bad slow motion. Bad guys were hanging back to give John wick time to catch his breath. I can't remember one scene where he was attacked simultaneously by more than one guy at the same time. The guy with the dog had his left hand literally cut in two yet it was just wrapped by a crappy bandage while using it defend himself with out even a whimper from him. Finally, they killed off John wick with a few bullets that literally just grazed him. Whoever wrote this garbage needs to be outed as a scrub and a hack.","

I love John Wick 1-3 and saw all three of them 2-3 times in theatres, with more repeat viewings at home.John Wick 4 is an awful mockery of everything that made the franchise good. It is far too long and overindulgent - some filler shots go on for 20-30 seconds when they could have been 5 - and the movie lacks the kinetic realism of all the previous entries. The acting is bad, the dialogue is bad and even unnecessary at times, and plot is completely nonsensical.WHY does he drive in circles around the Arc de Triomphe when he could just drive Montmarte? He later drives the motorcycle there...How is the Eiffel Tower the closest the Bowery King can get him to Montmarte? That's where he was right before that!!Ugh, and don't get me started on the Marquis nonsense. It's the worst kind of one-up-manship - illogical, unfounded, and a pure plot contrivance.Hard pass.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","dizzymediainc","10 July 2023","It's pretty sad that this series went down the drain, the first 2 movies were really good but after that John Wick has started to decline with quality.Overall Chapter 4 is a huge disappointment, most of the movie revolves around characters we don't know and don't care about, the ones we do know barely have any screen time and dialogue, making me wonder why they even bothered showing them.From the first half hour i knew this wasn't going to be a good movie but i had hope it would get better, well by the end of the movie i was kicking myself for wasting 3 hours watching it.Sure there were a few cool moments and interesting plot points but few and far among the entirety of the film.Wicks dialogue was dull, short and pretty much pointless, he said almost nothing and when he did speak, it meant very little.The ending was extremely bad, all that struggle to what.. die on some stairs? Ridiculous.Don't waste our time with poorly made additions to an awesome series, spend the time and actually make good follow ups, not these quick turn out, let's cash in on the popularity follow ups that none of us Wick fans asked for.How people can even think this is ""one of the best action movies ever"" is beyond comprehension, you must not have watched actual good action movies haha thinking this pile of poop is actually good, oh brother.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","wargamesjoshua","28 March 2023","The entire plot of this movie was utterly meaningless. John Wick accomplishes absolutely nothing aside from getting all of his friends killed in his efforts to get away from the High Table, and all that sacrifice was meaningless in the end. From the way that the characters kept claiming that you can't change your nature, and how nothing meaningful changed in the end, I can only conclude that the pointlessness was the point.Should we try to better ourselves? No, says this movie. Should we try to better the world? No, you can't do that claims this movie.People, this movie claims, are nothing more than idiotic sheep that will just keep doing what they are doing, even as people are being brutally murdered right before their eyes. I remembered enjoying the first movie, but giving money to this disgusting piece of propaganda was a mistake.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","tommy-97761","6 May 2023","Sadly (for me) this is the first John Wick movie I've seen in the cinema. Had I gone to every each part, I might have understood the hype concerning the sequels sooner. This is surely an unpopular opinion, but the first movie allways felt pretty complete and satisfying as it was, with a clear goal, villain, action and worldbuilding. Though the sequels are full of awesome setpieces, modern action and more worldbuilding, it allways felt overly complicated. Well the fourth one made me understand. I still like the first movie the most, the experience of seeing this in the cinema just left me in glee for the entire runtime. I recognised action actors, stuntmen. The cinematography even during slow conversations is beautiful. The lighting, sets, music so stylistic. The action performed in choreographed long takes. Sometimes ridiculously long takes. The whole John Wick series is a loveletter to all stuntmen and action fans. An action movie done right, and the small screen does not do this series justice. You need to see those setpieces on a big screen and hear each bullet trough a propper sound system. Real locations, practical stunts, precise camera work, what more could you ask for? Of you still have a chamce to see this on the big screen, go and do it.","

I would say that it didn't have to be that long and there definitely could have been some small cuts at least.John Wick is all about the action and I like how they don't try to bs things too much like other action movies. The action scenes were one of a kind. Long and intense choreography over intesely fun music, mixed with the challenge of weapon/ride swapping, and even topped off with creative cinematography. The top down scene is the pinnacle of that. It was both intense and fun and something i've never seen before in an action movie. I couldnt help to smile at how mind blown I was for watching it.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","samirvolt","10 June 2023","This is the worst and last John Wick movie, and I can honestly say I am not biased. I liked the other three; even though they became progressively more unrealistic, and ridiculous. But this is definitely the worst film by far.Donnie Yen's acting is terrible. His lines and mannerisms are janky, and spastic. He's meant to come off as a funny blind character, but does not pull it off. He's no Blind Fury, or Zatoichi, and his fighting in the movie is not graceful but stilted and awkward.The movie itself is a boring slog. The entire film is one big death scene/fair well to John Wick's character, but it fails to pull off a satisfying ending and send off. John Wick dies from a gunshot to his lower left abdomen. This unkillable, magnificent bastard, the 'baba yaga' dies from a gunshot that probably just hit a kidney. Let me stress this; he does not get shot in the heart, or anywhere vital, he just expires at the end because the film needed him to.John Wick's unexpected surprise death aside, this movies action scenes are terribly boring. There is barely any violent humour except a dog biting peoples balls, which gets old fast. There's nothing new here; no new interesting ways in which Wick dispatches enemies. The other films at least had him kill someone with a book or something. Here Wick just falls from high places as usual, then gets hit by cars, as per usual, then gets up and walks it off, again; as usual.The film is chalked full of crappy fortune cookie statements and pseudo philosophical lines. And boy do they suck. Maybe Hollywood does need to pay these writers something, they don't seem to care anymore.None of the plot points are very interesting because its obvious stuff; for example there's no beating the table's top council, they just get replaced. And so the film tries (halfheartedly) to come up with a neat little solution; a duel between Wick and some French douche. A contrived dues ex duel with no real payoff. Wick dies for some new character and his daughter we don't even know. But don't worry, she plays a violin for 3 seconds, so we feel so much empathy for her...And Donnie Yen slurps up noodles in the shadows of a restaurant before we even see him do anything; so that's...relatable...I'm very disappointed in this movie; I really believe John Wick's character deserved better.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Rob-O-Cop","29 July 2023","I struggled to get through this movie. It took multiple tries over a few days. It was that tedious.The action scenes were initially impressively set up, but they dragged on for what seemed like forever, with no real point. Like watching over the shoulder of some 50 year old at an arcade game as he played a combat machine with updated graphics. Fun for him but considerably less fun for the people watching and not playing. Did I mention how much it dragged on? Almost 3 hours.... I was long and didn't have the content to keep it going.I do give credit for the myth and mystique of the world building, the layers of power, the tradition and honor amongst thieves and criminals, and I do like Keanu Reeves, and Ian McShane and some of the other actors a lot but you're left with the burning question - Why?Why are we subjecting ourselves to almost 3 hours of Reeves slaughtering people like he works in an an abattoir for humans.It was a show reel for the stunt and effects team, with impressive visuals and scenery but that doesn't make a good movie, that doesn't equate to entertainment, that doesn't justify wasting our time, and someone's money and resources.In a way it's a bullet to the head for the industry that makes this stuff, and let's face it much of Hollywood's output is based on this format. Senseless violence an brutality as entertainment. The weird thing is that this movie found the edge of people's tolerance for it through boredom. They made it boring so we now question why are we watching this stuff? Why are they wasting theirs and our time.","

John wants to clear his name and be done with the table but the route of getting there this time is much harder a task than we have seen before.There are so many highlights of the movie, the action was all superb ! I already after first watch have a favourite which is hard to pick as there are some AMAZING sequences in the movie. I won't say the location because I want to give nothing away but I will say in Paris with a lot of traffic !This movie delves into the characters way more than before, we get really good time with the side characters, usually a movie like this would give them 10-15 minutes screen time and kill them while this isn't the case, in the time sense. We get motive, we get their struggle and really good interactions with John. My favourite side characters were Nobody, Shimazu, and Caine.John takes some hits, serious fall damage but these are the movies not real life hahaha. It's a spectacle on a grand scale.Very small nitpicks, the fights are all superb but I would like some more intimate fights for eg JW1, when they entered his house it felt more threatening, and that's it hahaha it's personal preference as a nitpick which is pretty darn good.JW4 is definitely the best of the sequels and up there with the first in my opinion! 9/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","AvionPrince16","22 March 2023","I saw so many action movies even all the previous John Wick movies and i need to say that this movie put the standard pretty high. The sequences, the shots without a cut, the long sequences of fights was spectacular and really brutal. I enjoyed also the music during the fights and really put a nice rythm to the fights and give dynamics and nervosity. Also the set design from Osaka to Paris was gorgeous and had so many small details that i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen. We had also the story who introduced the new vilain who supposed to be French and was pretty convincing. We have also some interesting discoveries all along during the movie (the blind man who have his daughter in hostage, the way to put an end to all this and to recover the status of the guy in charge of the continental who get destroyed in the movie. The fights feel great even if we know that match a certain choregraphy and dont reflect a real fight but it was well made and have some interesting shots (when at the end they all tried to kill Wick in the building and the camera shot from above all the scene and transform it like a mini map). Some scenes really look gorgeous and awesome and like i said i saw so many action movies but this one was really different; even in the work of the lights and how they put the lights to create a certain tone. It was pretty effective and sometimes some scenes was pretty funny (with the dog). The end is pretty sad and thought that John Wick will made it trough all that but he died. The Caine Character have an interesting style: the way he fights, but i think it was not necessary to make him blind because some scenes lack of logic sometimes and questions us to the believable situations that dont feel believable sometimes(the fights, the fact that nobody had the idea to shot him in the head quickly)but it was ok and give a new opponent/friend to John Wick in this episode. Give it a try. The actions scenes (because its mostly an action movie)was pretty awesome (Arc de Triomphe, Osaka, sacr√© coeur). And make it memorable and its one of my favorite John Wick and maybe favorite action movies for now? But it was awesome really. And even some dialogues was well written and some meaningful moments. The story was good for an avtion movie but its certainly not the most interesting part in the movie for sure even if it have some interesting moments and revelations and surprises( i didnt expect the death of the concierge so quickly in the movie to be honest). A nice action movie. No doubt about it.","

Unfortunately they set the bar too high and with every movie things have gotten worse. I am deeply sorry to watch this movie to get Marvelised. A frickin blind dude who just happens to see everything? The staircase scene? Are you kidding me? Yeah yeah we are about to kill each other but first let me save your dog from the bad guys? Lets just make the dog pee over the bad dudes corpse with cheesey one liner? It had some great scenes but at this point this isnt a John Wick movie. It is like a bad parody of it from Marvel.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","FortySecondStreetFreak","23 March 2023","At least this once fine franchise now has a (meh) ending. Tired, stupid, annoying. Only 1 great gunfight (a GLORIOUS top down, exploding shotgun shells, massacre) & 1 good hand-to-hand fight (with an unrecognisable #ScottAdkins), the rest of the action's dull, repetitive, silliness. #KeanuReeves (effective in the other 3 films) here gives a truly appalling performance. He sounds like his batteries are running out, every....word....is....emotionless. His opening scene might THE worst acting seen in cinema history...& he only says ""Yeah""!.
Where once Wick dodged damage by using his skills to not get hit (& we could genuinely see how he avoided it), now he just brushes off 'Superman' level damage (it's so ridiculous it gets genuinely annoying...from plummeting off buildings, to getting hit by multiple speeding cars, to smashing down 100's of stone steps) that makes EVERY fight pointless (who cares if he gets punched, when bone crushing falls literally do no damage)? Assassins suddenly either don't bother to shoot or punch him when they have a chance, or simply can't hit him even if when he's standing still! But who cares anyway right, when he's now seemingly made of Adamantium!?.
And why tediously rehash ""Rogue One"" by making #DonnieYen blind again? Worse, it just adds to the annoying stupidity. That a blind swordsman could hear his enemy move, or feel the air moving when a sword strikes, makes (a fantastical) sense. But how does a blind man dodge getting shot by multiple gunmen standing 20-30 feet away? Can he 'hear' the direction a gun is pointing? What utter nonsense. In fact he's so not effected by being blind...why make him blind?!.
There's also a sorry lack of links to the other 3 films. You could watch this & fully understand most of it. Bar Fishburne, Reddick & McShane no characters return & even the shocking betrayal by #IanMcShane in ""3"" (including shooting Wick off a building) is completely ignored by the plot AND Wick! He's just back to being a friend & ally again as if nothing happened. Hell, even the damn dog gets ignored!.
The fact is if ""3"" had a better final 3rd with a satisfying ending we would've had a truly great action franchise trilogy. As it is the entire bloated finale & garbage non-ending of ""3"" seemed to doom the franchise UNLESS a (money-grabbing) ""4"" could perform a miracle...But as we know, miracles rarely happen.Best just stick with ""1"" then now.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","danielrichardgibbons","28 June 2023","I really like John wick 1. Other than the final fight it's such a great movie. I've seen it 5 times. I will never watch the other ones again. And if a John wick 5 comes out I will watch John wick 1 instead. The whole plot is so simple. You killed the wrong man's dog. I loved it. You know what I also loved. Matrix one. And with both franchises the plots get so complicated and it ruins the the sequels.John wick 4 was a chore for me to finish. There was zero tension built up if one of the million bullets fired at him would hit. If one of the million knives would stab. And there are 1 million assassins waiting around every corner with zero chance but every one of them is 100 percent confident. Just once I want to see one assassins do the math and be like my chances are not good.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","warren-87235","5 June 2023","The first John Wick was good fun. It's over-the-top, but enjoyable nonetheless. After the villains kill his puppy, being the last gift from his dying wife, we were provided with a great alternative to the usual motivation you get in such films.After that, JWII and JWIII became increasingly ridiculous. Even for films like this, there's a point at which 'absurd but fun' turns into 'so absurd it's no longer fun'.JW:IV is akin to watching someone else play a video game of the same repetitive thing, but also on 'god' mode with infinite stats, so you don't even have the fun of seeing the gamer's skill at play. It even looks and feels like a video game. The character is never injured beyond an 'ooh, I look tired' level, despite incidents that would have broken every bone in even a super-hero's body. You can shrug off one or two silly moments like that, but after the tenth or twentieth or thirtieth...The fight scenes are so long, so repetitive and have so little motivation, that you cease to care what's happening and genuinely feel like hitting fast forward. It's a bad sign when you want to fast forward through an action movie to get to the more interesting non-action moments.Ultimately, given that the character has had increasingly less and less motivation as each movie has progressed, we get to a point where the 'dramatic' conclusion leaves you cold. John Wick's motivation by this point is absolutely NOTHING, bar survival, so his 'sacrifice' ends up leaving you feeling that it was all pointless, especially considering the somewhat lacklustre villain. (Although I'm sure John will turn out to have survived for the next film anyway)A more interesting angle would have been teaming up with all his former allies to finally take down the 'high table'. Instead, we're treated to a shoulder-shrugging conclusion that was supposed to be dramatic and emotional but leaves you just not caring.It took two sittings to bother completing, but I'll give it a 5/10, because some of it is still well filmed and visually interesting, though mostly in the first hour.The films drop approximately a mark each time...JW:I - 8/10
JW:II - 7/10
JW:III - 6/10
JW:IV - 5/10 (being very generous)","

I mean come on a blind man knowing when john wick looks at him and how to fight everyone??? Be so serious right now. The dialogue was drawn out and overstayed it's welcome. Fight scenes were TOO choreographed so they were very obviously fake. Every line Keanu had, he sounded like he was asking a question. It's the same story line as john wick 2&3. Too long. Too boring. Too played out. Don't recommend. I created an IMDB account just to leave this review that's how bad it was.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Oh_Capital","3 April 2023","This is a classic case of style over substance. The settings and cinematography were pleasing to the eye, and the fight scenes were choreographed better than 90% of the other action flicks out there. The problem is I never cared about what was going on, who was dying, and how it was all gonna turn out for Baba Yaga.John definitely killed more men then words he said. It was mostly grunts and a couple of classic Keanu lines like ""I have to get back,"" monotone half sentences. But I suppose that is part of his charm. The point is the dialogue was terrible.I understand it's not an emotional drama so dialogue and plot are not at the top of the list, but could we not have gotten some decent story telling? It's just fight scene to fight scene. Oh well, John Wick is a fun time at the theater with your buddies and a couple of drinks, but be prepared to endure 3 hours of one big fight scene.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","ryanpethrow","19 March 2023","John Wick 4 picks up where the previous film left off, and it does not disappoint. Keanu Reeves returns to the titular character, John Wick, and once again delivers a breathtaking performance that is sure to leave fans in awe. However, this time around, Reeves is not the only one stealing the show. Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, and Lance Reddick join the cast, and their performances are nothing short of outstanding.Yen, a martial arts legend, brings his incredible skills to the movie and delivers some of the most brutal and cool action scenes in the film. Skarsg√•rd plays a new villain who is as menacing as he is unpredictable, and his scenes with Reeves are intense and thrilling. Reddick, who has been a fan favorite since the first movie, continues to shine as the enigmatic hotel manager, and his interactions with John Wick are as entertaining as ever.The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has been with the franchise since its inception, and he continues to showcase his expertise in creating thrilling and visually stunning action sequences.But it's not just the acting that makes John Wick 4 a standout action movie. The work of the stuntmen is absolutely incredible. The fight scenes are brutal and fast-paced, and the choreography is flawless. Every punch, kick, and gunshot feels real and impactful, and it's clear that a lot of time and effort went into perfecting each moment. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI is also noteworthy, as it makes the action feel more grounded and visceral.The supporting cast in John Wick 4 also deserves recognition for their performances. Halle Berry is a standout, and her character's relationship with John Wick adds an emotional layer to the movie. Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane, who both appeared in previous films, continue to deliver excellent performances, and their characters' interactions with John Wick are always a joy to watch.The music in John Wick 4 is yet another aspect that deserves praise. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard once again provide a score that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music builds tension and excitement, and it enhances the overall experience of watching the movie.Of course, as with any action movie, there are some flaws. The plot can be convoluted at times, and some of the characters' motivations may not be entirely clear. However, these issues are easily forgiven in light of the incredible action and performances.In conclusion, John Wick 4 is the ultimate action sequel. Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, and Lance Reddick all deliver outstanding performances, and the stunts, direction, and music all contribute to making this movie a must-see for action fans. The franchise continues to raise the bar for what an action movie can be, and John Wick 4 is no exception. If you're looking for a thrilling and entertaining ride, then don't miss this movie.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","olcare","22 March 2023","First of all, I went to the cinema as soon as it came out and I must say that it should never be watched outside of the cinema. It's an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching. Its really really good action movie.From a technical perspective, the film is phenomenal, especially the bird's-eye view scene. My mouth was wide open, it was amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the action. Every fight choreography was well thought out, yes, some parts were exaggerated, but it suited the pace very well. The staircase scene is the biggest example of making these long and single-shot action scenes aesthetic, and it's a great achievement.In terms of acting, I think it was very good. Even though Keanu Reeves played emotionless at times, this role suits him very well. Especially there is one name that fits perfectly, Bill Skarsg√•rd, he played amazingly and I loved it. Also, Killa, played by Scott Adkins, was amazing. It was one of the most entertaining scenes I've watched in a long time, even though the fight with John was a bit weird, it was fantastic. I watched it breathlessly. I won't mention everyone individually, but the performances were more than enough from the stunt doubles to the one-scene actors.It improves the action of the first 2 films and develops the lack of subject matter or subject matter presentation in the 3rd film, making a very aesthetic mix. They covered the biggest flaw in this series.Also, another good thing was the harmony of the music to the scenes, every music was perfectly fine, which I think increased the pleasure of the action scenes by a click or two.There is not much to say, it's a satisfying, exciting, and aesthetic film. Although it lacks emotionally at times, it never stands out and uses its time wonderfully. I loved the movie, and I highly recommend watching it in the cinema instead of waiting to watch it at home.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","qstufie","24 March 2023","If you enjoyed JW 1-3, you can't miss this one. It's the ultimate visual feast of blood, bullets and magic, yes magic, read on.It started with JW getting out of the situation alive (again) after falling off the top of hotel continental and continue to rid the world of fellow hitmen (yeah why were there no hitwemen, just wondering).Except that he gets a partner this time, no one else but Ip Man himself, or maybe Zatoichi, yeah more like Zatoichi with eyes can't see, and a cane sword (sword cane)? And aptly named 'Cane'. Except that Cane kills him at the end, anyway that's not important.What's important is, the action! The action is over the top (not that the first 3 wasn't over the top, but this time it's over the topmost of the previous tops), so normally JW uses the ground as his weapon, now he uses cars as well, and stairs.Damn I would hate these stairs, especially when you just finished climbing up 20 flights of stairs and got kicked back to the very begining of it. But they do act as effective weapons when you toss the body of your enemies on top the stairs.And the magic!First of all, the fantastic animal, this time, in a dog form, who listens to her emotional support companion (the tracer)'s commands, and acts accordingly. Honestly I think she needs anger management that's why she has an emotional support human for her.Then there's the weapon that shoots fireballs and light up anything they touch - just like in the games - yeah also top down view, reminds me of the orginal psx grand theft auto, but way more fancier. Heck even the ragdoll movements of the bodies were just so ... identical. I totally enjoyed that.That's 2 and half hours total enjoyment without a break - don't drink too much water before or during the movie and you can thank me later.Now, why only 8 points?Well, also the action - they must have changed the action director cos this time the enemies don't swarm JW anymore, they wait, like civialised citizens, they take turns to hit him, and only when the first one is down the second one will join, there was no rush at all. So yeah I have to take 2 stars off for that reason.Overall, very enjoyable and certainly will get the bluray when it comes out (yes I have the first 3 on 4k bluray).Don't let your kids watch it, they might get the wrong idea like wow I can be that strong and take on the world by myself.No son, you can't, you are more likely to get a bullet through your brain, don't try that.","

Come on. Really? How can this man be so skilled in hand to hand combat? How can he hit a target (John Wick) with a gun while standing 60 paces apart?And wow...the dance club scene...all that violence, fighting and gun shot happening and yet the crowd just keeps dancing as if they don't see nor hear any of it...at least not until the very end of the scene. THEN everyone begins to scream and run out. WTH??Suspension of disbelief is required for most movie viewing, but damn...this one just gets so ridiculous that it becomes laughable.And then in the end, John dies from multiple gun shots from a blind man.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","rgkarim","24 March 2023","LIKESActing
-It's simplistic, it's extreme, and it's these characters that you love to just grip on to in the grand scheme of things.-And yet it all works together in this action heavy movie, to still create these elements that you love in this film to have a little more meat than some other films in the action genre.-I disagree with the top billing, but I have a trend so.-Georgiou is fine for the like three minutes in the film, and sadly his story does not have much merit to the film, so let's move on.-Ian McShane is excellent as Winston, cultured, classy, and though not the star, stealing the show in those moments with well-executed class, poise, and comedic delivery.Bill Skarsg√•rd is great in the villain role again. Not quite as dynamic, but captures his dad's intensity as the big baddy who causes a lot of trouble with ruthless efficiency.Donnie Yen is awesome in the action roles, and he has an incredible prowess in choreography and delivery to make him a stand up character in this universe, like Rogue One on adult steroids.Shamier Anderson is good for the times he's in, and that's all I can say to not give too much away. Quite, calculating, but gifted in the edge of this action series, he belongs well in this chapter and universe for many things.-Fisburne is fine for when he is on stage, he just needed more time, involvement and dare I say development that Chapter 3 and the commercial s promised.-As for Reeves, the man may not be the best actor, but he is awesome in terms of stunts, very blunt edges, comedic delivery (intentional and unintentional), and just that feeling by saying little. He struggles with, well some other things, but somehow it works given his character.The Story Building
-I've said it several times, but yeah, there is a bit more of the story in this one and much more character development than the past.-Wick's fourth chapter really starts to expand upon Wick's background, while opening up the facets of new characters and trying to help build more of the past.-It's endearing, it's deeper, and establishes layers to characters for books, and other media can expand upon if the movies ever dry up or won't go down the prequel path.-And this particular chapter has enough of the now moments to help things really engage and be intense to help Wick's story continue to expand into levels that just make you continue to root for this character.-Which leads to the next like.The Emotions Surprisingly
-This movie is emotional because it really pushes into those little divots from the past and extends them to more engaging character moments.-Chapter 4 uses the music, the footage, and the story to great levels and establishes moments that help ground the action and silence the action edge.-And it's extraordinarily balanced to the point that it only adds not takes away from the story, and gives stakes and care to the action sequences they designed.-Having such investments into this movie helps get past the usual stereotype of mindless action without much else, and if you are hooked to Keanu's character, you are in luck with this installment really polishing him up.The Special Effects
-You have to make this movie shine to capture the action and make it really shine in this world that makes ""action"" movies.-It works. Wick's scenes have the sound to capture and bring you into the mix. Bullets bouncing, clips discharging, swords clanging and explosions rattling with the music.-But the audio only goes so far if you don't have the visuals, and Wick's team has you covered there with tricks and trades that make the insanity come to life.-Amidst impressive sets, Wick has stellar visual effects as the extras go flying from the stunts as computer and reality combines to make believable bouts of death on the screen.-Flashes of guns, people falling back, blood, and reactions all work together and really make things that insane bout of action that I expected and love in this series.-And it's all captured with camera work and editing that doesn't get lost to shaky work, or that realistic found footage twist that annoys me with some action films. That works super well with me.The Action Sequences
-The heart of this movie, Wick is all about the action. Clocking in at roughly 88% of the movie by my calculations, Wick's longest film adds A LOT MORE action than I anticipated.-Simplistic at first, the movie evolves to add story elements to each fight, while also adding different styles to help diversify the profile , which I greatly appreciated.-Sword fights with physical moves and gunplay opens up at one point, and then we switch to different combats the next as the five sequences help add new styles to freshen things up.-And again it works with the emotion and the story to help add that stakes I like, alongside some of the justice filled finishes you love so much.Dislikes:Too late for this level of Storytelling
-Was the storytelling too late? In a sense for me, yes. Wick may not be known for the plot, but to take such strides and character development this late in the game might have been weaker to me.-These new relationships seem random. The history lost to the fast pace and stunts, that they don't have the full time to commit for me to be worth it.-Throw in the ploy to potentially capitalize on it further and well... it's not the worst, but it just didn't have the full meat I think they could have done.Some Plots Rushed
-The fast pace means the attempts to build plots is also very quick, this film trying to tie many elements from 1-3 into one film, which means lots of details to revisit.-Nostalgia wise, it worked for me, but these moments were very quick, and limber, again leading to a weaker story in my opinion.-For an action flick it's good, but for the legacy of Wick, it could have been better, and perhaps this is going to be a lead in to some spin off given the trend of Hollywood and streaming.Loud In My Showing
-I may sound old, but if you have sensitive ears, caution for the movie is very loud to the point it can be very distracting.-If you too are sensitive, just exercise caution so you don't injure anything.Still Some Level of Absurdity
-I know Wick is already extreme and absurd at times, but I'm always looking to see where they go too far.-And this movie has a few moments that are a bit hard to swallow and ignore at the cheese factor that they take to make their fantasy come to life.-One thing is the costumes they adorn and how selective their immunity is, there is a little more explanation, but it's quite amazing to see the double standards.-Other times it's about the invincibility factor that Wick seems to have, alongside the recovery part that gets stretched a little too much for my tastes. It might be part of the magic, but, the absurdity still is going a tad too far since the first movie.The Final Sequence Makes the Movie A Tad Long
-I'm one for action, but in this case, the final fight sort of extends the feature a bit longer than I personally enjoy given how absurd the final moment is.-A climb so to speak goes a tad longer, and though the moves are awesome, the comedy great and the tying of things together works... it does not offset that it wasn't needed given what was coming.-Chapter 4's length is going to be a solid hook for the die-hard fanbase, but for others like me, that final fight just goes a tad too long given there is still another action moment to come.The After Credit Scenes
-The fact there is one has me shake my head, but that aside, this chapter serves as something to try to tie up a loose story end they forgot, or maybe set the stage for what is next.-All I can say is that a long list of names to get there was mediocre in terms of what could be set up when it comes the world the High-Table focuses on. But was it needed? My opinion... no, not at all.The VERDICT:
John's fourth adventure was shaping to be one of the best action movies for me in a long time, and perhaps one of the best in this series. It's got heart, emotion, and depth I did not expect as the worlds collided and it balanced a lot of things to integrate into the action moments. The movie is visually impressive, a stunning collaboration of sound and video that combined with the planning, just gives this elite fighting movie moxie to make you squirm in your seat. And with all the dark antics and violence, this genre really does have a pinnacle sequel on hand to give the fans more of what they want, but actually push the envelope with it. And yet.. the movie still has things that are needing fine tuning to push to the pinnacle of movies. Absurdity is one thing, but pacing still has some things to work on to help give the movie the bite it wants, alongside the fact of trying to do a pinch more of character balancing that they seem to struggle. Nevertheless, this movie is definitely the leading film of the month right now, and has many things to drag you to the theater to see it. My scores are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 9.0Movie Overall: 8.0.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","grinningelvis","25 October 2023","Somebody thought it was a good idea to wedge some painfully dull melodrama in between the violence. What's with all this talking? This upsets me, because - simply put - every line of dialogue just means one less killshot to the head. The idea that these cardboard characters supposedly have ""inner lives"" is hilarious. The only ""inner"" I care about is their CGI blood.Honestly, I didn't really watch this movie, or any of the John Wick movies. I'm sure they exist, but nothing here registers in the permanent memory. I think a guy fell down some steps. Mostly they play in the background while I go about thinking on better movies and not killing people. But I thought it important to add a review here because I was astounded at how this artfully dumb and endlessly repetitive series continues to justify incredibly long screen times. Donnie Yen talks a bit. Ian McShane phones in his McShaneiest version of McShane. Is that Clancy Brown? He seems to be doing something. Oh, a fight scene! But 3 hours of this?My question for the John Wick universe is why? Video games already exist, and you get to control the character. Isn't that more fun than three hours of bladder-control tedium?Hey look, Donnie Yen's not dead yet! What hour is this?","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","vjspyjwpr","1 April 2023","This is by far the worst of the 4 John Vick movies. It doesn't explain much to the viewers about what is going on and why. As in the other Vick movies the hero kills and kills, in many scenes they have so many killers coming at him and shooting that it would seem to be impossible for him not to get shot. He does wear Kevlar suits but Kevlar suits do not cover his whole body and Kevlar generally will not stop bullets from long barreled weapons such as assault rifles which are in use throughout the movie. In a 'shoot 'em up' movie like this the viewer has to suspend belief and just enjoy the action but the writer(s) and director took too many liberties, the movie isn't believable - even with suspended belief. At 2 hrs and 45 minutes, this movie is way too long, to fill that time they included long scenes of killing bad guys and it gets very repetitive and tedious. You should skip this movie, it's not worth 2 hr and 45 minutes of your life.","

This movie felt like one long fight scene with a little dialogue mixed in. I could have done with a lot more story dialogue and a lot less fighting. The other movies felt like the fight scenes were part of the story and this one feels like they did fight scenes just to do fight scenes.It's kinda hard to put into words but watch it, and I recommend watching it, and you'll see what I mean. You might like it a lot more than I did.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","sehestedlasse","24 March 2023","Such a bad movie. 3 hour long fight where John has put on ""godmode"". Absolutely 0 story, besides just fighting. The whole theatre bursted out laughing because of the ridiculous fightscenes. I am left so angry and annoyed. Don't you ever go watch this pile of poop if you like anything that is the slightest realistic. More unrealistic than Marvel movies. It has absoluty nothing to offer. A blind guy who can fight, shoot and play cards? What is this? Maybe 12-13 year old kids would find this movie cool. This is as stupid as it gets. John Wick says nothing in the movie. It is absolutely pointless and meaningless.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","ykjdh","24 March 2023","This is by far the best action movie to come out the past 15 years! Yup, I said it and stand by it! Can you find a movie character more exciting than John Wick?? Jason Bourne is a close second but the visuals in this franchise make this series fun to watch.Fast forward to this installment where the stakes are higher for John Wick. There are a lot of twists and turns in this one, along with some of the best fight choreography in movies. The longer running time didn't really seem like much since the pacing of this film is fast and exciting.One note: Lance Reddick's final onscreen performance was sentimental to watch. It's hard not to think about what happen recently with his passing while promoting this movie. Other supporting characters make it woke up until the very end but Reddick will be missed.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","aaronka-16580","28 June 2023","This is the same movie as the first three. Here is the plot John Wick wants out as an assassin, and people are trying to kill him. The main difference in this one is it is much, much longer than the previous films.Suspending belief is necessary in most action movies, but this one takes the cake. Bullet proof jackets, that look like normal jackets, that can stop bullets from point blank range, check.Inept goons who willingly run to their ultimate death, check.Whole squads of goons waiting one by one to challenge our hero, check.It's all here, and it's all been done before. Bottom line is, the movie is too long, and to monotonous. Wick fanboys will love it. Older folks who have seen decades of action movies will think it's just meh.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","User145111","2 June 2023","Another John Wick film, another unbelievable shooting fest. Unbelievable in the sense that one cannot believe how useless and incompetent everyone in the film is. Apart from the eponymous John Wick of course.Every single goon/henchmen in this film acts as though they've never held a gun before in their lives. They constantly run out of cover, fail to react to anything happening in their surroundings and have precisely zero survival instinct. In this world John Wick is a legend. Everyone has heard of him and act as though he is the devil himself due to his skill and willpower. One would think then that the goons would know not to get close to him due to his grabbing, grappling and gun-fu abilities. Nope. They will happily run around without a care in the world acting as though they practically wish for death.You know how everyone in this universe has a bulletproof suit? Maybe aim for the head every so often. Or, just flail around and allow for your attacks to ping off of John Wick's torso.It's incredibly distracting. Reeves just seems tired to the point of taking Wick's melancholy, stoic personality to new levels of boring. Fair play to him for being the age that he is and committing to the stunts as much as he does. If only the fight coordinators could muster similar levels of enthusiasm for their work.Blind Donnie Yen makes no sense.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","tohmsono","23 May 2023","It's been a while since i watched such a dragged out and shallow movie with horribly unrealistic fighting and shooting sequences. Also, none of the characters have any depth, i guess that was never really the intent of the writers, to go deep into the personas, but this flick is so silly and boring it was really hard to sit thru till the end. The sheer amount of assassins that cannot pull off a head shot from 10 meters away is perplexing. To go into all of the illogicalities of this flick would be a tedious and long task, so in summary: it's like watching a video game. All of the reviews above 5 are simply because they like Keanu, but do not get fooled: this flick is garbage.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","na-09069","29 May 2023","A funny or very sad movie?I watched this movie with a friend while we did eat our ordered in dinner.At first, we tried to take it seriously, but it got hilarious as the movie progressed. How many rounds can you shoot with a gun? Kill hundreds of people and not get hit by a bullet even once? Rolling down a 222 steps high stone staircase while hitting your head many times and then walk right up again to kill whoever is in the way? And a blind man who knows how to hit his opponents every single time, be it with a gun, a pistol or whatever. He even knows how to play cards and knows exactly which cards he puts on the table?And then the sweet lips almost pressed against a 50's looking microphone keeping the swarms of hitmen, that all seemed to be tuned in on the same radio frequency, informed about the whereabouts of their mark? In how many movies did we see this before?We could laugh about it all, but think about all these youngsters who take this as a possible reality: shoot everybody who is in your way and shoot as many people as you can. Seeing Mr. Wick as their role model in this brainless violence tsunami.Well, I guess playing a role like that pays well. But still there are people in the States asking ""Why is it that we have so many (school) shootings in our country?"" Maybe Mr. Reeves has an answer to that.","

I'm pretty sure out of the hundred of people that were murdered in this movie, they were the same 5 stunt actors over and over again.I went with my buddies to this movie. Afterward we all thought this movie was horrible. One thought it was a comedy, because of the way the killings happen. I felt the assassins trying to kill Wick could have been soccer moms with no fighting experience, it was that off at how they could miss shooting a guy standing next to him. I dozed off for about 10 minutes.Overall there's no plot or story. It's just a bunch of confusing nonsense and horrible acting. This will be a forgettable movie. Do yourself a favor and skip it.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","mr-giroro","6 July 2023","This movie has achieved something that no other movie has ever achieved: This is a long movie with a running time of almost 3 hours (2 hours and 49 minutes), but the entire 169 minutes are simply an endless repetition of the same 10-second clip -- i.e., Keanu Reeves shoot a guy twice on the chest, grapple him, shoot one more time on the head, and refresh and repeat with another guy.Other than this, there is absolutely nothing in the movie. No decent story. No decent acting. No reasonable character development. Nothing. There is not even a single memorable action scene in the movie as all the scenes are something they have already used in the previous movies in the series. Each action sequence lasts good 10-15 minutes, and it was excruciating to watch them because it was so boring to watch the same action scene over and over.If you take a 10 minutes action sequence from the original John Wick and repeat it for 17 times, you will get John Wick 4. This is truly atrocious. Our time is worth much more than this.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","lenses-39397","30 May 2023","John Wick 1 was over the top - but a plausible story for Hollywood purposes, and very entertaining. It has devolved to JW4 which is virtually unwatchable as a movie. If you can COMPLETELY suspend logic, you may be able to muddle through, but that isn't me. I can't believe it is many others either, but then again, sadly it is. Piece of crap would be complimentary.The fight scenes are a joke of complete disbelief.The story is weak.Blind guys can not avoid bullets in a gunfight/
Kevlar ""suits"" can not protect wearers from grave harm.""Everyone"" can not be thisclose to being able to beat the greatest ever.Women can't realistically fight highly skilled warrior men - no less multiple men.The sad thing is that this COULD HAVE been done well. The formula for a JW movie is ""the boogeyman."" Every extra in the movie can not come close to that level - that is horse crap. Trying to make each movie bigger and more extreme than the last is a mistake, destined for failure. This movie failed miserably. Writer, director, producers - complete hacks.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","stuit","28 March 2023","I paid $10 usd to see this movie at a matinee. The eye candy made the price worth it. That said, eye candy is almost all this experience offers. Most everyone involved in this film seemed like they were sleepwalking when the action stopped. It doesn't matter - everything in this picture is done for style points. There's barely any story here at all, and what story exists is so thin that it could be told in about 2 minutes of this 169 minute film. The remaining attempt to tell a story is so full of holes supported by bad acting and bloated style that it would have been a much better film just to leave it all out and just show a montage of fight sequences.The Marquis character never shows the ability to do anything except sneer in an outrageous French accent and surround himself with dumb lieutenants. The Bowery King and the Harbinger characters are trotted out at the beginning and the end of the story just to to provide some atmosphere.Rina Sawayama's acting ability is confined to contorting her face in into pithy expressions in response to her character's father's philosophical meanderings.Even though small arms fire fills the air and bodies pile up on the road, cars continue to drive around the Champs-√âlys√©es as if nothing is happening.The same thing happens during the disco scene, where perfect 20-something bodies continue to obliviously dance away while axe killings splatter blood all around them.The DJ drops the needle on a record to start a song (bad sign for a DJ), while the old reel-to-real tape keeps spinning...just because they look better spinning I guess.This isn't really a movie; it's more like a moving painting. I'm grateful for the resolution at the end of the film, because I feel sorry that the actors and the characters they play have to keep living out this drivel.","

When I first heard about it, I couldn't help but think of logic gaps, but hold on tight because this film hosts a record-breaking 10 kills per square meter in a single scene! The protagonist is truly a living legend, throwing action parties that span across continents.The finale of the film is absolutely mind-blowing, but wait a minute! John Wick has taken such a beating that he looks like he survived an avalanche! If it weren't for these flaws, it would easily deserve a perfect 10/10, but due to these minor hiccups, I'll give it a well-deserved 9/10. Nevertheless, let's not forget that this film is still legendary!Now, let's talk about the cinematography. The colors are explosive, as if they were on fire! The camera transitions are mesmerizing, almost like a dance with the action scenes. And the soundtrack fits the action sequences perfectly, as if the next fight song selection was a DJ's responsibility! This film is a treat for those who appreciate the art of action.And I can't go on without mentioning one thing: Keanu Reeves! We love you, man! Your performance in this film was fantastic, and we thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in the world of action with you!In conclusion, this film is destined to captivate action enthusiasts. If you don't dwell on the logic gaps, it offers a mind-bending and outrageously intense action experience. After watching this film, you'll find yourself expecting an action scene at every step, even in real life. Get ready for the ride of a lifetime!","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","Sunsphxsuns","28 March 2023","John Wick Chapter 4 is everything you'd want from this tremendously popular franchise. I would describe it as pure ""choreographed aggression,"" like a delicate ballet. But instead of Swan Lake, this is all about bullets and knives. Incidentally, don't trouble yourself with a body count. The sheer number and intensity of ""kills"" will truly elude you.JW4 rather nicely returns for a riot of startling violence tempered by a melange of perfectly cerebral philosophical moments. Unlike the sardonic ""ultra violence"" of Stanley Kubrick's, A Clockwork Orange (1971), JW4 is sensibly raw, with just enough creepy humor to keep you from completely jumping out of your own skin.It doesn't hurt that JW4 has a great cast. Reeves immediately sells Wick & company's dark commitment with a raw emotion somewhat reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood Western. The massive emotional exhaustion which unfolds simply adds more gravity to this newest Chapter. ""Sauce for the goose,"" one might say.Flaws? Very few. And JW fans won't care. This is what makes cinema so FUN, especially now that we're all feeling some relief in this post-pandemic world. JW4 is heavy, exciting, and has plenty of authentic action. You will NOT be disappointed!!!!","

I found it really bland and boring.The main issue was that the stunts felt like they pulled a lot of punches. Almost every action sequence felt numb, like they didn't have any weight or any stakes. Fight scenes would go for far too long and yet leave absolutely no impact. Someone could fall off of a building, shake it off and be totally fine again. There were acrobatics, sure, but it felt like Power Rangers combat.It also felt like this installment was being crushed under the weight of its own lore. The hints of greater lore and underlying history in the other movies were great, and part of what got me really interested in the continuing franchise. By the fourth installment this has become so all encompassing that it absorbs the whole movie in a convoluted plot of pomp and politics.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","mike_morais_15","27 March 2023","The only two parts I loved about the movie was at Berlin with the fat German guy and at New York's library. The rest of the movie was a parody of the firsts movies: John gets run over by cars, falls from buildings, gets stabbed multiple times and gets back up immediately like it was nothing. Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby. Not intimidating at all...
To conclude, I was expecting more realistic scenes, more real motives for John to be angry against the High Table, more charismatic characters like the German fat guy and more original fighting scenes( like in the other movies where he goes from a arms museum to a horse stable üòÇ).","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","LukasValk","29 May 2023","(SPOILER FREE PART)It feels like every John Wick movie is a remastered version of a previous one. Better choreography, better fight scenes, better visuals, bigger budged but it's more or less the same movie with the same meh story and the same meh characters. Of course most of us know what a John Wick movie is so no one's surprised here. And if it is exactly what you're expecting than you won't be disappointed.FIRST, THE GOOD THINGSCinematography and production design, especially the colours. The colour palette is beautiful, maybe overdone here and there but most of the time it's just beautiful.Fight scene choreography is top tier as it was in previous movies and probably even better.Music is pretty good and in combination with the visuals it creates a really stylish and pleasant to look at movie.THE NOT SO GOOD THINGSThe characters are kind of cheesy as is the whole story, it's not terrible but it is not memorable.Also there's this feeling about this movie that the only thing that the creators were focusing on is how to improve action sequences at any cost even if it makes movie completely unrealistic. And I GET IT it is not supposed to be very realistic but at least it should be somewhat believable because sometimes it is so not believable that it's just breaking the immersion where this could be avoided.The worst part for me was the disconnection between the fight scenes and the surroundings like everything that happens to the characters happens in this fake world. It felt like the everything around the ones involved in the fights is just there to make it look good and make us believe that all of this is happening in the real world and not a movie set but it completely fails at that and feels like like some kind of exhibition of fight choreography.(SPOILERS BELOW)Couple of examples :Heaven and Hell nightclub scene.People mindlessly dancing and not paying attention to the gun chase that is happening in front of them. Shots were fired, axes were thrown, people were running, fist fighting, bleeding, falling down from deadly heights. Almost nobody cared. I GET IT we are supposed to believe that the music is very loud, people are maybe under influence of alcohol or whatever else but I mean come on shot were fired...The Place de l'Etoile roundabout shootout.This scene was very similar to the aforementioned.Once again the unresponsiveness from the cars around them was very immersion breaking. People were driving around like nothing is happening even though dead bodies should be lying around, multiple people walking and shooting in the middle of extremely busy traffic. Every car in the scene felt like was driven by the NPCs from a video game that have their dedicated route and it doesn't matter if they hit your with a car or not they will continue to go like nothing happened. And the end of the scene they show you the aftermath so you would think that this whole thing had some kind of effect to the traffic but until that point it didn't feel like that at all.Also the whole fight scene was so unnecessary long just to show some crazy moments were the baddies and John Wick himself was hit by the cars multiple times. At least those moments were indeed impressive. But if the scene was at least a lot shorter it wouldn't be as unbelievable as it was.And the scene on the stairs...was it really necessary? Did people actually enjoy yet another super long shootout scene where Wick kills yet another 50 bad guys but now on his way up the stairs (twice!) We've seen that already.And the blind guy...I mean come on he's blind...All these things that I've mentioned does not make John Wick 4 a bad movie but it is definitely not the best action movie as some wants to claim it may not even be the best overall John Wick movie.If you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the fight choreography you will probably enjoy it, but it feels like JW4 wants you to turn off your brain the most out of all 4 movies.All in all the movie wasn't bad, it's a bit too long, too unrealistic and the ending is unsatisfying.","

Always additional opponents showing up - but of course always just two at a time and in the same order - two masked ones, two in suits, and then starting again with two masked ones etc. What a pity.There is only one nice thing - even though you could consider it as a bit too much: Camera and light were really great.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","GusherPop","28 March 2023","Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have returned with ""John Wick: Chapter 4,"" a film that was supposed to hit theaters two years ago. It was worth the wait, combining the mythology-heavy approach of the last couple chapters with the streamlined action of the first film, resulting in a final hour that is among the best of the genre. John Wick: Chapter 4 opens with Wick (Reeves) on the run from the villainous Powers That Be known as the High Table. The main villain of the series is the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsg√•rd), a leader of the High Table who keeps raising the bounty on Wick's head while he also cleans up the messes left behind. The opening scenes take Wick to Japan, where he seeks help from the head of the Osaka Continental, Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), and runs afoul of a blind High Table assassin named Caine (Donnie Yen). Laurence Fishburne pops up as Wick's Q when the killer needs a new bulletproof suit, and Shamier Anderson plays an assassin waiting for the price to hit the right level for him to get his payday. Despite the movie's epic runtime (169 minutes), the plot feels refreshingly focused again. The only minor flaw in Wick's armor is a bit of narrative self-indulgence, but fans won't care. This is a movie that should be seen with a cheering, excited crowd, as it has that contagious energy and is meant to be watched loud and big. John Wick has fought hard for it. The stunts and fight choreography of John Wick are top tier, and the director, Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman.""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is by far the best of the four films starring Keanu Reeves as the eponymous hit man. It has many of the same problems as its predecessors, but something happens late in the game that converts the film's merely technical displays of bloody murder into something suspenseful and romantic. Director Chad Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and there's fresh blood in the cast, most notably Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth. The details are too good to give away, but there's no harm and much pleasure in considering how the movie climbs to that light-headed summit. The movie reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. The stunt work is spectacular, with human bodies being hurled into moving vehicles and Reeves's double tumbling down the Sacr√©-Coeur stairs. Stahelski also delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in a single shot, the camera floating overhead. Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and introduces fresh blood in the cast, such as Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth.","

Now to some criticism. As others have mentioned, most of the fight scenes were choreographed so embarrassingly bad that I spent most of the film watching bad guys standing off to the side and waiting for their turn for John Wick to kill them. We see literally hundreds of trained assassins pointing and shooting high powered automatic weapons John at (who is usually standing out in the open) and yet non ever strike John. John falls flat on his face from the top of a building, gets hit 5 times by speeding cars,rolls down 6 flights of stairs after being pummeled relentlessly and in every case gets up almost none worse for wear. Even his suit never got dirty. At some points I accidentally laughed out loud.A huge, huge plot hole was the radio announcer stating John's every move and update (including the increasing bounty money for killing John Wick). There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time. Who listens to radio now anyway?The ending!?! Did he die? Did I miss it? One minute he's shot but still walking, talking needing a little rest and bath. The next scene shows his tombstone. Totally disappointing vague ending.I had no idea how long the film was. It actually went fairly quickly although most of the fight scenes were double the length I felt they needed to be.","

I know that is the key element in this story, but people still need a good story, and some actual acting. As it was released, it is already quite long. So, I feel that they could have eliminated much of the ridiculous fighting in the traffic circle of Paris and added more meat to the story. Too much of the movie was incomplete. There could have been more for Lawrence Fishburne. And they could have done more with Shamier Anderson. I understand that they wanted to close out the series with John Wick's name restored. So, they could have done more, in the latter half of the movie, with his efforts to restore his name. This movie just didn't come together for me. As it stands, I think John Wick should have died at the end of John Wick 3.","

Notice I didn't say actor in movies as I think that after about 20-30 movies we can all honestly say that his skills have not improved nor have they changed. Having said that I will say that he is enjoyable to watch in movies like this even though I had to suspend my disbelief of my suspension of disbelief on multiple occasions. The story was not very interesting, the bad guy didn't seem very bad nor was I feeling like any of the action scenes made any sense - not that any movies really do. But I wonder just how many times a person needs to place a mag in a loaded weapon and then open the chamber to see if there is a round in the chamber. That was minor because I don't want to spoil alert anyone. I will say this however that if a spin-off is made or another John Wick is made I can honestly say I will not pay any money to watch either.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","matthewjones-56423","23 March 2023","This movie is so bad that I stopped watching it inside the theater to write this review...What happened here?!? I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I come to see ""John Wick"" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three films to shine is gone. The ""John Wick"" franchise has completely disappeared up its own a*s. This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no ""real world"" anymore. Every single character in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.Now, let's discuss the action and the fight choreography, the two biggest letdowns about this film. This was not just bad fight choreography for the Wick universe, this was bad fight choreography for a straight-to-streaming action movie of the week. As Wick is fighting various henchmen in the ubiquitous club fight scene that goes down in every Wick movie, you can literally see the enemy assailants waiting their turn to attack him. Numerous times, you can clearly see a henchman in the background literally just standing there swinging his weapon at nothing because it isn't his turn yet in the choreography to attack Wick.Also, the ""Gun-Fu"" crap was novel and fun in the first two movies, now it's completely taken over. Rather than the dazzling martial arts, melee weapons, and close quarters combat we've come to expect from this franchise, we're now forced to settle for an endless barrage of gunfire and gratuitous headshots. There is very little actual brawling in this film. It's like the scene in Indiana Jones when he opts to just shoot the sword-wielding henchman rather than actually fight him. ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is just that scene repeated over and over and over again. Every time a new villain squares off to John and appears that they will be formidable, Wick just shoots them in the head immediately without even so much as a slap fight to satiate our palettes. It gets so boring to watch really fast. I think Keanu is getting up there in years and can't quite bring the fury like he used to; so, the filmmakers decided to just let him shoot everybody rather than fight them.Now, let's go back to the big club scene and talk about how unrealistic this movie is. During the scene, the sprawling night club is packed to the rafters with club goers who appear to be dancing to different music than that which is playing. That's not even close to the silliest thing about them though. As though they were brainless party bots that knew only how to dance, these morons would just stand there gyrating poorly to generic Cyberpunk music while people were being brutally slaughtered by axe right next to them. None of them bats an eye, runs away, or attempts to protect themselves. They just keep on dancing like the NPCs inside a night club on Grand Theft Auto. It was some of the most negligent filmmaking I've ever seen.Simply put, there was no grace to this film and it was a horrible way to end the franchise. To all of you out there saying that this is ""the best action film of all time,"" maybe you should rent ""The Raid: Redemption"" or ""The Raid 2."" Those are action films done so well they were basically art films. Iko Uwais is the most talented martial arts working in film today. Or, even easier, go rent ""Atomic Blonde."" As a former ballerina, Charlize Theron was able to memorize in excess of twenty moves at a time, which resulted in the directors needing to cut much less frequently, creating a very seamless, realistic effect to her fight scenes. The director referred to her as belonging to ""the top 1% of actors who can perform their own action."" ""Atomic Blonde"" is one of the best action films of all time and no one seemed to notice it. Such a crime...Anyway, ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" sucked. You're better off staying home and sticking your head in the oven. Don't waste your money seeing this film in the theaters. It'll be on cable eventually, so just wait for it. This movie is where dreams go to die. Score: D+","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","rich-mac","27 May 2023","There really is very little story time - maybe 20 minutes of the runtime - but probably not that much. The rest is just basically the same kind of fight scene, repeated over and over in different locations. The locations are mostly great - the monotonous action wears very thin quite early on.I seem to remember that some of the earlier Wick movies had proper story lines - somewhere along the line they ditched them for non-stop repetitive action - action that stretches credulity well past breaking point - but some of it, especially towards the end, was ridiculous nonsense.For any serious movie buff this installment completely fails to make the grade and is a total waste of time. Worse, it sullies the franchise.2 stars for the locations, and because it's professionally made technically.Minus 8 points for the lack of an engaging story and for reaching a new high for banal gratuitous violence.Summary:
So bad it's almost funny. But it's not funny, it's vacuous nonsense that cost a fortune to produce.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","dimitrije-stopar-157-311845","17 September 2023","The producers have made another, even more ""Wicky"" movie. I was shocked to see the ratings of other sequels, so the latter didn't even surprise. The story could have been told in a minute. The fight scenes, and there isn't anything else in the movie, are shot so that we can see Reeves' martial arts abilities. Nobody did him a favor with that. I saw the movie in three parts because I couldn't stand it all. I understand that violence sells but so do drugs. You, the whole mobie industry, are responsible for what is happening. I know my words won't be read by any significant individual but I just wanted to contribute a spark in awareness.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","drshantiprasad","30 September 2023","Like many other sequels this series is falling apart. There is hardly any story. All his enemies are brainless. No snipers in the whole series. 50 guys attacking a single guy but all forget to use the gun and start freestyle fight. Mr Caine is blind but no one can shoot him. The villain is stereotypically rich, arrogant but handsome who doesn't get a chance to show his fighting skills. His chapter ends with a single bullet. John's body is made up of high grade titanium alloy. He gets hit by a car 10 times, falls from the stairs 10 times, survives a fall from 4 th floor window, never gets shot in head even when bullets are raining.....

"John Wick: Chapter 4","hanschsolo","1 April 2023","While John Wick 4 points with extraordinary beautiful cinematography and some well-made action sequences, it fails apart at two key points when it comes to movies for me.Firstly the plot. What is this even about? Who knows. People care for the action. But why do we then need to watch more than one hour of build-up for the action, you could watch the action without understanding what is going on, you don't need to know why these people fight, there is no conflict, and even if there is, it doesn't matter, because it has no consequences to the plot. The problem is that the plot is only sequenced trough talking, no visual language.That makes the movie feel like a video-game. The action-scenes are the one you interactively play, and the talking scenes are just long cut scenes. This Formula works for many games, but you can skip those cut-scenes. If it's a good game, the gameplay will make your blood rush and you will not care for that dialogue pause. Best example is Hitman, you don't care for the story, you just want to play.What is John Wicks Goal? I as a Viewer, gather nothing from the motivation of revenge, since the first movie the goal is the same, and it doesn't carry the weight of the first one. He does this all because of the last present his woman gave him, because of a dog. And while the film could dive into wicks character and analyze his psyche, and his former relationship to his woman, because she's the reason of this all happening, It rather focuses on an old friendship that now turned into an rivalry. I want to understand this man, and empathize with him, but the movie simply doesn't care about it's character work and the plot.Secondly the Pacing. It takes too long for the action to begin, and when it ends, it again takes take long until it begins again. A Simple process. And if the story is not compelling enough, it's hard to get trough.I feel like people are getting easier to please within every year and call everything a masterpiece. People seem to go crazy for mindless action without any substance. Without any conflict and emotion. It's nothing new. It's nothing we didn't had 20 years ago.Yes, the Action is good filmed. The lighting is great, but what does it really matter? Is an good action flick really what we need more of nowadays. The genre is oversaturated. It has no weight anymore for me. Filmmakers need to try and do something fresh. I do not want to turn of my brain during a movie.After one and an half hour during the movie passed, I asked myself an Important Question during the movie.What was the intention of John Wick 4? It was not a Vision the director wanted to show us, because there is no vision. Most importantly, there are no emotions. Nothing to move the audience with. There is no art behind this. Even if it's well made, this whole movie feel feels like an ad.So now, I know exactly what the intention of John Wick 4 was. It was Money.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","purplemania-339-801099","5 June 2023","I liked the other John Wick's. This one was over the top ridiculous. From the blind man that was somehow a better swordsman than everyone and a better shot than everyone to the fat guy that somehow could fight like chuck norris... The movie is about 2:45 with at least 2:15 of that time gun fights at close range where everyone gets hit but no one seems to die.Yes, I realize it's a movie but the unrealistic activities are way too much.. seems more like a version of the animated Batman show from the 70's where the bad guys just keep coming out.... Over and over again...Super explosive fight scenes but no plot whatsoever... very disappointed. I paid $20 for this crap.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","marwinsingh-30063","24 March 2023","There is no denying that John wick series will become an classical masterpiece in future.. If you've seen previous 3 films you then you should know what to expect.. Keanu Reeves is back again legendery hitman aka Baba Yaga who'll stop at nothing to earn his freedom and defeat high table and seeing him doing that will give you an unforgettable cinematic experience.. For 3 hrs I was lost in this epic world that director Chad Stahlski has created for this story, Keanu Reeves is already an action icon, rest of cast has also done a perfect job.. Action choreographer and stunt team deserves an Oscar for their effort which lead us to some of the best fight scenes and action sequences ever played on big screen.. Cinematography is also very beautiful, dark and neon filled visulas just enhance the experience of story there is also some drama and emotional moments in this story but main aspect of this film is out of the world action.. There is a unique over the head camera action scene which is best part of this movie, Donnie yen is also great here proving again that he is one of the best action stars of Asian cinema, Scott Adkins is also done a surprisingly great scene which I was not expecting because he usually play hardcore fighter in his movies here he is hilarious and his look is different.. From start to finish JW 4 is an action ride which gets better and better each passing minute, 3rd act will keep you edge of your seat, last 45 to 50 minutes were some of the best action sequences I've ever seen in my life and I've seen thousands of films from every genere from all over the world cinema industries so i know a good action scene when I see it and believe me this was something I've seen first time in my life.... Overall don't miss this film if you're fan of action movies and if you're an Baba Yaga fan like me then just go for it to experience it on big screen with Dolby atmos sound you'll spend a quality time....AN MODERN ACTION MASTERPIECE.. 10/10 ..","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","icullenengineer","28 May 2023","As a big fan of Mr Reeves (the replacements is his acting apex in my opinion, point break best overall movie) it pains me to rate this even at 4 stars.There is essentially zero plot.Close quarter action sequences dilute this movie to the point of being irrelevant. There is zero plot (I know, please bear with me) evolution with this story, hashed out dialogue that would make James Corden blush, cameos that feel like they're there for no other reason than to create a TV spinoff and cinematography that would make any film school graduate turn in their future grave.You know how you watched the fast and the furious film up until 9 and then went ""naaah that's enough, I'm done""... you'll reach that point with this movie. Watch the first one and bedo e with how good it was....remind me of another Keanu franchise!!","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","hfreinoso","9 April 2023","John Wick Chapter 4, directed by Chad Stahelski and stars Keanu Reeves as the main character John Wick. This is the best film of 2023, already. There I said it. It's already the best film of 2023. John Wick's Chapter 4 is one of the best action films this decade. I enjoy this film, no; I loved this film. I loved this film, My dad and I watched John Wick's Chapter 1 on opening day, and now we watched it on opening day; and Chapter 4 didn't disappoint us at all; we had the best time with this film. Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, and Scott Adkins were brilliant in this film, and they didn't disappoint us in this film as it's such a good plot during this film. The story is well done as it shows and expands the new assassin world. And the action, I can keep going on and on about the action and I am so anticipated that I want to see the movie again, of how good the action is especially the overhead scene that was inspired by Hotline Miami. That scene alone made this film a masterpiece. I could watch it over and over again and I will never get tire of watching it. The story is really good and the ending was a huge plot twist, as we though there were going to make Chapter 5. And in all honesty if they end the story here with John Wick, that would be okay, because, I seriously don't know how on god's earth will they top this film. And If they ever do a Chapter 5, Please bring everybody back that did Chapter 1-4 for Chapter 5. My dad and I are huge fans and we will continue be fans, we love the film and for my dad it's already the best film of 2023 in his eyes. Cinematography, soundtrack, visuals are ALL astounding. There is only a nitpick and that is John Wick still is clean after all the fighting. Overall, John Wick's Chapter 4 is a true masterpiece of action filmmaking. It's a film that manages to exceed the high bar set by its predecessors, delivering a thrilling and emotionally engaging experience that leaves you wanting even more. If you're a fan of action movies or just great filmmaking in general, then John Wick Chapter 4 is an absolute must-see film. I give it a 10/10 rating without reservation. I am wanting this film to get this film a billion dollars at the box office, Because it deserves the money, and time to see on the BIG screen. I am going to see this film over and over again. It's a masterpiece. 10/10.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","AO8","28 May 2023","Was very excited for this movie. Watched the other 3 and thoroughly enjoyed them. However, this one was just okay if not bad? Idk if im getting older (in my late 20's now) and maybe these type of movies just don't entertain me as much they used to, but the fighting scenes were boring. I could see the ""WWE"" in it, and the exaggerated acting of the henchmen. Even with that, i was okay but the exact moment where I just lost interest was the fighting scene in the ""dance club"". You have john fighting and him hacking a guy in the head with an axe, shooting and then even being dragged up the stairs by his tie and the random partying civilians around just....stared and kept dancing? No running or screaming? Wtf? Like even a meth head would run at that sight...Like I get it's not supposed to be absolutely real, i mean tbey have bullet proof suits but. C'mon.","

Easily the overall best action stunt movie for the art. Simple story and Wick indestructible. But so worth it. Fighting up an endless staircase against innumerable foe to the music of Justice. Bravo. The most imaginative chorography fight scenes I have ever seen. They push the limit, the intensity, the absolute insanity how can it not be the perfect action movie created.

"John Wick: Chapter 4","chand-suhas","23 March 2023","John Wick Chapter 4 is lengthy. By lengthy I mean it has an action packed first act followed a slower second act sans much action but makes up for it with the craziest final act where all hell breaks loose. John Wick after surviving the fall in the previous film, gets back to business of killing his way to freedom. The table has found a new head who pits John's friend against him. As the brutal fight resume, John is suggested a clever way out of this mess and how he pulls it off being an ex-communicado forms the story.Donnie Yen's addition to the franchise takes the fourth film a notch higher, raising the bar for the stunts. The first act is indeed action packed and it flies by quicker than the bullets fired. The second act gets the story forward without much action until Scott Adkins shows up, which makes for a stylish action block with enough humor. The highlight is however the final act in Paris. The insane action sequence leading to the final fight gave me my money's worth and also covers up the generic weak villain which Bill Skarsg√•rd tries to make merry off.It is indeed a fitting entry to the franchise and the first John Wick film to have an end credit scene, one has to sit through the end credits completely for that scene.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","meaneye-rcf","20 June 2023","To be honest I didn't like this part of the series. From the moment it starts it's non-stop action with little to no world building, story or character development.People come in, do something, talk about something very important and then leave never to be seen. And it happens multiple times. It's just thing after thing after thing. And it's always boss above bosses. Another secret thing inside of this secret thing inside of this secret world. It's getting old and annoying.Chapter 3 was worse than this from entertainment point of view, but not by much. First movie made you feel emotions and it was very well directed. Second was mostly pointless action but both movies had great pacing. Here it's feels like you are trying to sprint with one leg. We are constantly behind on understanding who the hell are these new people that appeared, why is this happening, why now and why the hell no one remember to get bazooka and hunt Wick. Police is not caring for literally hundreds of dead on the streets of Paris, why would rocket launcher be a problem.Over all it was ""meh"". It happened, I watched it and will never do so again. Unlike the first movie.","

Keanu is still stiff and half asleep throughout the movie and luckily they give him very little dialogue. The other actors are superb especially Donnie Yen, who is an actual martial artist. He's so good he makes Keanu look especially bad. Scott Atkins is great and his martial arts skill shines in this movie.The plot is ridiculous as usual and the killing count is very high. It seems like the director enjoys the same backgrounds.....church, falling down lots of steps, dance hall where everyone keeps dancing even though there is gunfire.It lacks the humor of the Taken movies and great acting in the Equalizer.","

Plot is there just to justify the fight scene after another one. Some people write the fight scenes are on another level I do not agree. For me they seem like a choreography and sluggish. Way to many moves to finish off an opponent. Did anyone count how may times John shot his gun from the car at the huge roundabout? 38 times give and take and just in previous scene when he got the gun from the King he said it holds 21 bullets!!!! Apparently this is not the last one John Wick but just like Fast and Furious this movie gets just ridiculous. Keanu please just stop!!!!","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","luke-retrorocket-gg-96525","22 October 2023","It's an average film. Worst of the 4.So convoluted and extended for no reason other than to show off the brilliant choreography and fight scenes - which were all excellent, dynamic and exciting. Didn't justify the almost 3 hour runtime.However some of them went on for too long that it almost became Family Guy-esque and a bit cringey and laughable. Everybody seemed to have these bulletproof suits on and no one could shoot in the head it seems. The Table were too 'illuminati'-esque, just with unbelievable rituals and rules that seemed to apply when the movie needed a narrative shift.Caine was a laughable character - I can honestly say that didn't know if they were making him walk/move/fight in a certain way to try and get us to empathise with his blindness or trying to make us laugh - in a comedic way.As for comparing to the other three movies, it just didn't feel real anymore - not that much of the other 3 movies are close to reality, haha. Just focussed on the fights and making characters seem cool as opposed to a semi-decent story and narrative.It actually felt like a video game! John would go to meet and find what he needed to do, but then had to do a side quest in order to get the information and enemies needed 3 headshots to be killed, lol.As I said, it was an okay film and a decent action movie, but falls short of the other 3 films.","

Similar to the Mission: Impossible and Fast & Furious franchises, the John Wick series knows what it does best and doubles down on the action, drama, and fight scenes in this fourth installment.Donnie Yen's Caine and Shamier Anderson's Nobody are the perfect counterparts to Keanu Reeves. I wish we were getting a movie with all three of them fighting The High Table. Everyone was raving about ""that stairway scene"" when the movie first came out. I personally thought the poker game, and resulting fight, at Killa Harken's nightclub was my favorite scene.Having said that, the action is some of the best I've seen (Sisu vibes). Reeves continues to dazzle audiences with his combat capabilities. Anderson has a fun arsenal. Yen plays yet another blind man with a deadly weapon. Bill Skarsg√•rd was a good villain but I wish we had more from him.If the franchise continues, I hope they stay as grounded in reality as they can. Some of the lines, characters, and gadgets had a little bit of a Bond feel to them. I don't want the John Wick series to suddenly become about gimmicks and snappy one-liners.Prop I Want: The nunchaku John Wick uses

The three main characters do sound like the start of a bad joke. I'll let you figure that out.I do know that AI didn't write the latest chapter in the John Wick Chronicles, as no self-respecting computer would do such a lousy job.It's as if the producers just copied and pasted the same scene 15 times, borrowing from the previous movies, until they ran out of RAM on the editing machines. There's no original story; Keanu thinks about the paycheck as every CGI 'enhanced' fight scene starts. You can see it in his eyes.And don't mention Kevlar suits. Whoever came up with that concept should be, well, shot. And why do the bad guys all have access to handguns but nothing else?Chapter 4 falls so far short of the first film; it's impressive. It's rumoured Sir Ranulph Fiennes has been called in to find the route back to the original.It is highly polished. There are some great tracks in its armoury. And the overhead shooting in one of the later parts of the film was just enough to keep me watching s I'd not seen it done before.But only just. If I'd paid for the film, I'd ask for my gold coin back.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","stevendbeard","25 March 2023","I saw John Wick: Chapter 4, starring Keanu Reeves-the Matrix movies, Dracula_1992; Donnie Yen-the Ip Man movies, Shanghai Knights; Shamier Anderson-Awake, Wynonna Earp_tv and Bill Skarsgard-the It movies, Atomic Blonde.I love the John Wick movies and they just keep getting better as they go along. The action is off the charts, the stunts are better than ever, and just when you think there is nothing new to see in a fight-or car chase-Baba Yaga will surprise and shock you. Keanu returns for maybe his last ride as John Wick, at least according to how this one wraps things up-but, I'm sure Keanu still has another one or two left in the tank. Bill plays the Marquis, a sort of big shot in the High Table organization that wants Keanu dead. Donnie plays an old friend of Keanu's that Bill forces to hunt Keanu. Shamier is another hired gun that Bill gets to join in on the hunt. Shamier is called the Tracker and has a highly trained dog that tag teams Shamier in fights-on voice commands. All Keanu wants is to get his freedom back and his name cleared. He learns of a loop hole in the High Table rules and focuses all his abilities on reaching that agenda. One of the fight sequences on a flight of stairs is very entertaining and the car chase in Paris is unbelievable-kudos to the stunt people. Make sure you don't leave the theater too soon because there is a scene after the end credits that involves a characters' fate and there is a dedication after that to Lance Reddick-he died March 17 2023-who played the hotel concierge, Charon.It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","eltoro1234","24 June 2023","Don't get me wrong I like John Wick, but this 4th chapter could and should have been wrapped up in under 90 minutes instead of 2hrs 50m!!! The story is good with underworld vibes all played out in beautiful locations and backdrops, it loses its appeal as a movie because it plays out like a triple A computer game, the only difference being there are far less fights and bullets fired in a computer game, the fight scenes should've been far shorter and we'd still have got the gist, think the Bourne movies! Instead we go through scene after scene of moves that would be more at home in Swan Lake and more enjoyable I might add, I swear I can see the actors counting in their moves, 1234 roll 1234 pivot, pivot, pivot (Sorry couldn't help getting a bit of Ross Geller in there).I'm writing this review whilst the movie is running, and we're 25 minutes into what I think is the end of level boss scene, sadly it's all become a little farsical, not only do we have John Wick falling from a 4th floor window to the street below, with a quick shake of the head, he's back to his senses and he's off again, incredible, and all done without a figure hugging body suit emblazoned with JW in sight! We also have a blind samurai sword wielding assassin...I know, not my idea. And throughout the franchise we've been led to believe that John Wick is the greatest hitman of them all, but even the great John Wick with his 20/20 vision is unable to despatch this blind assassin, even failing when equipped with not one but two automatic weapons.I know it's a movie and one should go with the flow, but this is just one chapter of the 4 part (I hope) saga, that we could've done without.Sorry John, but it's time to retire.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","t-muscat8","22 March 2023","John Wick 4 is an incredible addition to the action franchise. The film takes the series to new heights with even more intense fight scenes and a thrilling storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Keanu Reeves delivers another outstanding performance as the iconic hitman, and the supporting cast brings their A-game as well. Without giving away any spoilers, I can confidently say that John Wick 4 exceeds all expectations and is a must-see for fans of the series and action movie lovers alikeit's the best John wick and all of the characters that are added do an amazing job beat villains.","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","rockyandbullwinkle","29 May 2023","The fight scenes tell it all . . . Excruciatingly slow and overly choreographed. The guys he fights move forward and back like rag dolls without any effort on Keanu's part with overly emphasized movements. At one point the guy he was fighting had a gun and just held it limply waiting his turn to get his ass kicked. I saw the nods to the Matrix in a few scenes (the rain scene and the subway scene) which was interesting but I'm telling you the fight scenes were yawnworthy. The storyline was weak too . . . I thought he was going to take on the twelve but not only did he not do that but we are left with almost no knowledge about the 12. I would have liked to do more of a deep dive on that subject . . . Surely we could have investigated that more deeply in the THREE HOURS?? Keanu's movements are also getting too slow and deliberate. In a way I think that's why they ended his story . . . He probably wanted out. It was great to see Laurence Fishburne again since they snubbed him in the last Matrix movie but I would have liked to see more of a deep dive with his character. Overall I give this Mr Wick's swansong a ""C""","

"John Wick: Chapter 4","searchanddestroy-1","25 November 2023","I began the JOHN WICK film series since the beginning but stopped in 2017 or 2019, I don't remember exactly, because it bored me. I love action films, but in those ones, there were too many fights for my taste. Too much action kills action...The sequences are awesome, no problem - despite the 223 rounds of ammo in a 9mm pistol supposed to have only 13 at the most...and Keanu Reeves hit by a car at full speed and getting back in action rightaway - but the main Keanu Reeves' character also annoyed me so much. So I decided to stop going to watch the next films. This third sequel is watched at home, so that I can stop the viewing wheneverI wish to. The feeling is exactly the same, excellent directing, scenery, production design, fight scenes, but I am still bored...The ultimate sequence before the ending credits are surprising though, that's the only reason why I comment it. However, I have alreaddy learned that there would be a fifth film. Oh my God. For me, Keanu Reeves remains and will forever remain POINT BREAK agent Utah. His best performance, as well as his Nemesis in the film: Patrick Swayze.",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4","xmazmy","23 March 2023","I, just like many others, went in with high expectations because of the anticipation of this movie, and amazingly enough, did not disappoint as well as exceeded my expectations!As a newcomer to the John Wick franchise, but having been aware of it for a very long time, I really love these films, particularly the first one. After watching Parabellum, and slightly wondering if the caliber and scope of it can be overtaken, I was gladly mistaken after seeing this film. The IMAX experience was breathtaking and impactful, so if given the opportunity, definitely don't miss out. But, watching it in a regular cinema is also equally good. While I don't want to spoil, I find that the movie felt way shorter than it's 2h 49m runtime, as I felt that Parabellum felt around 20 minutes too long. So if runtime worries you, I can assure you that it is not a problem, but a positive.The movie left me highly satisfied and breathless, so massive props and respect to everyone involved in superseding the other entries and reinvigorating the action genre. It really feels like a once in a lifetime example of a genuinely impactful action movie. Please watch it and I feel that a 10 is worthy simply because of enjoyable nature, which the movie leans into. It does everything an incredible movie needs, and easily makes it one of the best movies as of late, and the apex of this amazing franchise! Also props to Keanu Reeves for inhabiting this character as well, as nobody brings it like him.",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4","karanitsch_stefan","22 April 2023","The movie was simply bad. To much over the top unrealistic action, to a point where it became stupid and to much bad written dialog. I dond know who this movie is for. Waste of time and waste of money. Sad to see, that talent in the film industry seems to continue to decline.The camera shots looked in most of the scenes quite impressive. That is kind of the reason I gave this movie 3/10 stars. Half of the time I was looking on my watch, hoping the movie ends.From the reaction of other people during the movie i got the same expression. Everyone was laughing at action scenes that weren't intended to be funny..",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4","fallyhag","23 May 2023","I enjoyed the first film. 2nd was okay. Loved the dogs in the 3rd. But found this one painfully repetitive.The story was ridiculous. It was parody on steroids. Even the loyal fanboy must be left thinking WTF!? It just rolls from one macho cliche to another not even trying to be a good film. Just lots of pointless fights. CGI blood. Predictable outcomes and plenty of convenient plots.The lighting was wonderful though...But just too many super hero characters that defy science and biology. What is the point of sitting through countless fight scenes when you know they won't be killed? It got so damn repetitive I genuinely lost interest.The sicophants will love it. But those who enjoy a good film will be left head scratching. And yawning.",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4","charliecinco-69550","30 June 2023","Title: John Wick 4: Underwhelming Acting and Unbelievable ShootoutsJohn Wick 4, the latest installment in the franchise, disappoints with its lackluster acting and implausible shootout scenes. Viewers are left frustrated as the main character repeatedly shoots at enemies who inexplicably survive, creating an unrealistic and unsatisfying viewing experience.One of the glaring flaws in John Wick 4 is the subpar acting across the board. Keanu Reeves, known for his stoic portrayal of John Wick, delivers a performance devoid of depth or emotional engagement. His one-note acting fails to captivate the audience and falls short of the expectations set by previous films. The supporting cast also struggles to bring their characters to life, delivering wooden and uninspired performances that do little to enhance the story.The shootout scenes in John Wick 4 are a major letdown. Despite the protagonist's relentless barrage of bullets, none of the enemies seem to succumb to their wounds, regardless of the number of shots fired. The sheer lack of realism in these scenes is frustrating and undermines the film's credibility. It becomes increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief when the basic laws of physics and human vulnerability are disregarded so blatantly.The film attempts to generate tension through close combat scenes, showcasing John Wick shooting his adversaries in vital areas like the head and hips. However, the lack of consequences for these shots is mind-boggling. It defies logic that opponents can endure multiple deadly shots without succumbing to their injuries. This absence of realism drains the action sequences of any stakes or excitement, resulting in repetitive and uninteresting moments.Furthermore, the inconsistent portrayal of characters with extraordinary abilities adds to the film's problems. Without clear explanations or cohesive development, these characters appear arbitrary and confusing. For instance, a scene in which one character is shot while others remain unharmed feels contrived and poorly thought out. It disrupts the already weak narrative and contributes to the overall frustration experienced by the audience.In summary, John Wick 4 falls short in several aspects. The acting performances lack depth and fail to engage the viewers emotionally. The shootout scenes, where enemies survive an unrealistic number of bullets, undermine the film's credibility and leave audiences unsatisfied. The absence of consequences for vital shots further diminishes the tension and excitement. Moreover, the inconsistent portrayal of characters with extraordinary abilities adds confusion to an already weak narrative. Overall, John Wick 4 is a disappointing entry in the franchise, offering underwhelming acting and unbelievable shootout sequences.",NA
