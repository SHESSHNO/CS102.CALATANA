"MiroslavKyuranov","31 May 2023","It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.","

"UniqueParticle","2 June 2023","The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.","

"pugpool10","2 June 2023","If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.","

"rickothan","2 June 2023","This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.","

"hectorvernet","31 May 2023","First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.","

"cricketbat","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","11 June 2023","It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.","

"nickryan-44535","6 June 2023","Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.","

"JayWolfgramm","11 June 2023","I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.","

"planktonrules","21 June 2023","""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" currently has an astounding overall rating of 9.0. Like many other incredibly high ranked movies, I'm sure over time the score will drop but given it's so high now, I cannot imagine it leveling off below 8.0...meaning it's one of the best rated movies of all time. Well, while it might be a great crowd-pleaser, I am writing a dissenting review....and if you are like me, you might not be as bowled over as most reviewers.To put things in perspective, I am 59 years-old and certainly NOT in the target audience....so keep this in mind. While I like an occasional superhero film, I also don't adore them...but I did think the previous Spider-Man film, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"" was one of the best of its genre. In fact, I gave it a 10...I was that impressed with its originality and story and animation. So why was I left colder by its sequel? Well, there are several reasons. First, if you are like me and not all that familiar with Spider-Man, you'll probably find much of the story confusing...unlike the previous film. Second, the artwork, while very original, made my brain hurt! It was LOUD and BRASH and really awful...at least to me. The worst part was that the backgrounds actually looked like I was watching a 3-D movie WITHOUT 3-D glasses! Uggh...it was an assault on my eyes. And, third, I hated how the film ended with no plot resolution whatsoever....none.So does all this mean I hated the film? No. I laughed quite a few times...and mostly when it introduced other alternate universe Spider-creatures (many are women or animals...not just Spider-MEN). I also thought the basic story, once you strip away the horribly fast edits and garish artwork, was very interesting. Overall, not a bad film but I just did not particularly enjoy it nor do I particularly need to see the third and final film in the series.","

"DeadMansTrousers","14 June 2023","I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.","

"rgkarim","2 June 2023","LIKES:The Pace For The Most Part
-Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.The Voice Acting
-Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.The Storytelling
-There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.The Comedy To A degree
-I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs
-Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.The Action Scenes
-A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.The Animation/Art Style
-You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.DISLIKES:The Comedy A Bit Too Forced
-There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.Some Pacing Offsets
-There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.-At least until the need.The Ending 20 minutes for me
-The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.The Sound Quality With Some Characters
-It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.The VERDICT:
Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5.","

"sfarrow8","2 June 2023","I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :THE ARTWORK.This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW.","

"penelopemmorris","8 June 2023","I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!","

"jenkinscammy","7 June 2023","Takes itself way too seriously, and fails to tell a compelling story.The writers apparently tried to re-use the formula for the first Spider-Verse movie, at the expense of character growth.This movie has a cliff-hanger ending, meaning that it's really just half of a movie. It hurts the pacing.The action is very predictable, but at the same time, the story is unnecessarily complicated. There's never any fear that any of the main characters are in danger.Overall, it's missing the wholesome, lighthearted moments which were so endearing in the first movie. This is a good movie to skip in the theaters and catch on streaming/DVD.","

I felt like I was traveling from the multiverse to my childhood back in 2002 when I saw Tobey maguire Spider-Man 21 years ago when I was 7 years old. And seeing all the other spider people including Spider-cat and Spider-rex . The spot traveling to venoms universe was absolutely hilarious. I hope to see ultimate Spider-Man from the video game I never finished on GameCube or Xbox for almost 17 years since I was a kid. Seeing 2018 Spider-Man from the PS4 game was very outstanding. I hope in Spider-Man beyond the spiderverse meets Tobey maguire and miles teams up with him and he helps him build the device and Gwen meets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and they help build the same device to bring miles home .","

"FeastMode","2 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete. Instead of exciting escalation to a beastly climax, in the last half hour we get setup.(2 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 6/1/2023, UltraScreen 6/7/2023)","

"TheBigSick","10 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel to the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The film is plagued by pacing issues, a reliance on clichés, and a lack of focus.The film's biggest problem is its length. At two hours and twenty minutes, it feels like two movies crammed into one. The first half of the film is slow and meandering, with too many subplots that don't really go anywhere. The second half of the film is much better, but it still feels rushed.Another issue with the film is its reliance on clichés. The theme of family is particularly overused, and it doesn't really add anything new to the story. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling too short.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor.","

"pressboard","15 June 2023","I generally liked the animation but it constantly reminded me of trying to watch a 3D movie without the 3D glasses. The petty drama is endless and becomes old fast. There are loads of action scenes that immediately devolve into slow soap opera drama. My wife and I kept nodding off during these whine-a-thones which seemed very contrived. I did like all of the iterations of spider flavors in the Spiderverse which were endlessly creative and entertaining. The music always suggests exciting action scenes but this becomes a little exhausting after the 4th or 5th wind up. Long winded exposition seems necessary to spoon feed a very lengthy and convoluted plot. When I booked I noticed the theater was sold out but we left before the end and noticed that only 10 members of the audience still remained having left before us. Spot was a good albeit comedic villain. I would suggest going just for the animation and humor even with the 140min run time.","

"daralad","18 June 2023","I loved into the spiderverse, it had great animation, great characters, great plot development and great music. There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time.","

"srdjankostic91","31 May 2023","I rarely write reviews, but this movie is truly exceptional. It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.The story is exceptionally well-crafted, expanding upon the existing characters while introducing new ones and incorporating intriguing twists. The humor throughout the film is spot-on, providing moments of levity without undermining the emotional depth of the narrative.Just go and see it!","

"georgetbarber","2 June 2023","Adjusted rating - 8.5/10: a genuine spectacle, you could take thousands of shots from this movie and turn them into posters, it's beautiful to look at. I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.Real rating - 7/10: it's half a movie man!! It's a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don't get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would've been better suited to a series format - it's already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn't work with the first movie and it wouldn't make as much money. To make it a great movie they should've dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it.","

"martimusross","27 August 2023","Spider-Man - Across the Spider verseI am at a loss to understand the high scores on this movie, it was tedious in the extreme, we had no proper story, all that remained was emotions, feelings and a whole array of woke tropes. The one thing that is central to the Spider-man comics is a good strong story and nearly every film reflects this need, here it was missing.The graphics were very weird and at times just looked half finished, it was very much style over substance, Disney/Pixar would have realised this so we, the viewer, remain focused on the story and not the artwork. Animation must not be the star of the show, it is merely a vehicle in telling a story, even in Tron, animation at its most extreme, served to tell the story.With had scene after scene of breathless freneticism, I was quite frankly bored, this amounts to ""meat and no bones"", you just cannot sustain a movie on action alone, you observe in Rocky or Mission Impossible how all the action sequences are balanced with other elements.I really can't see why this movie was made and who was the target audience, I am a life long fan of Spider-Man, and this left me cold as it had just nothing for the fans, and it totally lacked any humour which is key.I'm giving this 2 outta 10 to my mind it was a disaster.","

"matris1","3 June 2023","The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respects and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (hard to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.Should you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man (both on and off screen) while offering something new. It's also just a brilliantly made animated film. Highly recommended.","

"mrbledsoe53","3 June 2023","As visually stunning and groundbreaking of the animation, unfortunately, it was too much to take. I'm in my early 40s so younger viewers probably won't be affected as much. Didn't have an issue with Into the Spider-verse, but apparently, they increased the intensity to the point that I left with a headache. The different frame rates of characters in the same scene, the visual distortion in the background at times, made it difficult to focus and was basically visual overstimulation. I enjoyed the story and would like to see Beyond the Spider-verse but may have to just read about it if the animation is as intense as this film.","

"ayoreinf","4 June 2023","I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.They didn't give up on anything; didn't allow a single detail to go amiss. They wouldn't give up on any bit of storytelling. It's all there, no matter how long the final cut will be, and still, it's not too long not even a second too long. The characters are all fully developed - real human beings drawn in comics form, but human just like any of us watching them on screen. It calls for some of the best voice acing I've seen, by each and every member of the cast. I simply can't single out anyone of them. They were all superb.And than the story itself - It's way more than just sci-fi comics. It doesn't limit itself to the usual issues of power and its moral implications. It's asking us the deep questions of what determines the path our life take? Are we ruled by our destiny? Is it all written in our stars? If I had a problem with most of the comics I read it was because of the fatalistic approach adopted by most of them. This one defies the tradition in the best way. It breaks down all the accepted rules and leaves us all hanging in one of the best cliff hangers ever.If you love comics, science fiction, action movies or simply real brilliant cinema - go see it.","

"Ruben17","31 May 2023","This is whiteout a doubt peak Spider-Man and even peak cinema!Every scene in this animation movie was as good as perfect! The coloring, animation, character designs, music and the way they used the Spider humor was so funny and well timed!Bonding with character hasn't been as easy as it is here, they really explore the backgrounds of the different characters so emotional and passionately at the same time.It's a necessary darker & more emotional storyline for the characters but that's just how Peter Parkers storyline is...
It's a 2h20 movie but there wasn't one scene that I would've left out, I would've even preferred for it to go at almost 3h cause I wasn't a huge fan of the ending! You'll know when seeing it!There are so many Easter eggs & Spider-man's it to crazy for words!What more can i say than this is a masterpiece and probably the best Spider-Man movie to date!","

I found it sort of stupid that in a world of Spider-Man, not one Spider-Man could catch Morales. Just found it odd. You watch a whole movie to get a Clift hanger. Which wasn't that great. I felt like we were missing a big climax that never happened. I found the characters in the first movie more funny. They sort of tried too hard on this one. The cgi comic book art is cool. I find it distracting at times and it takes away from the emotions. I don't know I just had higher expectations from what reviews were saying.","

This movie is like you when say you like a song, so they play the same song twice as loud hoping you love it twice as much. It more disjointed, the emotions get lost, and really, the ending? In 2 hours and 16 minutes you can bring this movie to at least a temporary conclusion? The villain does not have a good enough back story to carry one, much less two movies. That said some of the spiderverses we see were very creative (especially India-Manhattan mix), and the lead character is as always very likeable. It's like they really didn't much else to say, and then they take too long to say what they did.","

"CinemaSerf","4 June 2023","Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it's also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you'd expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey's seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it's moments - assuming you can catch it - and there's a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole ""multiverse"" theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I'm not sure I'll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for ""Miles"" and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.","

"ibarix","7 October 2023","The animations are fantastic. Something between 3D, comics and animated film. Other... Where to start? 2.5 hours of a festival of colors and chaos. The film seems to have been made by someone with serious ADHD while on LSD. There is rarely a pause between sentences to process what has been heard. Combined with the cluttered animations, I had the impression that I was watching the movie at 1.5x speed. It can be seen that the film is totally adapted to new generations. Parents are friends instead of being parents, they use slang, everything is colorful, fast and ""adapted"" to short attention spans. There is no tension, the dialogues just flow without much expressiveness or meaning. There is more drama than action. Once again, the animations and style are absolutely phenomenal. The level of dialogues, scripts and everything else is not at the level of animations. The movie had to be at least half an hour shorter with a better story, less woke crap and far more suspense. This gives the impression that it is a Coca Cola advertisement. Due to excessive animations and hasty speech, the film is difficult to follow for long periods of time. A good idea, but the execution (except for the animations) is average at best.","

"HabibieHakim123","12 June 2023","Best Spider-Man movie ever???, more of like the worst Spider-Man movie i've ever watched, Across The Spider-Verse is indeed fits with the title, it's basically a set up movie for the big finale/battle for the next movie, this movie is just the middle of it, i have so many problem with the film from it being too incredibly long, incredibly slow, and incredibly quiet, i don't know if it's just my theater that the volume of the movie was low but it's just not right, the slowness of the narrative and pacing really bothering me, even the dialogue was so slow that the quiet distance between each line i can hear couple people snoring because how so empty the film is, how boring the movie is, and i'm not blaming them at all, it fills with so many unnecessary long slow scene, the soundtrack was bad and compare to the fire soundtrack of the previous movie there is zero memorable song, the voice acting pissed me off too because how they talk mostly so quitely and so whispery and it also sounds mostly like they have no emotion at all, Across The Spider-Verse is missing a lot of the key part including the OG team with Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker, etc. And i miss the depressed Peter B. Parker and in here he's having a perfect life which is good but not as fun and as engaging of a character anymore, the side villain of this movie was Miguel as Spider-Man 2099 and it didn't work as he was not as cool or as menacing as i expected, so do The Spot unfortunately, the positive was of course the animation was still great, i like both Spider-Man India and Spider-Punk, the action was decent, wasn't really blown away by it, it's quite entertaining, the cameos are fine, but the obvious cameos was very disappointing for me, anyway, Across The Spider-Verse for me was a bad example of a set up movie, a set up movie shouldn't be this long except if you fill it with a boring long narrative that fills with so many unnecessary long slow scene with bland and weak story, weak voice acting, and wrong decisions like this one, Across The Spider-Verse is bad, it's a failure, it's a complete waste of time and it could not be a waste of time if it's execute properly with the runtime, the content, and the story, it could be a less than 2 hours movie of a set up instead of more 30 plus minutes of unnecessary boring content, Into The Spider-Verse was a triumph while Across The Spider-Verse was a blunder, and i have my reason and that's the most important.","

I'd probably put it 7th on the list of Spider-Man movies.The positive:Gwen was probably the best part of the movie. They did a great job with her and she is probably as much the lead in this movie as Miles. Her action scenes were great and her character was likable.Miles character was also very well done and it was nice to see his character progress and mature from the last one. I'm a Peter Parker guy but there is definitely room for Miles.I thought the Spot, who is usually a lame villain, was pretty cool. I liked the character arc and progression they gave him.Miguel was a decent character. I'm hoping there is more character development in Pt 2 because he just comes off like an angry jerk the entire movie.The action scenes were well done and all the cameos were a lot of fun and the final twist at the end was fantasticThe negative:It was about 45 minutes too long. I miss the sub 2 hr movie. My youngest was bored to tears before the midway point.They totally neutered Peter B Parker, who was the best part of the first movie. They made him a complete buffoon.The animation was a bit much at times. It was headache inducing.Hobart was cool when you could understand what he was saying. It was like listening to a Gallagher brother voicing a Spider-Man character..I hated every scene that Spider-Woman was in. She was easily the worst out of all the main characters in the movie.","

"hobgoblinlol","8 August 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is a good film, better than the first one for sure but not something that should have 8.9 rating. I'm mixed about the animation, some things look really great but the other half is nauseating. I really didn't like the phasing, the movie is more than 2 hours long and it feels like the chase scene in the multiverse takes 1/3 of the film. The Spot is a fun villain but still don't get how he suddenly goes from wanting to rob an ATM machine to wanting to destroy the entire world, don't like how he just disappeared for the rest of the film. Miguel was fun even though his backstory was also really generic. Across the Spider-Verse is a good movie, but it relies on flashy animation and fanservice to cover up it's flaws. For example, am I the only one not ok with classic Peter Parker bringing his daughter to extremely dangerous places? Or with Spider-Woman getting slammed to a train while being pregnant? Also, too many Spider-Mans are just a parody of themselves. Don't get me started with awful modern humor. Overall, the sequel is better than the first film, but even more overrated. Flawed plot, great animation, ok soundtrack, fun action, too much fanservice.","

"jimmystz","8 June 2023","Its not bad, it just doesn't fill the shoes.The movie is caught up in doing a bad impression of the original but misses the small details and cleverness that made the original a hit.So much of the plot and dialog is flat. The surprises didn't surprise me. I barely noticed them. The jokes where uninspired. I think I laughed once. The stakes where much higher but the tension felt much lower.Its worse in the technical aspects as well. Sound design, Pacing, Art Direction, Character Depth and Development all worse. Technically Across the Spider-Verse has a deeper world but not much of it was not memorable. I felt like the movie took a long time to say and show very little where the original did the complete opposite.When the squeal was announced and I heard they had different directors I raised an eyebrow. I lightly considered that team to be miracle workers. Unfortunately the concerns seem proven. The current Directing team says they're done after the second act of Across the Spider-Verse.I know a colossal amount of time, energy and love went into this movie and I'm scorching it. Squeals are notoriously hard to balance. They are often caught between what the original was and what so many people imagine that it should have/ could have been. Squeals sometimes they get tangled trying to be an unnecessary correction.Despite all these criticisms its still a good movie. There was a lot to appreciate. It was fun and characters will make you feel something. The best parts of the movie where all around the Parents of the many Spider-Verses. They tried to make the importance of family the core but that is difficult in an action movie were the hero's are living split secrete lives. Holding out hope for the next one.","

"shanayneigh","27 August 2023","Remember when people were able to tell a story in two hours or less? When stories had a beginning, middle and an end? When the number one priority wasn't to build a never ending franchise, but to simply tell a story?I liked Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) which I thought was surprisingly good.Please, give the whole multiverse schtick a rest. Sure, it offers the great (merchandising) opportunity to include a zillion versions of Spiderman, but it also reduces the stakes to absolutely nothing.In the first half of the movie they establish the new main bad guy (or so one would think) whose backstory is a ridiculous throwaway gag by one of the animators of the first movie. After an hour or so the new bad guy vanishes from the movie. As we get closer to the end I look at my watch thinking ""There's no way they'll wrap this up in the ten minutes that are left"". And of course they don't, since their priority isn't to tell a coherent story, but to build a franchise. So we're left hanging with no resolution. If we want one, we'll have to pay for the next movie too! Genius film making.Of course it was 20-30 minutes too long as per usual for comic book movies today. And this is only the first installment! Including the sequel (or rather, the third act of this movie) this simple story will probably be about an hour longer than Gone With The Wind. Amazing.I watched this movie on a huge screen in Tokyo. The visuals were grating. The dotted areas and the double/triple outlines, which I suppose are meant to emulate early printing techniques of shadows/gradients and out-of-focus areas did not look good on the big screen. The first movie employed the same visual style, although not as pronounced as in this sequel. On a small screen (like my 65 inch OLED at home) they were not an issue. But on a huge cinema screen they were making my eyes bleed.There is no way I'll pay to see the third one.","

"trinaboice","1 November 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
This is only Part 1 of a two-part sequel. Sweet! Fans are thrilled, rewarding the movie with $221 million at the worldwide opening. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, a truly magical team.Writing credits go to Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and David Callaham. The story is about Miles Morales who catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.THINGS I LIKED:
The animation is colorful, energetic, and impressively expressive. It combines classic comic book design with modern-day CGI for a thrilling effect. Each frame looks like it came straight out of a moving comic book. Fans are completely nerding out!The cast of voice talents includes Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, Brian Tyree Henry, J. K. Simmons, Luna Lauren Velez, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch, Jorma Taccone, Karan Soni, and Shea Whigham.The script is extremely inventive, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time.We get some creative villains that come from various multiverses.Lots and lots of action!The movie takes place across 6 dimensions with 240 characters in it and over 1,000 animators working on it! It's the largest crew of any animated movie ever made!So many Easter eggs. They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics. Wow.This is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything. Scratch that...two or three times! The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can't see it all.I've never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material.I got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man. Haha
I've always loved animated movies that include live-action characters.The cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment.Surprising twists caught me off guard. Sweet.There is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual.I've just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days! His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience. The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash. It's another fun adventure into the metaverse!You can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you'll understand and appreciate it even more if you have.If you love Hailee Steinfeld's character of Gwen Stacey, you'll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some viewers and fans will be annoyed that the movie doesn't actually end at the end and they'll have to wait an entire year to see the rest of the story. Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-verse is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024.Some of the action scenes are chaotic and happen so fast that you don't have time to really savor the moment.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is not just some random kids' movie. It's very mature and filled with humor and insights that adults can enjoy.Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles.!","

I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!It's time for everyone to appreciate animation as a veritable film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly shows that you just can't do in a live-action movie what you can do with animation. I 100% think that the richness of emotions this masterpiece conveys was greatly benefited by the animation and its mesmerizing style. Just see it and you'll agree!","

"alindsayal","21 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse was one of my favourite comic book films ever, and after all these years the sequel, Across The Spider-Verse has been released and I have finally had a chance to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Miles Morales travel across the multiverse where he meets other Spider-Men that at are charged with protecting it, Miles must understand what it takes to be a true hero.Main Character
Shameik Moore is back as Miles Morales and he is fantastic. He plays the teenage spider-man very well and he is easily likeable which is great to see. There is more to him though, Moore adds real emotion to the story of Morales and the things he goes through is well done. Gwen Stacy voiced by Hailee Steinfeld gets way more to do in this film and I would argue her character is as important as Miles. She gives such an emotional performance and Gwen is a character that we learn a lot about and see how she really fits into this story. The dynamic between both characters is really well delivered and I am glad it worked so well.Supporting Characters
This film has probably the most amount of characters a film ever has, so I certainly won't be going through all of them but I will acknowledge that they are all great.Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Velez return as Miles parents and they are a large part of this story. Seeing how the dynamic between Miles and his parents goes down is a really crucial element of this film and the two performers did a great job.Oscar Isaac plays Miguel O'Hara and is fantastic. It seems like he is becoming the king of comic book films and shows and he is no different here, O'Hara is the leader of the team of Spider-Men and he is the most serious character in this film. As you learn more about him, you understand why he does what he does and it makes him a really interesting character.Jake Johnson is back as Peter B Parker, though he has a much smaller role. Even though he isn't in the film a huge amount he is used effectively and I felt like he was somebody that added to the overall story of the film and how it affects Miles life.There are some other great characters specifically Jason Schwartzman as The Spot, Issa Rae as Jessica Drew and Daniel Kaluuya as Spider-Punk. They all were fun additions to the cast here.Story
The story is fantastic. As I mentioned above, it focuses equally on Miles Morales & Gwen Stacy and it deals with both stories incredibly well. This film exceeds what the majority of people would expect for an animated film with the amount of depth and emotion that goes ahead with these characters and the situations that they are put in. This is also a great ending, which feels appropriate for the film and effects every character that has been a spotlight of the film.Script
The script is really great. The comedy is well written, this film is funny and not in a childish way. It is clever with its comedy and it picks appropriate times to use it. But the drama is where the film succeeds, you really do care about these characters and how the events in the film change the characters.Style
The first film was amazing to look at and so creative in its design. This film is even better, you can't take your eyes off the screen because of the colours and use of technical devices that no ever film does like it. This films pacing is great too, it clearly has different acts to the film and I was never bored,Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is an Epic film that just like its predecessor is one of the best comic book films ever made. Ignore the fact that it is an animated film, this is an amazing film and especially for Spider-Man films needs to be see.Rating - 10/10.","

"will-howlett","2 June 2023","I loved loads about this film, mainly the amazing action sequences and the sweet sweet fan service (one bit of fan service got a big loud oooooh from myself and most of the cinema).The problem I had with it is that despite it being a 2 parter so much of the emotional exposition was stretched out far longer than necessary through overlong dialogue. About an hour of the film is dedicated to ensuring we understand that Miles is a young man finding his path through life (I have no idea how some of the younger kids in the audience sat through it, they must have just been mesmerised by the flashy colours). It could have been handled in a much more condensed manner by better writers and still had the required impact. Given the film ends at a point that feels like a natural final third act it left me feeling shortchanged.If the overlong dialogue scenes had been condensed then I believe there would have been no need for the 2 parter. But then people wouldn't pay to see 2 films instead of 1.I expect when the initial mega fan reaction dies down and more ordinary filmgoers leave shocked at the ""to be continued"" message the IMDb score will dip dramatically.","

"monuthube","1 July 2023","Yeah, watched it finally. I mean seriously, I'm following a lot of industry artists (intentionally) on Insta and LinkedIn. And I started getting the posts of artists who were involved in making this film, and the day it was officially released, all my Insta and LinkedIn feeds flooded with behind-the-scenes shots that artists worked on. My god, it freaking huge... Every morning I opened Insta or LinkedIn, there were artist posts everywhere and it happened for 3-4 days 😱. Then there I read the news that this movie had the highest number of production crews both 3D & 2D, working simultaneously 🤐.Looks like I need to update my favorite animated movie list, previously it was 'Into the Spider-verse', because of the story, animation, and music. Post Malone's Sunflower is still my phone ringtone for 5 years, which reminds me of the movie which is special to me and now definitely, it's 'Across the Spider-verse'. But, still, wait for it, this was just part 1 of a full sequel story... I'm super-damn-excited for 'Beyond the Spider-verse'.This time I watched the movie in the theatre, aka big screen. So, imagine how it was, the cityscape, duh and the conversion of Gwen and Miles, at the same time, this is what the best composition is! That whole scene was romantic and breathtaking. It's just too huge to save at once in my brain. And what the hell, the story, it's just so beautiful with the background music, it's still not high as the first movie (for me) but still it's best than any other which builds the moments you fall in love and become part of the story. Other than Miles and Gwen, Oscar Isaac's Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 is a totally different highlight of the movie, his presence sets the tense and wild mood in every scene. I mean second half is where the movie gets high on adrenaline rush, the wildness of Miguel O'Hara and the background music, sets everything on fire. And wait, if you imagine this as a complete movie then let me tell you as per story structure it was just the middle part (2nd act of 3 Act story structure), the real climax is yet to be witnessed in 'Beyond the Spider-verse'. The end part of the movie... Ho-oh, that was damn-freaking tense and unexpected (I mean it was not that difficult to guess) but I figured out the problem, that everyone faces in the multiversal stories concepts, is just that min blowing. But the way it was built up to this was like, something unbelievable.Talking about animation, I don't need to tell you... you just need to watch this movie because this is the peak of animation (I think so), how can we measure the creativity? Every single world and character had a different art style, imagine it... How crazy can creativity can go. I loved Gwen's world which had an art style of watercolors, it changed with the mood of the story and that was just another level of beauty.I personally enjoyed this movie deep down to my heart, because it just so f*kn' from all sides, its story is amazing, the animation is at just a different level, and dialogues-drama is beautiful. The reference to pop-cultural and real-life references, I mean when did you laugh openly (deep from your heart) while watching the movie? I mean it was a total roller coaster ride, from happy-joyful moments to sad-tensed moments. And Gwen & Miles's romance is just so beautiful with that cityscape, you'll fall in love with the movie. And another thing that stands out is the scene composition, I mean really every scene is so f*kn' beautiful, I can't just process it (it happened to me while watching Avatar: Way of Water), I say this is as eyes getting orgasm.The thing is, Miles's character is so relatable to youngsters like us, that you understand his pov. I just wish not to cut the movie here, I mean it could have been more better if part two was added to this aka making it a 4-hour movie, and Gwen's taking the lead in the end was another best thing (from scene composition pov). There are so many things I want to talk about because I'm in love with this movie.I definitely-x-infinity will recommend this movie, to see what the best-est animated movie looks like, there are literally no flaws. It's all-round PERFECT in a big-bold, movie.If you hadn't watched the 'Into the Spider-verse' then start from there it's available on both Netflix and Amazon, then if possible enjoy 'Across the Spider-verse' on a big screen, just to feel the quality of the scenes.","

"lauralewis-48859","23 June 2023","These movies are spectacular. I loved the first one and thought there was no way they could make the second one as good. It is as good or even better!! It is engaging and funny. It has such a good plot and storyline. The characters are wonderfully developed. The spot is a really cool villain and the twist at end is wow! Beside all of this, the visuals are phenomenal. It's an experience to watch it. I can't imagine the amount of talent that went into making this movie. I saw this in the movie theater and I cannot wait to rewatch it when it starts streaming. My 7 year old loves it as much as me.","

"michvanbeek","10 August 2023","Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse dates back to 2018. The film was received extremely positively by friend and foe and rightly so. And such an animated film with a sublime animation style was something that had never been seen before on this scale. Like going to a comic book that was translated on screen and with a very, very good story. It may take five years for the sequel, but patience pays off and how. It seemed a fairly tough task in advance to be able to surpass Into the Spider-Verse, but this has absolutely succeeded in every area. Where the regular Marvel movies have fallen into disrepair, where the quality of those movies has gone up and down, the Spider-Verse movies are definitely not and maybe it's better for Marvel to focus on these gems than again for the umpteenth time to bring some weak and much too expensive live action film into the cinemas that are destroyed by the media and the public.The story is enriched by deepening the backgrounds of, for example, Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales and that really works out perfectly. Why mention Gwen first? That's simple, the story around Gwen really worked out best in this movie. The opening of the movie might make you think ok, I hope it really gets a lot better than this, but this feeling will go away very soon. The origin of Spider-Man's enemy Spot is beautifully worked out. At first it seems like a funny and above all clumsy figure who has absolutely no control over his powers. When it finally becomes clear who Spot is and what his ultimate intentions are, Gwen comes back into the picture with Miles, but it is not yet clear why. Until Miles finds out that all universes are connected and that Gwen turns out to be a key that brings Miles to the Spider-people, led by Miguel O'Hara. This all sounds very dull, but the story seems to have a really hypnotic effect and that is where the strength of the film lies.With a running time of almost two and a half hours, it might stop people from taking a quick look at the film, but the running time is justified. Where Into the Spider-Verse still felt like the best, which strangely enough was still kept under two hours, that is really different with this film. With Into the Spider-Verse it was in a chaotic and almost impossible to follow color explosion called the ending. This is really different in Across the Spider-Verse. The entire film is expertly worked out, with the story only leaving you wanting more. Obviously this is because the open ending is just a cutoff in the middle of the story, but that's not the only thing. The coming together of every Spider-Man in history and more also builds up to more than just confronting Spot. Of course we could dedicate an entire review to how beautiful the animation is, but this was of course already very clear after the first part. The different animation styles are mixed in this film with a number of other surprises that not only bring you to the drawn or animated Spider-Man, but much more.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse surpasses its predecessor in every way and raises the bar for a sequel. Not only the animation is fantastic, but also the story is perfectly worked out. Perhaps with Across the Spider-Verse we had the best Spider-Man movie yet and that really promises something for the sequel. It is especially the depths of Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales that add considerable force to the film. The threat coming from enemy Spot is really good and the part where Miles joins the Spider-people is really well done. The playing time of almost two and a half hours is strangely enough still a bit on the short side, but good. That is not surprising in this case, because the film ends in the middle of the story, so there is still plenty to do. The movie has been in theaters for a while and for those who haven't seen the movie in theaters yet, do yourself a favor and just go there.","

"dburris-45933","4 June 2023","It's not very often we get an animation film like this...The art is astounding, colorful visuals, a jaw dropping movie phenomenon. The score and songs flow very well, the acting is on par with new additional characters involved...Some we may know, and some we haven't seen on screen yet. The plot of the story is well thought out. Has its silly moments without taking away the essence of the story. Has a very dark tone. This is a movie is aimed not only for children but for comic fans and adults alike. They really achieved movie history and everyone involved did a stiller job! One of the best Spider-Man movies thus far!","

"shoebsaad","5 July 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings back onto the big screen with a stunning sequel that pushes the boundaries of animation and delivers a thrilling and heartfelt story. Picking up where its predecessor left off, this film takes audiences on an exhilarating journey through alternate dimensions, introducing new characters and exploring the multiverse in all its mind-bending glory.Visually, Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece. The unique animation style that made the first film so groundbreaking is taken to even greater heights, with vibrant colors, inventive designs, and seamless blending of various art styles. Each frame is a work of art, immersing viewers in a kaleidoscope of visual splendor that is unlike anything seen in animated films before.But it's not just the visuals that make this film exceptional. The storytelling is equally compelling. The plot follows Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) as he embarks on a new adventure that takes him across different dimensions, encountering various versions of Spider-Man along the way. The narrative deftly balances action, humor, and heartfelt moments, exploring themes of identity, responsibility, and the interconnectedness of the Spider-Verse.The voice cast delivers outstanding performances, bringing their characters to life with depth and authenticity. Shameik Moore once again shines as Miles Morales, capturing the character's youthful energy and growth. The chemistry between the different Spider-People is palpable, creating a sense of camaraderie and unity that is inspiring.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to captivate both younger and older audiences. It seamlessly weaves together a multilayered story that appeals to comic book aficionados while maintaining a universal appeal that draws in casual viewers. Whether you're a die-hard Spider-Man fan or new to the character, the film's narrative and characters will resonate on multiple levels.Additionally, the soundtrack is a standout feature of the movie. With an eclectic mix of genres and tracks, it perfectly complements the film's energy and emotional beats, enhancing the overall experience.If there is any drawback to Across the Spider-Verse, it is that we have to wait for the second part of the story. The film leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the continuation of the adventure, which is a testament to its ability to engage and captivate.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a remarkable sequel that pushes the boundaries of animation while delivering a compelling and emotionally resonant story. With its breathtaking visuals, stellar voice cast, and intelligent storytelling, it solidifies itself as a standout entry in the Spider-Man franchise.

"RogerRoger77","11 June 2023","Ok, my title is deliberately snarky, but ...Like the first movie, the animation here is spectacular. Plus, there are lots of incidental pleasures, mainly seeing all the different Spidermen and their crazy powers and costumes.However, I just wasn't that taken with the characters and plot. Maybe I'm too old for these sorts of films, but do we really need scene after scene of whiny teenagers talking about their feelings? Personally, all I really want from a Spiderman movie is some fun web action and a few zingy one liners. And a more interesting villain than the one we got here.Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I always thought the point of superheroes was to be focused on others - saving the world and all that - not endlessly dissecting their own emotions and obsessing about their families and relationships. Guess this just reflects the world we live in: a Spiderman movie for the me, me, me generation.","

"safayet_shawon","10 August 2023","Just watched the movie yesterday (and rewind the last 30 minutes or so several times!).Very few times in multiple film industry's history, the sequel surpassed its predecessors. ""Into the spider-verse"" put itself in such height with every possible parameters like story-line, character buildup, animation style etc and of course the music!Before watching ""across the spider-verse"", I was confident that, this one will at most come close to the first one, AT MOST...
But boy, was I wrong!! Without leaking any (probably!) spoilers, I'll say just this one thing. I watched about 4/5k movies plus TV shows at least. And I never gladly accepted a show/ movie which ended with a cliffhanger, actually hated them. But this one will remain the SINGULAR exception. And I'll be eagerly waiting for ""beyond the spider-verse"".And the last two songs (self love and am I dreaming) hit really hard, specially after watching the movie at one go. Been listening these two songs the whole day (before, after and even during the office time!)","

"ha77y73ad97","2 August 2023","There are very few sequels that come to mind that outperform the original in every way, this one certainly does. Not falling into the trap of bigger is better and throwing uncessercary cameos, fan service and budget at a series that was on a very strong footing. Everything in this movie had a purpose as apart of a trilogy.When they did announce that there was going to be a sequel to Into the Spider-verse I was unsure as that ended in a very finite way almost a cash grab from Sony on the back of the first one. I will eat my words that i was wrong, they seem as though they knew where they wanted both this and 3rd installments to end. The story of where this ended was a prefect place and i truly hope that there are screenings for both the 2nd and 3rd when new installment is released.One of the greatest leap forwards that has come from these 2 movies so far is that the animation is on another level artistically wise. Each of the Spider-men has their own unique style, as there have been tones of response over Spider-Punk and is way of being animated is a stroke of genius. Gwen Staceys world bring ripped straight from the panels of a comic with the watercolour emotion changing backgrounds even down to the last universe they visit. That cannot be understated as one of the best designed worlds in the series, as we are going to pick up from that we are going to be in for a visual treat.The cast yet again is stacked and the team behind the first have certainly built upon adding new actors to the roster and Oscar Issacs is a stand out as always. The Anti-Hero Spider-man is a tough character to take on. Played to perfection! Scary yet sombar, violent yet compassionate and down to his back story these are going to touge at the heart strings to then be hating him for the actions that he takes.As a second chapter in a 3 part story this is a marvel (pardon the pun) ends with everyone wanting more as a true story should. As mentioning before this goes into that very exclusive category along with T2: judgement day, The Two Towers and a personal favourite Sherk 2 to name just a few!","

I have never seen a sequel so good, I honestly think it was better then the first film. The movie is beautifully constructed. The art work is phenomenal and story is extremely interesting. It has everything in a movie that you could ask for and its great for all audiences. There is no agenda being pushed, or political message trying to be told, instead its just a good old fashion movie with a ton of fun, action and adventure, great family values and innocent love. It has the perfect balance of everything. The art work is stunning. And the story is captivating. I could honestly sit and watch this movie over and over again.","

"ykjdh","2 June 2023","This might possibly be one of the best movies I've seen all year. I'll definitely put it in my top two for the year. The comics look better in animation in my opinion and the design of this super man looked great in IMAX.If there's anything to complain about, it might be the running time which with previews ran around 2hrs and 25 min. Like a lot of good action movies thought it seem to go by pretty fast. The movie doesn't drag and does a good job with its pacing.This time around Miles Morales finds his spdey going across dimensions to save the universe. I'm not revealing any spoilers but let's just say for the fans of the comics, this one stays true to the material. The soundtrack isn't bad either and helps with the pacing. Above all this is one super hero done right. Recommend you see it on the largest screen you can find. Maybe even the drive in.","

The art style blew me away in the first one and it's pretty good here but not good enough for a free pass. I don't know why they had to make it so long for it to end on a ""TBC"". For me it sums up how I feel about this movie that I don't even care how this finishes, sure I'll probably watch the sequel at some point on a Sunday afternoon. The villain is hardly in the movie and it's just expecting me to sit back and enjoy the various settings and characters, which if this was the first film in this style would be enough. Glad I didn't fall for the hype and spend money at the cinema.","

I was fine with the movie and thought that it was well done, however I dragged my spouse to it, whom I knew would not be a fan, and he was left with a worse feeling than I even expected. Needless to say that he will not be seeing the next installment. Following this movie, we then saw Fast and Furious X, which was also an unadvertised two parter. Hollywood needs to do a better job of alerting folks to this so that an informed decision can be made. It seems that movies are getting longer, and are we now seeing that even 2 1/2 hours isn't adequate to tell a story?","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","2 June 2023","After the explosion of the super collider, there is a growing threat to all known worlds. The nature, identity and responsibility of being a Spider-person is examined.This is much bigger than the first, and they even manage to address the rare flaws: this time, despite the many universes and literally hundreds of characters, it never loses focus on Miles Morales(Moore, spot-on), and the creative, memorable action scenes are now each completely, not only mostly, unique. Considering what I just described, you might not believe me when I say that somehow this manages to not be completely overwhelming. That they managed to make the concept simultaneously infinite in possibility and yet not let it get overpowering.You can watch this without having any prior knowledge of the original movie, the comics, or other iterations. It will tell you everything you need to know. Certain things won't have the same emotional impact, and you will have to pay extremely close attention. But they actually managed it. Your average Spider-Man movie says that a person(way too frequently a Peter Parker, about time we got some more diversity) bitten by the right spider will gain superpowers, don a suit and fight crime. This one expands that into Various animals, shows literally dozens of them, in addition to featuring some great representation(ethnic, gender, age, body size). I would have loved to see openly trans individuals, especially considering the intense reactionary backlash against a split second frame in one of the trailers. Here's hoping we'll get there in part three.This is rated PG. There is no swearing or sexuality, and violence is mild. I recommend this to everyone. Regardless of your age, you can find something to love in this. 10/10.","

"cadillac20","3 June 2023","Can't rave enough about this movie. Everything was excellent and I have nothing I can think of to complain about. It was a joy to be back, hanging out with Miles, Gwen, Peter, and the handful of new characters. The film takes it's time early on developing Gwen and Miles as they live their separate lives in their respective dimensions and deal with the frustrations and realities of being their own Spider persons. We're immediately given the emotional weight of Gwen's life, one that is very lonely and who has seemingly lost the only friend she had left after having to say goodbye to Miles. Miles is in a similar predicament, though he is less hung up on being alone and missing Gwen, and more so on having to balance school, his responsibilities to his parents, and his role as Spider-Man.After spending some time with their respective lives, we get to the meat of the story, which involves new villain-of-the-week-becoming-major-villain The Spot, who is setting out to further disrupt the multiverse after Kingpin's plot in the first movie. Miguel O'Hara, aka Spider-Man 2099, comes into the picture as having established a hub of Spider characters from various dimensions who are attempting to fix the anomalies created by the collider's explosion from the first film. Miguel acts as a darker version of Spider-Man who has little tolerance for anyone treating their task with anything but the utmost seriousness.The animation and art is once again excellent, this time giving us various designs for the different Spider characters, with Spider Punk and Crimson Spider being highlights. Everyone gets a chance to shine as a character, even when their part is small and the loads of easter eggs and references will delight fans while not feeling superfluous or there purely for fan service. Like No Way Home, this is a celebration of the Spider-Man franchise, but feeling like it's celebrating the entirety of the brand, covering everything from comics, animation, live action, and even the video games. There are quite a few pleasant surprises.Some might be off put by the abrupt ending, especially if they have no idea this the first part of a two part film duoglogy, but having known this going in, I felt pretty comfortable with where it ended. It is a cliffhanger ending, so don't expect to feel like the story has an ending, but it creates an anticipation for the next movie and it's something I can wait patiently for as it comes early next year. Overall, the film, like the first one, demonstrates itself to be one of the year's best. I even expect this to possibly be my favorite film of 2023.","

"otto_tieleman","3 July 2023","Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse continues where Spider-man: into the spider-verse left of.What changed is the scale of the story and the with of animation used to tell the story. The first movie shook up the animation world in a positive way and we can see it's influence in movies like Puss in Boots 2. But this movie expands on it's ambition in animation to go even wilder and more inventive.All the beautiful animation won't be much if the story didn't live up to the animation. We have seen many Marvel films and tv series from Marvel/Disney that have degrade to the point of bloated CGI without any enticing stories, loveless created only to make money but don't deliver on the rich world the comic books have created. Thankfully Sony wiped the slate clean and created a unique, excited and touching story. Not only Miles Morales has an incredible story arch but every side character that is created for the story. Making all characters relatable and it makes you care.Go watch this movie if you can on the best screen you can find as it is worth your money and time and that is something we couldn't have said for a long time for a super hero movie.","

"ritesh657","3 June 2023","SpidermanAcrossTheSpiderverseReviewMy Rating : 96/100Across The Spiderverse is a spellbinding and mesmerizing experience and passes the sequel test with aplomb. Starting from developing the endearing characters we loved from the first part, it adds a few solid new ones which are written as brilliantly as we can expect. The dazzling cinematography and animations leaves you tranfixed and the thrilling plot shifts leave you floored. Spiderverse is expanded vividly with the captivating work of humour, emotions and keeps you excited for what next throughout. The loudest hooting when Pavitra Prabhakar , our very own desi Indian Spider-Man comes on screen got me exhilarated. With almost all emotions getting evoked with the drama, tension and elevated climax, the cliffhanger makes me thrilled for the final act. Magical experience.The writing is superlative and introduction of the new concept of Canon event definitely opens up new possibilities. Miguel's Spiderman is terrorizing and adds more seriousness to the plot. While the emotional moments of Miles and Gwen with their family add to the list of winsome moments during the course of the runtime. Manhattan is now Mumbattan and Pavitra Prabhakar made us go crazy. The action and visuals are enthralling to say the least.Overall, if you likes the part 1 stop reading ahead and go watch this epic spectacle asap and if you haven't then its the right time of this weekend to catch up both parts and join in the community of Miles Morales fan club.Instagram & Twitter : streamgenx.","

In other words, it's not afraid to make you feel things and maybe scare your kids a little, despite the PG rating.Comparisons may not always be the best thing, but I believe this movie is better made than No Way Home.The twists at the end were completely unexpected.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","11 June 2023","'Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023)' is overwhelmingly fantastic. I'm still buzzing just thinking about it. If the first flick put the bar for stylised animation in the stratosphere, this just catapulted it into another dimension. It's hard to put into words just how viscerally vibrant and visually stunning it is. Its set-pieces simply hit different. The animation, the energy, the aesthetics, the choreography, the music, the sound design, everything just comes together in its unique brand of finely-tuned controlled chaos that keeps each and every exhilarating moment crystal clear even when there's a million different things happening all at once. It's phenomenal. It isn't afraid to pump the breaks every once in a while, too. It slows down considerably to develop its characters and explore their relationships with one another. It's actually quite an emotional experience at times. It has an unconventional structure and, as a result, it takes some pretty big swings with its story. There are some sequences that could have been tightened up and I really wish the picture had retained its original Part One title just to temper people's expectations, but the fact that this film's biggest flaw is simply that it ends is almost unbelievable. I can't say it's better than 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)' because it's essentially only half of what it's eventually going to be, but it's a miracle that it's at least as good as that masterpiece (and even outperforms it in terms of sheer spectacle). If they manage to stick the landing with the upcoming sequel (which I have no doubt they will), this is going to be one of the best five-hour movies ever made.","

"Rectangular_businessman","29 June 2023","Does Across the Spider-Verse really deserves the 8.9 score it currently holds on Imdb? I don't know, but I enjoyed it immensely from beginning to end, leaving my hopes very high for its next part.Despite its unusual lenght, it never gets boring, keep the same level of fun and excitement from its predecessor, with a rather impressive mixture of many different animation styles and a solid characterization for its large cast.The bar has been set pretty high, and I really hope the sequel does not disappoint. I think it would the be the ultimate resolution of all the loose ends left here which will ultimately decide the staying power of the Spiderverse series.8.5/10.","

"Dominic_25_","6 June 2023","I don't remember how long it has been since I've seen the first one but I am pretty sure I liked it better than this one. This is both a sequel and an unfinished story which negatively impacts my interpretations.First of all this film is once again really well done, visually. They went from the interesting art style of the first one to expanding and giving the other universes unique styles. It is so well done and so pretty and I only rarely got overwhelmed with the visuals. I can think of only once. This is a really great film to look at. The filmmakers did such an amazing job.The story is incomplete but pretty well done. I would rather have seen a 6 hour film than a part one. I like how they expanded the characters from the first film and explored more of the multiverse. I am not a huge fan of references to the MCU but the short references to the other live action Spider-Man films are less annoying. Also I only get like half of the references to the comics because I have never read a single Spider-Man comic book. But that's fine I'm not really interested in fan service, if I knew more I might just have been more annoyed. So I loved it and I loved seeing so many different versions of this character. Hobie is my favorite character, once I got used to his accent I realized he has amazing politics. I loved everything he did in this film and I wanted to see more of him but I'm guessing we'll get more of him in part 2.Being a film so heavily interconnected to comics, I feel like they decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to end it on a cliffhanger but they were wrong. The MCU does this thing where they don't have their films be self-contained stories and so they are fine with leaving threads open and teasing future installments. All very similar to actual comic books which are famous for their cliffhangers. Unfortunately, this is a film and I treat them as such because I like films more than comics. If they wanted to tell a grand story then make it a longer movie, I can handle it. Whether they did it because they wanted a second release date for more money, or they did it because of the logistics of having a 3-hour plus movie, I think it was a bad idea. If I wanted an incomplete story that ends on a cliffhanger then I'd read a comic or watch a show.I do think this film justifies it's own existence and I'm glad it was made. I think this story was interesting enough to carry a 6 hour runtime so it could have finished the story. I didn't mind 2.5 hours because it was such a fun story and the visuals were fantastic. Once the second part comes out I'll probably pretend this was just one long movie.","

"burntoutboy","2 June 2023","Wow wow wow. This is absolute masterpiece, cannot fault it at all. The animation is probably the best I've ever seen. The level of detail is ridiculous and the amount of effort that went into making this is clearly shown. The voice acting is great, the music is great, it's funny and lots of cool Easter eggs. The story is great as well and leads perfectly into the sequel which I absolutely cannot wait for.I wouldn't be surprised if not only if this was nominated for best animated picture at the Oscars but also best picture, it's that good.There's nothing more to say, just go watch it in yh Cinema and appreciate the art!","

"awsafzidane","2 June 2023","One of the most overwhelming movie experiences of my life. A feast for the visual and auditory senses.I had HUGE expectations from this as the first one is one of my favourite animated movies of all time, and this one even surpassed those!It's one of the longest animated movies of Hollywood, but it doesn't drag for a single moment. There's so much happening in this film, it feels like a miracle that it still works so well! So many different animation styles, such great use of colours that portray the emotions of each scene perfectly, dope soundtrack, countless Easter Eggs; and it still doesn't feel exhausting. So many characters and almost all of them have distinct characteristics. You can sense that the creators have an amazing understanding of the characters, and they do them full justice.But it's not just a compilation of awesome psychedelic animation with some great score, it has a fascinating plot too. It handles the multiverse well, delivers a couple of neat plot twists, while being an emotional coming-of-age story of a couple of teenagers trying to balance their dual lives, and maintaining their relationship with their parents.It's the best Spider-Man film ever made. It's one of the best movies ever made.Now I can't wait for the final film which will establish the Spider-Verse trilogy as one of the greatest trilogies of all time.","

"jay632","4 June 2023","To be quite honest, the first one was unique, but i didn't think it was great. This movie took everything it learned from part 1 and made vast improvements on every level.This was the multiverse movie i was looking for that the mcu just never did properly. The worlds had depth and not just skipping through it as fast as possible without a chance to digest it.Story was good too, i wasn't expecting much, since we already got the backstory in part 1. But they did a great job expanding the story.Animation also improved from part 1, it was really unique, but they just made it better.By far my favorite part are the cameo's of different spidermans. There's so many, this is fan service done right.","

The animation was perfect no complaints Gwen was a better character in this movie than the first movie more intenersting and compelling. This is the best version of the Spot he was funny but over-time he became a huge threat to every spider-verse in fact every multi-verse. Miguel was ruthless and a very compelling antagonist. And every joke made me laugh.no bad jokes unlike the MCU now. I was suprised how good this was. The ending could make people disappointed but i wasn't i was hyped for the next one.","

"willphelan","4 November 2023","I never thought Into the Spider Verse was a movie that needed a sequel, but Across the Spider Verse is just as incredible as Into the Spider Verse. The animation style is even more beautiful than in the first movie, every shot looks like a painting. The exploration of Miles and Gwen and what it really means to be Spider Man is excellent, and leads to so many deep and emotional moments. Every scene with Miles' parents were top tier. The voice cast all gave it everything they had, and Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen was the stand out for me. The cliffhanger ending was so epic, it actually gave me chills. If the third movie is as good as these first two this might become the best trilogy of all time. 10/10.","

"leekeithf","9 September 2023","Absolute cracker of a film! Forget that it's animated, it is a film and first rate at that. The animation is out of this world, the music amazing, the story top notch and script superb. It's not often you get everything just right, but this surpasses getting it right; it's an amazing film. Even the Brit-Punk Spiderman, they got it spot on. The humour is also good and pitched at the right level, even having an apt joke about the villain talking about holes. The characters were well thought out, the dialogue was appropriate and well written. In fact, my son & I cannot criticise any of it. It's on par with the Christopher Nolan Batman films. If they could apply this level to something like DC's Injustice it would be brill. I am so glad I watched it and it's part of a 3 piece story, not just a sequel because it will make money. The story is coherent and sound and the level of research that has gone into getting it right has worked. I cannot praise it enough.","

"Blashma","1 June 2023","The movie did a great job in the first part and I really enjoyed it so personally I am especially looking forward to the second part and after watching the movie it exceeded my expectations.I love how the film expands its scope and adds more stories to the characters, specifically Gwen (Gwanda), in the new cast I'm super impressed with Oscar Isaac as the voice of Miguel O 'hara , he's been through enough pain to make himself responsible for protecting Spider-Verse and believing himself to be right no matter what . Speaking of Miles, he's really matured in this part, he's just a 15 year old kid who has to balance his Spider-man lifestyle with himself, I like the way Miles tackles problems differently from the rest of Spider-Man . The movie is really fan service, making viewers satisfied with every detail, graphics and family story of Spider-Man.I love every moment of this movie and am looking forward to the sequel, hopefully more Miles and Spider-Verse movies will come out.","

"IsThatJoseph21","4 June 2023","For the past two years, No Way Home was my favorite Spider-Man movie. Now, that title belongs to Across the Spider-Verse. Besides being a great Spider-Man movie, I'd consider this a great movie in general. I just saw Across the Spider-Verse, but I already feel comfortable placing this movie in the same category of sequels like The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, Terminator 2, and The Dark Knight, which surpass every aspect of their predecessors.I love Into the Spider-Verse as much as everyone else, but I believe Across the Spider-Verse improves everything from the first movie. The one part of Into the Spider-Verse that always held it back from a 10/10 to me is the villains. Kingpin and the Prowler are serviceable, but I always thought they were uninteresting. With Across the Spider-Verse, the villain is a major improvement. Miguel O'Hara had a compelling motivation, while also being a genuinely threatening antagonist.I already thought Into the Spider-Verse's animation was breathtaking, but Across the Spider-Verse somehow surpasses it. The entire movie looks like a work of art, but the highlight for me would be every scene in Gwen's universe. The backgrounds and colors in those scenes are gorgeous. Just like the first movie, the fights here are fast-paced and fun. There are plenty of memorable action scenes here, but I particularly loved the first fight between Miles Morales and the Spot.This is sort of out of topic, but I also think Across the Spider-Verse was a better multiverse movie than Multiverse of Madness. Not only was the concept of other dimensions better utilized in Across the Spider-Verse, they were also more visually distinct here. Maybe it's because of the fact that this movie is animated, but each dimension in Across the Spider-Verse was able to have their own style and color to them, unlike the ones featured in Multiverse of Madness.Overall, Across the Spider-Verse is yet another masterpiece in the Spider-Verse series. It's both my favorite Spider-Man movie and my favorite movie of 2023. I know this year isn't over yet, but it's going to be tough to top this movie. I give Across the Spider-Verse a 10/10.","

Across the Spider-Verse is everything I wanted in a Spider-Man movie and is the perfect sequel. Most importantly even with all the spider characters/cameos this is still Miles' movie. That ending?!?! We're really about to get one of the best trilogies ever.Special thank you to all the artists that contributed to this movie. I don't know how they do it, but visually Across the Spider-Verse is on another level. There are so many shots that blew my mind. I can't wait to break down this movie frame by frame. This is just the beginning. I know this movie is going to consume my life for the next couple of years.","

Man he's not hobie he is HOMIE.Indian Spiderman ""Pav"" is super cute and plays important role in the movie.. (btw love the way he swings, just super unique and satisfying)Gwen learning to take 'leap of faith' from miles is soo deep.. she keeps being scared of messing things up and not harming the one she loves the most (obviously miles) but in other hand miles is ready to risk it all..Miguel is super cool.. has other perception towards faith and multiverse (just like Dr strange)AND can't just get over the cuteness of Mayday..

"inovski","11 June 2023","We waited 5 years for a sequel and let me tell you, it was worth it.This movie had me glued to my seat for the entirety of it's runtime. I loved everything about this movie hence why I rated it a 10.Animation: The animation was breathtaking, it never seized to amaze me. It is so obvious from the get go that the people behind this movie put in so much time and effort to create what's probably the best spiderman adaptation that exists. Without the talent and dedication from the animators, this movie wouldn't even be half as good.The plot: Superb all in all, everything tied together very well and I enjoyed how we had 2 storylines at the same time that get tied together, which makes the whole story that much better and immersive. I'm sad that we have to wait another 3-5 years for the next one but at least we know it will be perfect.The characters: They perfectly captured spiderman's charm and humor. The small differences they showed in each spiderman was really fun to see as well.All in all this movie took what the first one did well and made it basically perfect. This is the first time I've come out of the theater without any cons to list. If you haven't watched the movie yet, DO IT NOW!","

"neil-476","2 June 2023","Miles Morales' second adventure brings him back into contact with Spider-Gwen. Outcast from her own universe where she has been erroneously accused of the death of her Peter, she is now working with a squad of spider-people patrolling the multiverse. Meanwhile, Miles as problems with new villain, The Spot.Plotwise and characterwise, this is fun. It mixes some emotional character stuff with exciting action, and interesting (and sometimes unexpected) plot developments, right up to the end. Oh did I say ""The End""?...There's plenty of fan service here.Yes, but what does it look like? Because the look of the first one was striking, right? I bet this is jnot as good, or just more of the same, right?Wrong. The look of this film, whether a quiet scene in an office, or a hyper-kinetic action scene, is simply dazzling. There are so many animation styles, and touches, and tweaks, and Every. Single. One of them serves a dramatic purpose in the storytelling.Fantasic.","

"cstull91","8 June 2023","The film made me so upset because there was no epilepsy or flashing lights warning, horrid sound mixing, and overall so flashy it just wasn't fun. I got so overstimulated by the constant flashing lights that I could not enjoy the film. I was having to watch through my fingers. I don't understand why they decided to make 80% of the film a jolting van gogh kaleidoscope, that feels like you're watching it all in VR. It felt as if the Visual Team wanted the entire film to mirror the feeling you get as you're going through the wormhole sequence in Doctor Strange, but for 2.5hrs. Kinda feels Ableist to be honest. I could not enjoy the film, it was torturous. I am deeply saddened by just how flashy the film was. Also, what was the message of the film? Parenting is hard and it's ok to be selfish to get what you desire, regardless of consequences? I'm really confused by the high scores. I consider myself to be a cinephile, with having seen thousands of films and enjoying most all films, sometimes even bad ones. I am saddened to say that I am deeply in disagreement with the 9.1 current rating and 90% rotten, it makes no sense to me at all. This film was so over produced that it made my head physically hurt. Sony, maybe try and be less ableist when you're thinking about creating 2hrs of strobe light animation; it didn't need the consistent glitching, pulsating, and flashing mechanic to the multi-layered animation styles.It honestly felt expensive, but overall just lazy.Really disappointed.","

I definitely saw a lot of potential, but the plot was too overwhelming with so many things in the background. Main thing that i didn't like was the lack of action. I went to watch this movie to see a great plot, and a ton of action, but that certainly didn't happen.The first 40 minutes of the movie covers just the main characters which i found pretty boring. Rest of the movie was just 20 things happening at the same time. I felt like falling asleep halfway through, but luckilt at least there was some action.Definitely an ""Avengers: infinity war"" try, but lacks action. 7/10 at most.","

"thePopcornExplorer","24 June 2023","I think as audiences we know how hard it is for sequels to meet our expectations when the first installment of a saga was already an outstanding piece of art, it feels so good when sequels keep those standards...The sequel of the Spider-Verse gets almost everything right, it manages to bring you back to the insanely original multiverse storyline that was introduced to us on the first film, yet it manages to not fall into the trap of being a repetitive storyline with the same elements.I can't even properly comment the animation work, there are no words to describe how amazing it is, the detail that each universe depicted seems to have its own kind of animation is insane and it continues to be without a doubt the only Marvel / DC movie to make a proper homage to comic books, the original super hero format.It keeps the frenetic energy that the first got us used to, something is always happening and it's interesting to keep following, elements of the first story are brought to continue the protagonists journey and it's an organic narrative, doesn't feel like a forced story line for the sake of a sequel, it makes sense.All universes are beautifully animated, the soundtrack gives you ton of energy, everywhere in the movie you see marvelous imagery, a true piece of art.Adding the this the voice acting is also on point, it's an animated movie and it feels that it is leading the way on how animation should be used specially on the super hero / comic book adaptation world.Filled with dramatic and eye tearing moments and of course with themes that are transversal to probably every person either parent or child and that most of us can probably relate, gives soul to an already beautiful film. A pioneer film that continues on top of its game, I can't wait for the third..!","

I didn't like Juan Guarnizo's voice too much, Pipe Punk's a little bit yes, and I had even read that the youtuber Jugando con Natalia (Juan Manuel Paradiso) had participated in the Latin dubbing, if you can tell me which character he dubbed, I would be very grateful, even being the most attentive, I still can't figure out which character he dubbed his voice to.Besides, I have to admit that I didn't watch ""Into the Spider-Verse"", only several clips, although I still managed to understand the movie and the story.God, when I saw the ending I was left with all the intrigue in the world, and I was like well, let's wait until next year when they release part 2, there's no other way...","

There are so many Easter Eggs to spot throughout the movie, and it is so much fun to try to spot them, you never know what, or WHO might pop up in the story! 👀This ambitious sequel delves heavily into the Spider-Man mythos, and continues the story of Miles Morales Spider-Man from the Into the Spider-Verse film, but it adds more depth to some other characters that we fell in love with in the first film while introducing some other Spider-powered people. This time, they're on a mission to stop the destruction of the multiverse, by a madman known only as The Spot, who can portal in and out of the different universes within the Spider-Verse on a mission to destroy all Spiders! That's not all though, as the leader of the Spider team, Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara) comes into conflict with Miles about his place in the Spider-Verse and what it truly means to be Spider-man!Featuring a massive voice cast including Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Jason Schwartzman, Karan Soni, Daniel Kaluuya, Oscar Isaac, Greta Lee, Mahershala Ali, Andy Samberg, Rachel Dratch, Zoe Kravitz, and many many, many more, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse does truly deliver! It's a sequel that does it's job even better than the first movie, times ten! Go see this movie even if you aren't a Spider-Man or superhero fan, it's an incredible spectacle!!And, the ending of the film is one of the most spectacular endings to a movie I've seen since Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame!","

"classicsoncall","21 October 2023","When I first watched and reviewed ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", it ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Movies of All Time. It now sits at #67 as I write this. At the time, I thought the film was OK, not great, but OK. As far as animated movies go, I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright, vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters. Regarding the story however, it wasn't particularly new or innovative. How many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? This one, if I can make a timely comparison, might have been titled ""Spider-Man: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"". That comes with the territory of taking place in a multiverse, where just about anyone and anything goes. It's just a little bit too much in my estimation, making the story somewhat confusing and disjointed, perhaps perfect for the attention deficit generation, but unappealing to someone my age who grew up on the very early Spider-Man stories. There's some nod to that era, with a brief glance of an 'Amazing Fantasy #15' comic book cover, along with various other covers appearing in too rapid succession to focus on their relevance. Another turn off for me was the clichéd dialog that took place throughout the story, with phrases like 'been there, done that', 'wait, what?', and the ever-popular turn of phrase, 'are you serious, right now'. It all made for a direct appeal to an under twenty-five-year-old audience, nothing wrong with that, but with limited appeal to someone who's outgrown their teen years. At present, the movie ranks #22 on IMDb's Top 250. I think it hit as high as #11 when I was following it when it came out. That's higher than its predecessor, and will probably remain that way as both progress down the chart over time. The fact that it was not a done in one film was also a mild annoyance, particularly since it didn't recommend to me that I had to catch the next installment, considering the disorderly course of this one.","

"cedricdumler","5 June 2023","Wow. An already great year for movies, just got extended by a masterpiece of filmmaking.Just as Into the Spider-Verse did before it, Across the Spider-Verse uses the audience's familiarity with Spider-Man as a consistent source of humor which makes it all flow flawlessly.I am quite frankly obsessed with this movie. There are six different animation styles featured in the film - and my goodness this is the most awe-inspiring animation I've ever seen in a film. Using stunning visuals as a way to elevate the emotion and action in every scene. Never seen the like. The voice acting is sublime (the dialogue between Miles and Gwen goes right under the skin), the characters are multi-faceted, the action sequences are electric, the music is mesmerizing and, my word, the storyline is the perfect balance of emotional depth and meticulously timed comic relief.I also love how Across the Spider-Verse balances setting up a sequel while being its own movie. Miles and Gwen have tidy and concluding arcs with enormous growth, as it still ends on a true cliffhanger. It's among the best part ones I've ever seen.This movie is pure art put on canvas, with every frame. Soulfull. A genuine love letter to Spider-Man and filmmaking itself.Note:
It's time for everyone to appreciate animated film as a true film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly demonstrates that you can't achieve and convey the same with a live-action film as with an animated film. The richness of emotions that this masterpiece conveys benefits greatly from the animation and its mesmerizing style.","

"ryanwesthamfan","3 June 2023","Quite simply perfection. This movie does not disappoint whatsoever. I've been hyped for this film ever since that first trailer dropped and it was worth the wait. The visuals are even better than the first one (which I didn't think was even possible) it is quite simply a groundbreaking film and the way that it is able to explore spider man in a way you can only do in animation. It is very rare you get sequels these days that are able to be even better than the original but this film definitely does that.Overall Thoughts- This film is a much watch. Stop what you're doing right now go to the cinema and watch this film because it is a masterpiece in every single way and I think I will only love this film even more on rewatch. Overall I'm going to give Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse an easy 10/10.","

"jaspercobar","25 June 2023","Spider Man across the spider verse was nearly perfect. The only flaw was the ending. It did rap up well though. Gwen assembled a Spider Man team to find Miles, Miles went to a universe were his uncle was still alive, and that Miles was the Prowler. So it really did get me excited for the next one, but at the same time I was pissed off that I have to wait another year to see it. It was a cliffhanger, but a good one. The ending could of been worse though, because I thought it was going to end with the Spot arriving in Gwen's current universe, and start attacking Miles's Dad. Just imagine that cliffhanger. Other then the ending, the movie was perfect. It had an amazing soundtrack, amazing action, amazing comedy. Amazing acting. The best part though was the small cameos, e.g when it showed the lady from the dairy in Venom, and Donald Glover as the Prowler. I'd recommend this movie, but not for little kids, because the plot is to confusing. It involves a lot of multiverse madness, that you really have to pay attention in order to understand.","

"crwnroyale","25 June 2023","This is a movie is a must watch after you see the first one. You will not be disappointed. Nicely made family movie. I also truly enjoyed that I didn't notice any subliminal targeting of sexuality. Miles is still trying to grown into himself and figure out who he is. He is a smart young man but struggles with balancing life as hero, student, and a son. This movie has some classic throwback moments that links it to other spider-man movies.You will be drawn into the movie quick and begging for more. It was very funny noticing that Miles isn't the only spider-man that tries to disguise their true voice when talking to family.","

"chapterfourax","14 July 2023","The amount of work put into small details fro
the animators in this is spectacular.The way that Miles is animated at a slower fps when he's still learning to control his powers to the faster fps when he embraces them is a great example of visual story telling.To the way that he moves in the streets of the city listening to his music and putting stickers up while he is in his comfort zone to the duality of when he enters the new school for the first time and is overwhelmed and stumbling overhimself uncomfortable.A really amazing story as well about pushing yourself past your limits and that all it takes is ""a leap of faith"". Further symbolized by Miles pushing away from the mirror and breaking it when he makes his first jump in suit, showing despite him not being ready yet he forces and pushes himself to be.","

"jared-25331","5 June 2023","As a fan of Spider-Man, I was invested in watching this movie, especially since I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse back in 2018. After watching Across the Spider-Verse, I can easily say that this movie was phenomenal in every way possible from beginning to end. It's easily my 2nd favorite Spider-Man Movie just behind Spider-Man 2 (2004). I can honestly say that if Beyond the Spider-Verse is just as phenomenal or even better than this movie, then the Spider-Verse Trilogy will forever go down in history as one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history. This movie is absolutely a must watch for both Superhero & Animated movie fans.A Perfect 10/10!!!!!","

His expression was one of pure joy and utterly caught up in the story.Even is amped up, the range of art styles, the range of spider-people, the depth of story, performances. Everything is divine.Picking up with Gwen, lost and out of focus, missing Miles who is letting spider work take over school.Obviously they meet up and the fun kicks up. But when I say everything works it does. The laughs from Miles parents, the loss the Gwen's father for his lost daughter.The music is a perfect fit again. This movie is just a joy, it's darker, bigger, and just outstanding.","

"shubhampatelspam","16 June 2023","A complete pack of plot twists, humor, emotions, action, and amazing characters. Everything about this movie is just great. The animations, as usual, are mind-blowing and, I think, better than the first Spider Verse movie. The movie ends with the perfect cliffhanger. Even if you haven't watched any of the other Marvel movies, this one would blow your mind. However, having some knowledge about the MCU and knowing what happened in the first movie would help enhance the experience, as the other spiderman movies, starting from Tobey Maguire to Tom Holland, just gives one a perspective of the big picture and how everything connects. After Endgame, Marvel movies started going downhill and most fans, including myself, don't like it as much as the movies before. This movie, although not part of the actual MCU, has reignited my interest for Marvel movies and I am sure the next movie would be the same.","

This is one of the best movies created and it is this generations The Dark Knight and The Shawshank Redemption.

"calebbrookscj","8 June 2023","Over many years, sequels have been known to sweep Hollywood off its feet. Making films like Empire strikes back and Top Gun Maverick which were absolutely superior to their predecessors in every way. Now Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse does that absolute feat after the audience patiently awaited for Miles Morales's return to the big screen after 5 years. Every single member of the Animation team poured their heart and soul's into each individual design for not only the locations but also each individual character. Even with this film being one piece of the pie, it is quite delectable in every way.Person note: In 2018,I experienced Miles Morales's origin for the first time when i watched Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse at the Cinemark Theater, which in all honesty became one of my favorite films of all time. It's animation was one of the most unique styles that I had laid my eyes on at the time. The use of a multiverse gave a perfect blend of characters to help Miles story grow. So after the film gained it's successful stardom, the announcement of a two parted sequel hit the internet by a storm of support, which is particularly the best reaction the internet could give. No one could comprehend how remarkable it would become.Across the Spider-Verse is what would be regarded as a Spider-Man fans dream film. It not only respects the source material given from the films, games and comics but it also gives a compelling story that everyone will love and isn't dragged by it's sheer amount of cameos. The easter eggs and references that are incorporated into the film are used very well and will in all honesty blow the audience's minds.","

"speedycomics","10 August 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute triumph in the world of animated superhero films. As a huge fan of the first Spider-Verse movie, my expectations were sky-high, and I am thrilled to say that this sequel not only met but exceeded them. From start to finish, it was a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that left me on the edge of my seat.One of the standout aspects of this film is its animation style. The combination of traditional hand-drawn animation with cutting-edge CGI creates a unique and vibrant visual experience. The attention to detail is impeccable, with every frame bursting with color and energy. The action sequences are mind-blowing, with the characters leaping off the screen and swinging through the city with incredible fluidity. It truly feels like a comic book come to life.The story takes place after the events of the first film, and it delves deeper into the multiverse concept. Miles Morales, the young Spider-Man, embarks on a journey across different dimensions, encountering various versions of Spider-Man along the way. The narrative is engaging and keeps you hooked from start to finish. It seamlessly blends humor, heart, and high-stakes action, making for a well-rounded and satisfying experience.The voice acting is top-notch, with Shameik Moore reprising his role as Miles Morales. He brings a youthful energy and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and likable. The supporting cast, including Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy and Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, also deliver fantastic performances, adding depth and humor to their respective roles.What sets this film apart is its ability to tackle complex themes and emotions. It explores the idea of identity, the weight of responsibility, and the importance of family and friendship. These themes are handled with care and resonate on a deep level, making the characters feel more human and relatable.If I had to nitpick, there were a few moments where the pacing felt slightly rushed, and some characters could have been given more screen time. However, these minor flaws do not detract from the overall excellence of the film.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for any fan of the superhero genre. It is a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that will leave you wanting more. With its incredible animation, engaging story, and memorable characters, it deserves a solid 9 out of 10. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the Spider-Verse franchise.","

"No-Life-101","10 August 2023","I finally got around to watching Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse and I'm so happy that I did, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and know I'll be rewatching it soon. I managed to avoid spoilers for this movie and I'm so happy that I did because I went in not knowing anything besides information from the previous movie. This movie starts by giving us Gwen's backstory which I found heartbreaking, the visuals were strong and the music added to the story and then from there we go back to Miles which the story focuses on. I like the subtle detail of the music changing depending on what dimension they're in and who's involved, I also loved the themes being incorporated into the music too.The character introductions were amazing, funny, and unique to every spider person, I love how they animated everyone differently depending on what dimension they came from to show that difference. Also, their designs! I'm in love with them all, they're so detailed, it almost leaves me speechless. As well as I love how everyone interacts with their environment, they see things from unique perspectives and move in such bouncy ways that it looks natural for anybody to do, but I know that if I tried to move the way they did I'd pull something. But this detail especially shows during action scenes, they make the world seem bigger, and they make the fights engaging and fun to watch.Storywise, I loved the comedy and found myself laughing at the jokes and how the characters interacted. I loved the natural mix of different languages and when the characters were speaking in their native language I felt like that was just between characters and not really for the audience to understand what's being said but how it's being said. Also, the visual details of character growth since the previous movie, Miles grew, Gwen grew and her hair got longer, it makes it seem like just because we don't see the characters their lives are still ongoing. I also loved the connection between Miles and the villain, it calls back to the previous movie.Overall, this movie is not only visually appealing but emotional too. The music is powerful, and the story is engaging and at times funny too. I did not see that plot twist ending though, but it makes me excited to see another movie!","

The entire animation style is revolutionary, I don't think I've ever seen anything like it before. Pair all these up with soundtracks that if called masterpieces, would be understated. Each of the soundtracks are so good that you'd really find a hard time choosing the best one. Not to mention the perfect timing to utilize the soundtracks so that you get the best possible experience on the theatre.Honestly man, I thought its predecessor already set the bar too high, and it won't be able to cross that. But I got to tell you, I was wrong.","

"TheRealPetraeus","3 June 2023","An unparalleled feat in the animation genre and cinema as a whole. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece and everything a Spider-Man fan would want. Truly a masterclass in juggling plentiful references, amazing character moments, an interesting and well thought-out story, mesmerizing action sequences, and an incredibly memorable soundtrack. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse handles all of this, along with the best animation that has graced the film industry. The different styles of each world and character mesh with each other so smoothly, it leads to every frame being pure eye-candy.While the breakneck pacing, frantic action sequences, and immensely colorful animation can lead to some viewers feeling overwhelmed (me included), those same viewers will find themselves ready to roll into the sequel once the credits start to roll. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse uses animation to convey so much emotion, which is incredibly difficult to do in the live-action medium. Even though this movie is still a kids movie, the story becomes so much darker and more emotional than I expected. Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse was much more mature than your average kids movie, but this is able to crank the maturity up a notch, but still maintains a fun atmosphere.The comedy is also genuinely great, and manages to be leagues funnier than your average comedy show such as Family Guy . The banter and dialogue between the characters is so natural and well-written that the slowest parts of the movie are still incredibly entertaining. Each bit of long running dialogue has so many hints and jokes throughout, that the chance of your brain processing all of them in a single watch is unlikely. This also applies to the bountiful amount of references in the background of so many different shots. The soundtrack is also just perfect, and is filled with very memorable tracks.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is just perfection. Is it better than its predecessor? No doubt, and that's coming from someone who believes Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is perfect. Yes, they somehow made a movie better than literal perfection. I can't wait for the conclusion to these two cinematic masterpieces and I have no doubt that they will stick the landing. There is so much to love in this movie, that I doubt I could cover everything in a single review. I believe Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has solidified itself as the best Spider-Man film, the best superhero film, and quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever made.","

"dcdude-26988","3 June 2023","This has to be a top three movie/film for me personally. Just let me explain why before you are gonna go like, ""Top 3?!"". The whole movie literally explains in every reason why most Spider-Men in different demensions have the same exact storyline and background stories. A spiderman gets bit, falls in love, and then has a loved one die. That is what happens in every Spider-Man story, and this film literally explains it to us all. Not to mention, the whole storyline about Gwen relates to as of why she cares about Miles alot. Anyways, the animation has to be some of the best animation that we have seen so far, and the visuals were amazing as well. The film is kind of mind controlable at the same time, and here is why before you ask. At first, the movie was like, ""Why are you showing all of this so slowly"", but then, at some of the ending parts, it literally explains why they were. Speaking of ending parts, the plot twists were amazing as well. Some of them are like, ""oh, I get it"", and others were like ""WHAT?!"", which means that this movie was able to balance it very well. In my opinion, I think that this and the previous represent and show how the multiverse works alot better than the Marvel Cinematic Universe has ever done.","

"hoshouchian","5 June 2023","I don't even know where to start. I already had unhealthy high expectations for this movie, yet it still exceeded those expectations far beyond reach. It lives up to its title by plunging us right back into the chaotic madness of the multiverse by delving into Gwen's perspective, exploring her dynamics with her family and the hardships that come with juggling two different identities while not letting either one overlap or dominate. The Gwen-centered prologue spans for a whopping 15 minutes. It chronicled everything from dramatic character-affirming moments and extravagant artistic expression to mesmerisingly fluid action sequences and laugh-out-loud snippets of levity. It's basically a microcosm of what we are about to expect from the remaining runtime, giving us just a taste of the absolute carnage that is bound to unfold. And my god, did this movie deliver!This sequel stands tall alongside Empire Strikes Back and Judgment Day as one of the worthiest successors of a pre-established masterpiece. But it's not only a masterpiece, it's a true work of art. It lies one step above masterpiece. It's a Renaissance painting come to life. You can just randomly pause at a scene and take a screenshot and it'll be a beautiful wallpaper. I thought Into The Spider-Verse was the pinnacle of superhero storytelling. Man, I was never this wrong. I'm telling you this blows Into The Spider-Verse out of the freaking water. It not only reaches new heights. It tears up the sky and shoots you beyond the stratosphere. I am shocked to the core at how revolutionary this movie is. I have never seen anything like it. The experience I had in the cinema is nothing short of spellbinding. This movie had me strapped on tight in my seat right from the get go, then had me in a suffocating stranglehold, refusing to loosen its grip, let alone let go, and throttled me towards a rollercoaster ride of emotions and feelings, I don't even know how to react.This is a mindblowing experience that left me speechless at times, laughing for the most part, and utterly petrified by its closing hour. My eyes were glued to the screen for the entire time, I never felt the 2-hour-and-20-minute runtime and it felt like I was right there beside the characters. My jaw was wide open the entire time, I could not believe what I was being exposed to. And I thought watching Infinity War and Endgame was the high point of my moviegoing experience. No, this is not only a cinematic experience I will never forget. This is something else entirely. This is something special. This is a cinematic miracle. The fact that they pulled this off with flying colours is insane. Everybody is firing on all cylinders. From the seamless blend of countless different animation styles, the striking colours, the stark contrasts, to the deliberate compositions, this is a visual feast unlike any other. This is a textbook testament to the creative potential of animation. There can be a scene with two people talking, and the background is filled with so much detail. Every single frame, shot and sequence is meticulously devised and painstakingly choreographed. It's lively, it's dynamic, it's moving.And amidst the dizzying array of visual cacophony lies a story that chronicles what it means to be Spider-Man. Again Miles (alongside his fellow Spider-companions) is flung head-first into wave after wave of emotional peril, exploring themes of adolescent isolation, complexities of growing up, and finding where he belongs in this vast expanse of multiversal entropy. He is put in situations that tests his resolve and integrity as a human being and as a universe-hopping superhero, clashing with different Spider-people when they present conflicting ideologies. And the way the creative team executed these moral dilemmas is nothing short of intelligent and mature by not giving us any easy or simple answers, but making us question along with the characters what the right decision is and what we would do if we are in their shoes.Not to mention, The Spot turned out to be one of most menacing villains ever to have graced the silver screen. He started out as a goofy ""villain of the week"", but then more layers get peeled off and we get to witness this 3-dimensional sculpture of a misunderstood and unfortunate guy sucked into the wrong end of a calamity. They actually made us care and understand where he's coming from, why he is the way he is, and why he's doing what he's doing. And the new Spider-people all have distinct personalities and some of them get to really shine under the spotlight. The core of the story doesn't ever get lost amidst the wild collection of cameos and Easter eggs. The team behind this franchise show that they have formed a tightly-knit kinship about what they are cooking up and what kind of a story they are trying to tell.Also, when the action settles down, the dust clears and the superheroes take off their costumes, the movie does not get less interesting. This is a grounded drama as much as it is a superhero spectacle. The dialogue in this movie is so sharp and witty, it cuts like a water jet. It takes what the first movie established and built upon that foundation by deepening the relationships of the characters and weaving more intricate elements into Miles' journey of self-discovery. And we get to just marvel at the complications and how it all plays out. Everything is laid bare. The characters are put front and center, flanked by breathtaking visual ingenuity, sharp sound design, powerful voice acting and Daniel Pemberton's sublime musical presentation.This sequel is more than a sequel. This is the best Spider-Man film ever made. This is the best superhero film ever made. This is the best animated film ever made. This is the best film of the year and possibly the best film to have come out in recent years. And it's not even close. It is a love letter to the Spider-Man canon, poking fun at familiar tropes but not forgetting to inject fresh oil to keep the engine purring. They went above and beyond for this. Every single aspect here screams perfection, from the calculated directing to the slick editing.There is not a single nanometre of a weak link. The web of life and destiny is woven with tour-de-force cinematic artistry. I am telling you that we are witnessing the birth of one of the greatest film trilogies ever made in cinematic history. I have no reason to doubt that Beyond The Spider-Verse is going to be as excellent as its era-defining predecessors. This is truly a flawless achievement that keeps you at the edge of your seat for the conclusion. See you next March!","

"Rectangular_businessman","30 June 2023","Does Across the Spider-Verse really deserves the rather impressive 8.9 score it currently holds here on the Internet Movie Database?I don't know, but I can tell I enjoyed a lot this film from beginning to end.Despite its unusual lenght, the movie never gets boring or tedious in any moment, keeping a frenetic pace in every single one of its scenes.Maybe the dialogue was a little bit too ""quippy"" in a couple of moments, but the snappy writing doesn't get in the way of the most dramatic moments, never lessening them in any manner.The animation deserves a particular mention, alternating in a rather different impressive manner several distinct visual styles, taking a full advantage of the medium in a way in which would be almost impossible to depict via live-action.This sequel lives up to the original, and left me with very high expectations towards its continuation.Now that the bar has been set up so high, I really hope the finale of the Spiderverse series doesn't disappoint.So far, the ride has been quite amazing.8.5/10.","

The creators of this epic journey have clearly poured their heart and soul into every frame, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.The animation is a tour de force, seamlessly blending diverse art styles that bring the Spider-Verse to life in a way that feels vibrant and fresh. Each scene is a feast for the eyes, painting the screen with a burst of colors and imaginative designs that will leave you breathless.Equally commendable is the strength of the narrative that effortlessly connects with the audience. The story doesn't just unfold; it entangles you in its web, ensuring that you are invested in every dramatic interaction, every thrilling fight sequence, and every emotional climax.Character development is another highlight of the film. The growth our beloved characters undergo adds layers of depth to the story, making their journeys all the more engaging. Their interactions, whether action-packed or heartwarming, are captivating and contribute greatly to the film's overall quality.The score and soundtrack are also nothing short of fire, underscoring every moment with tunes that not only set the mood but also elevate the story to new heights.However, if I absolutely have to nitpick, there are a few moments when it seems to pull on the heartstrings a tad excessively. This slight overindulgence in sentimentality is a small nitpick in an otherwise excellent film.The way the Spider-Verse is portrayed, introduced, and expanded feels effortless and organic. You get a sense of a larger universe out there, waiting to be explored, which adds to the anticipation for the next part in this thrilling saga.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning and an emotionally gripping adventure. I, for one, can't wait to see where this journey takes us next.","

"Prismark10","21 October 2023","I admired Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I did not like it enough, it was not memorable enough and it was more interested in leaving it all to a sequel.Miles Morales has to deal with a villain called The Spot. He was an Alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during a collider explosion. He now blames Miles for his condition as he also brought a spider from another dimension that bit Miles, giving him spidey superpowers.Meanwhile Miles collides with Gwen Stacy, although she is from another dimension as well, where she is also Spider-Woman.In short Miles and Gwen as well as others chase the Spot through the multiverse. Only the Spot has plans of his own.The film starts off slowly, a crawl before getting supercharged. It just lacks the punch and effervescence of the first movie in this cartoon series.","

"christianyogendran-15663","9 July 2023","I loved Into the Spider Verse, I seriously have no words to describe how spectacular Across the Spider Verse was! Somehow they managed to make the second movie better than the first!Every frame of the movie is basically a work of art. It can easily be put into an art museum. I also love how they were able to put different types of animation as well, from LEGO to non-cartoon, to comic-book.The acting is also amazing, Hailee Steinfeld actually has a bigger role in the movie and I'm so thankful that Gwen Stacy was given the emotional backstory we all wanted. The actor that plays the villain Spot is also really clever as well, but the real star of the movie is Oscar Issac. I loved his character the most, he plays his role with such passion that I've never seen from any actor. Honestly everyone did a great job at playing their roles, those three were the highlights. It wasn't like Quantamania where the acting was carried by Jonathan Majors only and the rest were really annoying.Overall, a must watch for anyone. The Spider Verse movies are meant to be directed towards kids, but honestly adults will love.","

"CelluloidConnoisseur","3 June 2023","As an avid fan of the Spider-Verse franchise, I was eagerly awaiting the release of the highly anticipated sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Let me tell you, this film did not disappoint. In fact, I dare say it surpassed its predecessor and established itself as a superior film.One of the most remarkable aspects of Across the Spider-Verse is its stunning visuals. The film seamlessly incorporates various forms of animation, creating a visually breathtaking spectacle. Every frame is a work of art, and the animation is so daring and innovative that even the simplest dialogue scenes are elevated to new heights.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance its visual extravaganza with a smart, character-driven story. It explores themes of fate, friendship, and the sacrifices heroes must make. The joy of discovery and emotional generosity, which were the soul of the original Into the Spider-Verse, are still present in abundance. The film manages to be inventive, thrilling, funny, ridiculous, heartwarming, frenetic, and even sad, all at once.Across the Spider-Verse also deserves praise for its willingness to entrust its storytelling to its animation. The visuals not only enhance the story but become an integral part of it, propelling the narrative forward in unexpected ways. The film takes risks, and they pay off splendidly.The movie's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers yearning for more, and it's a bittersweet realization that we'll have to wait until March 2024 for the conclusion. Nonetheless, this film stands on its own as an instant classic. It maintains the whimsical energy of its predecessor while offering a fresh perspective with a slightly different writing lineup.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates exceptional storytelling and groundbreaking animation. It raises the bar for animated films and leaves a lasting impression with its thrilling action, engaging characters, and visual splendor. This is a cinematic experience that should not be missed.","

The top-tier story telling continues, old characters return and new characters are introduced. Very well-crafted plot twists. YES, with a plural. I dont know if this story is completely original or they are following comic material, but its brilliant and ties in to the first movie. Frankly it feels more like one long story broken down into three parts, and we're smack right in the centre. The finale chapter is gonna be brilliant.Animation is returning to the spotlight. Spider-Man, Arcane, Invincible. Marvel dropped the ball on its live action but animation is carrying the legacy of comic superheroes right now.Go watch it, you will not regret.","

However, it definitely met or even surpassed my expectations. In my opinion, Spider-Verse 2 is undoubtedly a worthy successor to the first film. In fact, I believe that it's one of the best animated movies of 2023 - if not of all time.Oh and also, it's full of little hidden details and Easter eggs! I can't wait to watch it again and try to Spot more of them (pun intended).Everyone who worked on this film did an outstanding job and deserves more praise. Just incredible. No need to say more.","

"lepetitdj","5 June 2023","OK, this is not so original to say that this animation flick is a masterpiece. There must be several other users that say the same thing as I am saying.But the reason is simple: it's because it truly is!This movie left me overexcited for the last one of the trilogy. I felt like a little boy that had the best chocolate on the planet and was told that there will be more of it if I can wait until the next batch is ready. The animation is tip-top, the characters are deep and likeable, the story is fresh (relatively to the multi-verse mania that has been running the theaters lately), the action scenes are over the top and easy to follow, the epicness of the situation is increasing as the movie goes and many jokes are really funny (sometimes simple but they work in their simplicity because you let yourself go with the general mood of the film).Spiderman fans will have what they are looking for and newcomers will just have an insane experience of colors, beauty, action and emotions that very few movies are able to give, with a real message and deep thoughts about the multi-verse, destiny/determinism, family and responsibilities.So, dare I say it: this is the best movie of 2023 so far, the best animation movie of all time and one of the best films of all time, period. Just go watch it!","

On a technical and visual level, this film incorporates literally every style of animation and cinematography that is available. It is jaw dropping what has been achieved in this movie. The characters are brilliant, with perfectly selected voice actors to match.SONY really have achieved something unique here, and the animators should each be given their own award for the level of skill and attention to detail in this film.I have superhero fatigue and am tired of Multiverse plots. But all that goes out of the window, just for this film.A visual masterpiece. True art.","

"mjd8959","13 June 2023","People who are saying that they can't like this movie because it ends in a cliffhanger are silly. Plenty of books and pieces of media that are objectively and subjectively enjoyable end with cliffhangers. It's interesting because some of the people who complain about this film ending the way it did also are giving praise to Empire Strikes Back- a movie that ended in a cliffhanger. There doesn't need to be conclusion to a film to enjoy it and have fun. There's a lot of character growth, a good story, a lot of interesting ideas and the art direction is beautiful and revolutionary. There's plenty in this film to satisfy movie goers and fans alike.","

"tink-28108","29 June 2023","I loved it. From start to finish and the music. It's art really. It had really cool twists that I did not see coming (and I'm usually really good at calling those). It also has some great cameos and Easter eggs in it that I was excited to see. It does say ass quite a bit. Probably at least 3 or 4 times but that's it. We took our school so it was hard to hear it over the kids. Meaning the cuss words are well placed. As a mom, the speech that Mile's mom gave had me tearing up. I also think it's something that my three year old would enjoy. So it's definitely family friendly (unless you're super strict about cuss words.)","

You crave for more, we all deserve the end but, that 9 months wait will be worth the wait.This will be perfect than the endgame.

You will understand the decisions that were made to be where it is now.You are just trying to feed into your brain wanting things to have closure, the satisfaction of your time invested.Fear not, March 2024 will satisfy that even more.As for the movie, I can't stop thinking about it any less. Even after 2nd watch, I want to go few more times to enjoy only in theaters. Your brain gets happy with that art you are being able to witness in such an adorable cost.Appreciate everyone involved in this movie, appreciate the animators, appreciate the sound designers and to the writers.9.5.","

"jascoward","2 July 2023","The first Spiderverse film was excellent. Everything worked like a charm. Sometimes we have to choose between amazing special effects and a good story with strong character growth. Every now and again you get a film on the level with Roger Rabbit.Out of this trilogy, they have already given us two magnificent story's. It's like Toy Story where you are in awe of the visual presentation. People like me appreciate when you can see the heart and hard work on the screen. Apparently some studios believe throwing absurd amounts of 💸 at the production crew and a good movie will just suddenly appear. When you hire artists with a vision and a passion to inspire the crew to believe in the magic being conjured, then a quality film appears. Life is hard all over and it is a blessing when they give us a product we can treasure. I know the pressure is at 💯%, but I pray they get what they need to finish this partial masterpiece.","

"yeswestan","25 August 2023","I was a HUGE fan of the first movie. I went into it expecting the multiple spider-people to be confusing and overwhelming and left the theatre a new person. I bought the art book. I studied the style. I wrote about this franchise in my college application essays.And to now see that the animation has only improved just blows me away. I see how the filmmakers adapted the praise and excitement about the animation and colors and cranked it up; this movie is somehow more beautiful than the last. The comedy is excellent. The soundtrack is engaging and creative. The cast of characters and background spider-people only drive the point further that anyone can be spider-man with the level of diversity among them. The writing and dialogue is just amazing, the cast is wonderful, and the conflict feels real and devastating.The only real negatives I can think of are that it was kind of a lot/messy, and it sucks that this movie was split into two; that makes it feel like the story was only just getting started before it suddenly stopped.This film truly shows what animation is capable of. All the elements come together so well.And lastly, I'm Indian. So seeing Pavitr Prabhakar on the big screen not only representing the Indian community, but also our culture in a way that was fun and relatable made me so happy. I understand that the movie serves more of a base-level view on Indian culture but seeing as the movie isn't really about that, I think they did a good job, especially with the entire Mumbattan environment. I loved every second of it. People don't realize how much representation matters. I'm grateful.","

Multiverse have already given Marvel infinite options to go with , In this movie they have utilized it wisely. As an Indian I am hyped to see Pavitr Prabhakar in this movie. He also spiced things up in the movie. Miguel O'Hara also known as the Spiderman 2099 made lots of impact in the movie. As the movie progressed more and more suspense was revealed which were all goosebumps moments, especially the climax. Earth 42 is going to offer lot more in the next movie and I am so excited to watch it. Love the whole movie , eagerly waiting for spiderman beyond the spider verse. Hope the next movie will be a Blast.","

Now, admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of marvel movies in general, but I do know that the ones that I've watched, couldn't even come close to the masterpiece that is this movie. The jokes were funny, the serious parts were amazing and made sense, and the designs of the characters are the most creative designs I've ever seen in any animated movie. The villain of the movie is also very interesting, and along with having a comedic backstory along with bouncing off of the rest of the spider-mens humor, is scary and serious. Amazing movie overall, and I'm very excited to see Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse Part 2.","

"carsonpayne-66437","3 June 2023","For only the 16th time ever, this movie gets a perfect 10/10 from me. How come? Without a doubt, Across the Spider-Verse has done something that is completely new and original while still be a sequel to a previous film.I can not imagine a single person going to see this movie and not absolutely loving it. First off, the movie is visually stunning. Each frame is a work of art while the film switches from art styles at rapid pace without distracting from the story in any way. The writers were much more bold and complex with the story this time around and it most definitely paid off. I was engaged in the storyline of every single character and could not stop imagining what a film about each person could be like. Finally, the sound was absolutely absurd! I could not believe at some points how fantastic the visuals and sound meshed together to bring the film to life.Across the Spider-Verse benefits heavily from its predecessor. With a lot less explaining needing to go on about character backstories, the whole film was an adventure and I am here for it. Even when things were needed to be explained, like the multiverse, it was done so beautifully and well. Easily the best multiverse movie that has come out and there have been many.Do yourself a favor and go watch this on the biggest screen near you. This is not something you want to miss seeing in theaters.","

Every frame looks like a Van Gogh, a Picasso. It makes Into the Spider-Verse look like a first grader painted it. The voice cast is very well done, Oscar Isaac, Haliee Steinfeld, and Andy Samberg are definite highlights. The action sequences are superb, but they complement a fantastic story that when its massive cliffhanger hits you, you'll be begging for more. Daniel Pemberton brings his A game once again with a score that's even better than the first. Across the Spider-Verse succeeds in every way, and should be seen on the biggest screen possible.","

I loved the focus on family, relationships, multiple cultures, throwbacks to other Spiderman movies, some unpredictable twists, action, and the varying types of animation. Most superhero movies seem to be heavy on action and weak on character relationships so it was refreshing to see this movie firmly deliver in this area. I was skeptical at the 9/10 IMDB rating but, I was wrong for that. Its a 10/10!!! I was traveling when it came out and was disappointed to see it pulled feom the IMAX and Dolby Cinema screens after the first weekend. I was lucky to find one cinema on June 23.","

"ruelshepperd","3 June 2023","Into The Spider-Verse was one of the best superhero movies and animated movies ever made, certainly the strongest Spider-Man movie we've had to date. Until now. Across The Spider-Verse takes all what was great about its predecessor and turns it up to 11, creating what is possibly the best animated movie ever.The animation in this film is next level. The style has evolved since the last film with not only the comic-style but many different styles encompassing different versions of Spider-Man and it all flows together marvellously. Every frame is literally an excellently constructed painting. This aids in the absolutely stunning and immensely creative action sequences, some of the best I've ever seen.The story is once again fantastic. With all this multiversal madness, the writers put Miles' story front and centre. His arc is remarkable and Shameik Moore continues to be the definitive version of the character. Every voice actor does an incredible job, especially Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Every moment of the pair together is wonderful. There is so much going on character-wise and Miles' personal journey has the potential to be the best Spider-Man story arc we've gotten in movie form.Being a big crossover, there are moments of fan service but they're never dwelt upon, the plot and characters remain the focus. If there were any problems to bring up it would be that the main antagonist for the first half of the film disappears for the rest of the film but the villain is still good and is clearly going to be more prevalent in the next film. There is still very strong emotional conflict without him as strong character ideals become the main source of conflict for the rest of the film.Overall, this film should be a 10/10 but because of its place as the first of a two-parter, the second part must stick the landing for it all to be worth it. However, I have immense faith in the filmmakers to pull it off because of the immense quality of this film. It exceeds in all aspects of filmmaking. A must-see for everyone!","

"curmudgeon86","2 October 2023","Into the Spider-Verse was one of the rare big studio movies that felt fresh, authentic and full of heart. Across the Spider-Verse falls short of matching its predecessor in each of those counts.Whenever a superhero movie succeeds, big studios try to distill its essence down to a formula, trim out any creative risks to make it safe for large-scale public consumption and add some fanservice. This is the case with the second instalment of Spider-verse.Except for the art. The art was brilliant and original. But little else stays with you after after the end.On a side note, is anyone else tired of multiverses? In the first movie, spider-beings from different dimensions were fresh and funny. Twenty popular movies and series later, it feels played out. The central plot feels like something out of an old Rick and Morty episode.But the bigger problem was this: the essence of Spider Man stories is that he is both a teenager and a superhero. He has typical teenager problems, struggles to juggle his double life, makes mistakes and learns from them. The first half of the movie followed that template and was good fun to watch.But then the movie turns it upside down and the teens become smarter than the adults. The adult Spider folks in Spider HQ(which was basically Citadel of Ricks from R&M) not only approach a sensitive conversation with Miles with the delicacy of a sledgehammer, it's unclear if they even know what they are talking about.The centrepiece of the movie is an extended chase scene with little suspense about the result. Here's another thing that annoys me: making your hero suddenly overpowered by having them beat other characters in a way that defies in-universe logic.The English punk spiderman made me chuckle though.","

The second part to the Spidey-Verse was beautifully crafted with mesmerizing animation effects and a fantastic screenplay. I don't want to give too much details because I don't want to play spoiler and second so much goes on into the film. You have to watch it twice. Whether you're a fan of Toby M, Andrew G, or Tom H Spider-Man's version. This Miles Morales version doesn't disappoint. As a fan of the cinematic world, it's not often an animated film gets high praise. However, Across the Spider-Verse, is a animated movie to be recognize.","

"boblipton","11 June 2023","Before I begin my review, WARNING! This is the first of a two-part movie. I don't mind two-parters, but I do resent finding out at the end.That said, when we begin this movie, we discover Miles Morales down in the dumps. True, he has just saved the multiverse, but he's a lonely neighborhood Spiderman, with his fellow spidermen (and women) off in their own versions of the Earth. However, when a villain called the Spot shows up, proclaiming himself Spiderman's nemesis, taking umbrage at being called the villain of the week, and Gwen Stacey's Spiderwoman shows up, Miles finds himself tagging along to discover a multiverse of Spidermen, Spiderwoman, Spidercats, Spiderbabies, and even a Spider Tyrannosaurus Rex, banded together to defend all reality.... and he's not welcome.Once again there are clever gags, every universe is drawn in a different style, and there is a clear metaphorical meaning to this: events may compel us into certain paths, making us seem no more than an expression of a trope, but who we are makes a difference in the outcome, too. The visual splendor of this movie makes it one you should see, if you are interested, in the theater. Even though I am annoyed at having a two-parter slipped past me without warning.","

"eddie_baggins","1 June 2023","Not even the most optimistic of pundits could've ever predicted the glowing reception and success that came the way of 2018's Into the Spider-Verse, slinging to almost $400 million at the worldwide box office, critical praise and a spot entrenched in the upper echelons of the IMDB's Top 250 Movies of All Time list, too say that the first iteration of the Spider-Verse animated universe was a roaring and unexpected success would be a huge understatement.Fast forward these close to 5 years on and expectations for teenager Miles Morales/Spider-Man next adventure are sky high but proving that lightning can strike twice, the creative team behind this colourful Spider-Man series overseen by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have once again delivered a frenetic, energetic and most importantly entertaining animated epic that will likely cause much debate as to whether or not this is a case of a rare sequel that may in fact be better than its forefather.Still featuring the oddball humour and near endless parade of in-jokes, homages and side gags that made the first Morales venture such a delight outside of its visual spectacle, Across the Spider-Verse also feels like a much more mature outing this time around, with Morales himself more world weary and battered, coinciding with the film as a whole dealing with some heavy issues and subject matters that at times brings on an unexpectedly sombre tone, with credit going to the creative team here for not being afraid to make their film skew further from the young audience that may not quite understand the nuances on display here all the while allowing older audience members to feast on a film that is far from all style and no substance.Clocking in at close to two and a half hours, Across the Spider-Verse is one of the longest animated films ever widely released into cinemas and there are segments throughout the film where it feels as though we are covering off similar narrative ground on more than one occasion but when Morales adventure into the Multiverse swings into the sky it takes us on an often unforgettable journey, whether it be to a New York done the way of Mumbai or a Spider-filled version of Earth, Across the Spider-Verse has enough imagination and spark to fill countless other animated rides that would be desperate for even a portion of the creative magic on display here.As also was the case the first time around in 2018, this 2023 Spider-Verse features another array of on-song voice performances from its talented cast that works in tandem with the incredible artistry on display throughout, led once more by Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld, new additions to the voice cast here such as a scene-stealing Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara, Jason Schwartzman as The Spot or Daniel Kaluuya as Hobart Brown all bring their A-game to this big budgeted affair, making this an all-round package that has not only lived up to the legacy of the first instalment but arguably surpassed it.Even if there's a feeling of being teased by possibilities once the credits begin to roll here, the hype is going to be overflowing for next years Beyond the Spider-Verse which is setting out to prove that lightning can indeed strike more than twice.Final Say -People may bemoan the amount of Spider-Man themed films we've had slung our way over the past 20 years but if the quality of these outings remains as strong as what we get here with Across the Spider-Verse, they're going to be complaining for a long time yet to come.4 Chai tea's out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","

"somekidzenvy","6 June 2023","I loved this movie. It was so well written and have just about everyone shining. It takes a complicated concept like the multiverse and actually tells it in a way anyone can understand and actually explore different types of universes.Gwen is shown struggling, vulnerable, yet still strong and confident. Miles isn't a side show in his own movie either even though we finally see Miguel take stage. They set this up for a sequel and I was honestly ready for another 2 hours when this ended.Just like the first movie, the soundtrack goes with the scenes and add to the feel. I grew up in NYC, and this really took me back. BRAVO!!","

"TheDanishMovie-Nerd","12 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' achieves something extraordinary, not only in the realm of animated superhero cinema, but in the broader landscape of film. It transcends boundaries, merging art, narrative, and emotional depth into an awe-inspiring spectacle that stuns in every frame.This movie doesn't merely satisfy, it surpasses expectations and redefines the creative frontier.

The depiction of his relationships - with family, friends, and even himself - are as authentic as they are affecting.The narrative arc of Miles Morales strikes a chord because of its universal appeal. It is a tale of growing up, finding one's path, and navigating life's trials, albeit through the lens of a multiverse-traveling teenage superhero.

"tokoroos","25 June 2023","I want to have this movie in my home, right now. So I can watch it a few more times. As I watched in the cinema, I got emotional of how beautiful this movie is. Everytime Gwen's storyline came up, I got goosebumps. The backgrounds fits every character perfectly. It's freaking funny, it's good for nerds and non-nerds, there's a lot of depth and emotion in it. Various life stages are touched in this movie. From teenager to parent. From puppy love to hardcore grief.When the movie ended the audience sighed. Nooo we want moooore. And I will wait patiently for more of this beautiful artpiece. If the third one is half as good as this one, it's still the best series in the history of film.","

Each character is intriguing and worth the building.The story is strong and it out does the original. The addition of Spiderman 2099; just genius.A fun ride from beginning to end, where everything is multidimensional and thought provoking.In a year blockbusters are rare, this is a pure pleasure for movie goers. Fans of spiderman will be pleased. Fans of superhero movies will be pleased. Fans of just movies will be pleasantly surprised how intelligent this movie really is.A pure delight.","

"kosmasp","3 June 2023","No puns intended - and yes it is plural! So many things that are touched upon .. same is true for the movie. There is so much, that watching this once is not enough. While it has been a while since I saw the first (or rather previous) movie, it is not entirely necessary to have seen it. On the other hand, you will have some callbacks, if you have seen it. Maybe even more if you watch them back to back.The character are well drawn (no pun here, not an entirely intended one at least) - and talking of drawn: I remember that the first movie had one style throughout the movie. This combines many styles (and universes/worlds) ... which suits the movie well. You have so many characters (some returning, but also quite a few new ones) .. and you have the old ones ""evolving"" to a degree. Still stuck - still trying to handle their situation, still struggling with having a ""normal"" life and being the superhero their city deserves (well let's assume that is the case).Cameos are here - and this is all over the place (ok that can be found guilty of being a pun) - we get references of so many things. Me not being as familiar as other when it comes to Spiderman comics ... I assume there are even more in jokes here that I was not able to comprehend or even detect. Twists are here to stay and the trailer did not really give away too much - so no finger pointing (I had to - as did the movie).Dialog is great - and quite fast paced! It does not leave you with room to breathe ... but it is tight and it works. And it also is helping that the voice cast is as good as one can imagine. The multiverse is here to stay - or you know switch around, fighting the good fight ... what I did not know: the movie is only part of a larger story ... so do not be surprised if the movie leaves you wanting more at the end ... to quote the movie: to be continued (thankfully the sequel is coming next year)","

"nathanielkalatsky","8 June 2023","This movie is not what I expected. Like Morbius the trailers were very misleading, but in the best way possible. Morbius' trailer thankfully hid the parts about him morbing so it could be a surprise. Every event in this trailer happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie. After that the chai comes. Spiderman india is the hero of this movie. He introduces the chai tea or should I say tea tea, and he is the one who saves the day. There are so many jokes about Chai and it is very dramatic when miles drowns in Chai. Some of the jokes can be very rude to chai lovers. Its all in good fun though. Luckily one spiderverse bought spiderman india's chai and they all said chai tea at the same time. It annoyed the Chai monster villain who knew they were saying tea tea. While he was distracted spidermanindia drank him. Like how lego dimensions is the best lego game spiderman spiderverse is the best movie. I cant wait for morb. I also had got some chai tea while i was watching the movie. I love chai tea. I was very insulted at some parts despite the positives, but luckily I had chai to keep me entertained. I love chai. The actual story was definitly lacking however. I also think a lot of the themes could have been handled better. Miles should have probably gotten more focus which I wasn't thinking about before because I love chai. I actually would not recommend this movie. You should only see this movie if you love chai and you are drinking it while watching the movie. Actually don't watch the movie at all because it will insult any chai lovers out there. Overall following a great first movie, unfortunatly the sequel was very bad. Writing review is my passion.","

"Jf12345","26 June 2023","As a fan of Spiderman, I really enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse because it has the best plot supported by amazing visual effects which make this movie a godsend, a masterpiece. While watching this movie, I don't even realise it is a 2 hours 16 mins movie.Good:
Firstly, extraordinary animation. It not just kept the animation style of Into the spider verse, but it also expanded what they did in the first film. They boldly adopted a variety of different visual effects of the scenes. It uses six different animation styles to portray and create new universes whereas Into the Spider-Verse only used one. I can truly say that its animation sublimates the plot of the storyline in this movie. It is worth waiting for 5 years to watch this movie!!!!! Every scene every second is extraordinary. And this movie is not skimping on providing high quality animation with charming animation styles, also putting massive easter eggs for the audiences to dig for them.Secondly, the casts perfectly adopted characters. Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld give their best performance to make their own characters more attractive and trigger my emotions to care about these characters. In my opinion, I am very obsessed with the character of Miguel O'Hara. Oscar Isaac brings an amazing performance to show Miguel O'Hara's helplessness, determination to stop Miles and insistence on doing what he thinks is right. I don't even think that he is the villain, he is just a person who doesn't want Miles to go through what he experienced before.Thirdly, the sensational plot. The movie smartly chooses to build up the background of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy instead of just putting action scenes in the first act. It is efficient step by step to build up the characteristics of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy to let the audiences know what they care for. The audiences will keep on immersing in this film while watching.Bad
If I must say the bad of this movie, I would say that the story is not completed in part 1. Some movies separated the story plot into 2 parts to let the characters gather their strength for a final confrontation in the sequel such as ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Infinite War"". For these movies, they are great because the characters have completed something and the rest of the story will be resolved in the sequel. For example, the Rebel Alliance flees from the Empire in ""Empire Strikes Back"" and Thanos successfully cuts down half of the population in the universe after he snaps his finger in ""Infinity War"". However, ""Across the spider verse"" seems like the first and second act of the story. The movie doesn't not give any answer to resolve the story and the story questions still exist until the end of this film.In conclusion, I strongly recommend you watch this movie as much as you would. And you should watch the movie with the bigger screen. Remarkable animation, amazing story plot and sensational characters build the masterpiece and it deserves you to spend the time to watch it again and again.","

"masonsaul","3 June 2023","From its very first opening moments, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an undeniable work of art. A bigger, bolder sequel that's not afraid to take its time with its character's growth and truly understands the character. Exploring in extremely meta, reality bending fashion the true burden of being Spider-Man.Shameik Moore is once again perfect, he's able to portray how Miles has grown since the first film effortlessly and remains loveable. Hailee Steinfeld is even better than last time with the best arc of the film, its just as much her film as it is Miles. Jason Schwartzman is great as the Spot, able go from being a joke to a genuine threat in really convincing fashion.Out of the new Spider-people, Oscar Isaac brings a palpable anger to Miguel O'Hara that conveys the burden he has and the lengths he'll go to and Daniel Kaluuya is the best new addition as Hobie, an unashamedly British character with the strongest moral compass and never betrays it, making him an easy favourite.In the years since the original came out, a fair few films have clearly been inspired by its animation and put their own spin on it but directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Justin K. Thompson and Kemp Powers do an excellent job of reminding you nothing can compete with Spider-verse. Its the literal definition of every frame a painting and every new dimension is so vibrant and unique.The soundtrack and score by Daniel Pemberton remain highlights, maintaining a strong balance between the two but Pemberton has really outdone himself with this score. It brings back all the themes that were so unique and memorable whilst adding new ones that are equally strong, if not better.","

"Seb_3","9 December 2023","Another outstanding spectacle filled with depth, character building, emotion, while delivering top notch animation through the entire run time.It uses nostalgia and other funny quirks, for the viewers to take notice of and have a laugh at. Despite that it isn't driven by those aspects, but instead the characters and story. Where the first movie felt like a conclusive origin story about Miles Morales, this instead feels like an expansion of the universe and the beginning of a larger tale.In the end it feels very much like the first part of two, and I can't wait for the second half. That being said, the story still has a but not as conclusive as the first one. Its a bigger and more expansive story, about Miles' journey about what it means to be Spiderman and the responsibility that follows.","

"manasbhati","1 June 2023","They somehow managed to top almost every aspect of the first film. An extraordinary display of what animation is capable of. They're just showing off at this point...I guess the one thing that's worse than the first film is the plot. However, unlike the first one, Across the Spider-Verse exists to create a grand setup for the final film, and boy, it does that really well. Still can't beat the personal journey of Miles in the first movie though.Plus Daniel Pemberton's music is as good as ever. Each one of his themes used in the first film are thrown into overdrive here, and the brand new themes he introduces aren't too shabby.","

"pranayjalvi","4 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse looks incredible, even better than the groundbreaking first installment, but what's truly impressive about it is how willing it is to entrust its storytelling to its animation. There's not a frame of this rich, kaleidoscopically detailed animation that isn't dazzling.Across the Spider-Verse isn't just mind-bending spectacle - although it definitely dazzles in every frame. It's mind-bending spectacle in service of a thrilling story about a teenager facing the horrifying possibility that he can't fix everything. Undoubtedly this has gotta be the best of 2023 and we are gonna get the solution of the cliffhanger that Across the Spider-Verse has stranded us in.My Rating : 10/10.","

"vinniec-53536","6 June 2023","In 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse', the follow-up to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse', we catch up with Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he tries his best to juggle his responsibilities as a student and son alongside his role as Brooklyn's one-and-only Spider-Man. However, when a new villain called The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) emerges and fellow spider-powered hero Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) unexpectedly returns, our friendly neighborhood wall-crawler embarks on an adventure that takes him way out of his neighborhood. In the same vein as such classic sequels as 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight', 'Across the Spider-Verse' tells a darker, more mature story than its predecessor, while still retaining much of the heart and humor that made it so beloved. While the film contains quite a few pretty heavy moments, there are also some wholesome, endearing ones as well, creating a nice balance. Revelations are revealed that give more depth to Miles and Gwen, and we see them make tough decisions that perfectly reflect who they are as characters. Some intriguing new players are introduced as well, such as the anti-establishment Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya) and the no-nonsense Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac), that add additional layers and perspectives to the story. The latter in particular creates a unique dilemma for Miles that no 15-year-old should have to face. The film also does a terrific job of taking a villain who starts out as an unintimidating joke and turns him into a terrifying threat by the end. While Miles himself is always a delight to watch, Gwen stole the show for me this time. She has a much bigger role than she did in 'Into the Spider-Verse' and takes her well-deserved place in the spotlight alongside Miles as essentially co-lead. With all that said, the film's biggest strength is absolutely its revolutionary visuals. 'Across the Spider-Verse' brilliantly blends multiple animation styles into a dazzling four-course feast for the eyeballs, so much so that as I went to sleep that night I was still trying to process everything I'd seen. From the beautiful environments to the mind-blowing action sequences to the characters themselves, every single shot in this movie is downright entrancing. In conclusion, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is unlike anything I've ever experienced. It's a true masterpiece of comic-book movies, of animation, and of filmmaking in general. The bar has been raised. Other studios, take notes: this is how it's done.","

"TheMysteriousReviewer","14 August 2023","I will be honest, it will be debatable to pick either this or Into The Spider-Verse that's the better. But either way, it truly blew me away. Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is not just among the best Spider-Man movie, but also one of the best animated superhero movie ever created next to The Incredibles. It has exceeded to the expectations people wanted with an exciting story that takes the Spider-Verse to a whole new level, top notch animation, unforgettable characters that has given more personalities to get us to know old and new, intense action, and one of the most shocking cliffhangers since The Empire Strikes Back. To fans of the first film, Spider-Man fans, superhero fans, and even fans of movies, this is the movie I think you are truly gonna enjoy. I really encourage to check it out. After watching this myself, this already got me excited for Beyond The Spider-Verse and hopefully it will give us a perfect ending to all this. I have no idea when that movie is going to come out. But when it does, let's go over this one more time.","

And maybe the best marvel movie too. Coming from a die hard DC fan ive enjoyed every single second of this movie. Visually its just marvellous. The animation style is unique. Even better than the first one. Story, tone, phasing , comedy and emotional weight is perfectly balanced. Last but not least the MUSIC. The music gave me literal chills all the way through. Ive never heard that much great music in any other comic based movie. Just perfect . Next thing is all the homage to old spidey movies, cartoons and comic books. Just well done. I hope one day ill be lucky enough to see a DC animated movie as good as this. Cant wait to see the next part.","

"vithiet","20 August 2023","I absolutely love the first one and the fact I know so many people who are not into animated movies or comics who also found it great is a testament to its quality. So I went in this second chapter optimistically hoping they wouldn't mess up trying to emulate the first one; I certainly didn't think it would be equally good. And to my utmost surprise it's actually... better. It surpasses it in every way: the visuals of course but also the depth of the story and the writing that goes along, voice acting of course, terrific score, and just overall directing. 2.5 hours just went like that *snaps fingers* and since I didn't know it was planned to be a trilogy I let out a very loud ""Noooooo!"" when the words To Be Continued appeared as it felt like I was only 30 minutes in. If Beyond the Spider-verse ends up being as good (or dare I say it... better?) this will go down as one of the most perfect and impressive trilogies ever made. Oh yeah, highly recommended, in case that wasn't clear haha.","

It is absolutely fantastic in every way a I would say even more so than its predecessor, which was already a 10/10 film.

"jius","2 June 2023","Don't write many reviews, but this film deserves every bit of it's 10/10 score. The film pulls you in with the crispiest animation images I've seen on the big screen - you seriously cannot watch this on a home TV screen to give it justice. Beautiful colours and sequences it leaves you in awe. The score and soundtrack is amazing and is like the glue that binds the images together and feels very much part of the feel and story - not just some random celeb hits added as an afterthought.The excellent script with its qwerks, twists, jokes and heart felt moments just capture you attention non-stop, that you don't have time to even contemplate how time has passed in the real world. I've watch Disney and other animation stuff checking watch or phone waiting for the end, but not one bit in this movie. It truly captures your attention from beginning to end.The cast are very well put together with each voice and actor just giving fantastically to the story in their unique ways.I went to watch on a non-cheap night at the cinema with the whole family and it's the first film in a long long time that I didn't feel a bit robbed and actually came out so glad my little monetary contribution has gone into the film for cast and crew. They have done a fantastic job. It is by far the best Spiderman film in all areas.It seriously is a must watch!","

But that's absolutely alright, I wouldn't have liked if a movie of over 4 hours end quickly (since that thing happens in theatres all the time). I wish I could watch this movie for the first time again and again, because it's that amazing.Conclusion : If you haven't already watched this, just go to the nearest freaking hall and watch it already!!

"krzysiektom","16 June 2023","I'm on the fence about it. Split into two scores. One is very, very high: the music score and soundtrack. Amazing! 10 out of 10 for me. The other score is weak: the movie itself. I find the story , direction, animation and the voices very mediocre. For children mostly. The script is very predictable, yet confusing at the same time. The amazing music score kept my attention till the end, were it not for the music I suspect I'd be bored. I'm not a fan of comics in general and I'm not a child. Only 2 out of 10 for me. So, I add the score of 10 and the score of 2, and divide it in half. I give the movie 6 stars.","

"Silver5963","22 December 2023","I don't think I've been this bored in cinema for a while. This felt longer and more dragged out than three hours of Oppenheimer. I mean, Zack Snyder's Justice League felt less dragged out than this.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is easily the most overrated film of 2023 I've seen (I didn't see Barbie but part of me wishes I'd seen that instead).Rave all you want about the visuals but staring at those visuals for 2.5 hours on a large cinema screen soon becomes an eyesore.I have a minor personal gripe with Spider-Punk. Mostly because where I'm from in England, everybody tries to emulate the language and mannerisms of Hobie because they ""think it's cool"". It's not.The lack of Spider-Noir and Spider-Ham was felt too and that kinda knocks it down a bit.Spider-Man 2099 was incredibly predictable as a character. I don't get the hype there at all. So he's an edgy, unfunny Spider-Man, so what? He felt relatively flat in terms of character.Props where it's due, they did a great job turning The Spot into a genuine threat and not just a villain of the week. They should've focussed more on his part of the story instead of the Spider-Council side. Additionally, Indian Spider-Man was probably the best new addition in this film, as he seemed genuinely likeable and had a fun and unique vibe.The final act of this film dragged on for what felt like an hour in itself, throwing one plot twist, followed by another, then a cliffhanger but wait, there's more! Two more cliffhangers later and it's finally over. Pacing issues were prominent.And my final point, which is more of a personal preference really, but Miles Morales just isn't as good as Peter Parker. He's nowhere near as compelling and certainly not as iconic. When you say ""Spider-Man"" the default name is Peter Parker for a reason. This isn't exactly the worst Spider-Man film but No Way Home did multiversal Spider-Men better and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1 and 2 sweep them all.It shocks me that at one point this film was #3 on IMDb's Top 250 films because in no reality should it be a canon event that this film ranks higher than The Dark Knight. I'm hoping in the future people will rewatch this film, realise it's not all that, and the undeserved 8.6/10 rating drops lower.","

"marwinsingh-30063","4 June 2023","Spider man across the spider verse is one the best movies based on comic books i've ever seen.. It had everything I've ever dreamed of as a Spider Man fan... From groundbreaking visuals to unique animation to colorfull different universes to awesome soundtrack with decent action scenes and a great story it has everything you need from a comic book movie.. It looks like an comic book comes to life.. Set after 1yr of previous film this film explores Miles Morales's character of Spider Man and also expand on the character of Gwen Stacy/ Spider Woman.. I always wanted to see Spider Man 2099 and my wish got true with this film.. The scene where entire Spider society chase Miles Morales is highlight of this movie and will become iconic in future.. Seeing hundreds of different versions of Spider Man such as Scarlet Spider, Spider Punk, Spider Man Unlimited, Spider Man India, Ps4 Spider Man, Spider Man 2000, Spectacular Spider Man, Lego Spider Man etc in a single scene was feast to the eyes and satisfaction to the soul.. Story wise it was also amazing filled with many dramatic elements to scenes of full thrill and suspense with some comedy was amazing to experience.. Color palette of this movie is unique each universe has a different vibe to it.. Even though I don't watch many animated movies I can proudly say my love for Spider Man leads me to a theatre and gave me an once in a lifetime opportunity to experience this on a big screen.. Can't wait for next installment and very excited to see how this universe will grow from here.. Every comic book lover should see this film in theater and die hard fans of Spider man can't miss this one.. It gave me same experience I got with Spider Man No Way Home.... Can't wait to see what happens next since it ended on a cliffhanger.. Kids will love this film for sure and adults with also enjoy this... Best animated movie ever... 10/10 highly recommend. Thank you Sony Pictures for bringing us Spider Verse on big screen I'll be forever in the debt... 🕷 🕸 ❤","

But it surpassed my expectations in an excellent way. This is the magnum opus of all animation in my opinion. It just combines so many different styles in one coherent movie, with an excellent story, cast and performances. I really was disappointed by the huge cliffhanger in the end, in a good way. Definitely going to rewatch this movie very soon, there are so many layers to this movie. In my opinion you can't fully appreciate what's on screen with just one watch, you need to see it multiple times to really let it sink in. This is definitely a highlight of the movies I watched this year so far.","

Eventually, the MCU stopped having stakes. It stopped havj G characters. It just became a succession of adverts for the next movie in the sequence of exhausting cookie cutter same old same old adverts for the next movie.What is obviously now going to be the spider verse trilogy, has for lack of a better word, soul.If you want to go in assuming it's empty spectacle, it can deliver in spades, entertaining and colourful, gorgeous at every second. If you want a story of found family, acceptance, love, stuggling to be your best self, it's there. But if you scratch just a little deeper, you find a scathing metatextual commentary on the destructive rigidity of canon. You find a biting social commentary on the dynamics of power, institutionalised bigotry and othering.You find, an actual damn story.Not just Generic Hero Man or Woman saves the CGI world from Generic Baddie Man or Woman, end credits sting for next film. Not just bland nothings serving up the next bland nothing ad infinitum.An actual story. A modern day fable designed to ask questions, designed to mean something beneath all the superheroic trappings. A fun romp that actually bothers to try and mean something in a genre bereft of any meaning.This is what a comic book, super hero movie, should be. Accept nothing less.","

of course not!The movie has PERFECT animation, with the best and most varied traits, in an incredibly fluid and full of life way.References and easter-eggs for Spidey fans are everywhere!That is, the film is also perfect in fan service ...In its plot, we learn a great question of what is right and wrong with arachnids.And even with little participation, Mayday Parker is TOO CUTE. (not a spoiler, the baby is in the trailer)Anyway, compliments to the voice acting and soundtrack, nothing I'm going to point out mistakes, I'd say that things about them can be improved... but the way they are, they're great!","

"BenW1999","1 June 2023","A good film, but very overhyped.A loud gasp of disappointment went across the entire 400+ seated cinema. Many people saying it was ""sh!t"" and ""nothing happened"" and ""that was the deadest film""... and I partially agree.While an overall enjoyable film from my perspective, giving it an 8/10, critics have misled audiences AGAIN and set us up for disappointment. Not much...actually happens.We have a very VERY tedius 30ish minute intro and recap to all the characters we already know about, telling us everything we already know about Gwen and Miles, dragging out the runtime. There's no proper villain in the film either, we get a splatter of a few villains throughout, and one will obviously be a bigger villain in the third film, but... yeah...I sort of agree with the people complaining.I did find this more enjoyable than Guardians of the galaxy Vol 3, but its not the masterpiece 10/10 the paid critics give it.","

"clydekaila-04310","10 August 2023","""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" does an incredible, if not, amazing job of keeping the audience totally immersed in the story. With a perfect balance of telling and showing with its unmatched comic like animation, fresh and free flowing dialogue with undertones of humor and seriousness alike (achieving a perfect mix, adding to the story with cinematic aspects amplifying tone), outstanding street and abstract art and coloring along with beautiful cinematic lighting alike and masterful storytelling seamlessly completing the character arc of even the newer characters, hooking viewers deeper and deeper into the story unraveling every level (there's so many levels to this. Not to much. Just right. Oh soo good!) with every scene or sequence of scenes and act along with the totally insane and literally out-of-this-world action sequences and effortlessly engaging sound scape. A total must-see. A masterclass in storytelling and digital animation. Absolutely Brilliant in every way. Huge thanks to the Directors, Producers, Writers, Animators and Sound scape teams and Actors. Absolutely CANNOT wait for Beyond The Spider-Verse.","

"grantlauzon","2 June 2023","Best TV show this year. The writings great the visuals are stunning and at 2hours 20minutes I wish I could continue bingeing it. This is effectively Part 1 of the sequel to Into the Spider-Verse.The massive world(s) is(are) explained and explored at a beautiful pace that doesn't feel too beat you over the head expositiony.The first Spiderverse had a relatively small budget of 90million which it used to great effect. This movie looks like it has a 200million dollar budget. It's actually only 100million but with their experience from the first movie they've made great strides in squeezing beauty out of dollars especially when accounting for inflation.Across the Sider-Verse is the Tears of The Kingdom to Into the Spider-Verse's Breath of the Wild.","

"Mangalassery_Neelakandan","5 June 2023","One of the best if not the best spiderman movies out there. Mahn what a journey it was, the story, the score, the action sequences, the pace everything was top notch. For me this move is right there with no way home & spiderman 2. It had all the references in the world and that was really a fan treat. From the pointing meme, to the iconic scenes it was a total package.The animation style like in the first movie was the main highlight, the comic book like animation along with the fast changing frames was great, but some portions need to be paused to read what all are written there as it was there only for like a frame or two, but still, the effort they took just to animate a single frame and put that much detail on it is just epic.This dealt with multiverse more than the multiverse of madness, it showed every spiderman that can be shown in a 140 min film, the main leads, Miles, Gwen, Peter, Miguel, spider-women, spider man india, everyone had their own space in the film.If i kept on going there will be lot of spoilers so, keeping it simple, this is a must watch film for all spidey fans, the cliffhanger ending made this movie even special for me as i kept on wondering that they would rush a climax just for the sake of it, also there is no mid, or end credit scene, waited in the theater for atleast 5 minutes but there was nothing at all.","

I cannot explain anything that hasn't been already told by everyone, critics and fans alike: the animation, the story-line, the soundtrack, the action scenes... everything is perfect and calculated even to the last detail. So polished, so carefully prepared. When the end of the film hit, I was ready to watch one more hour of the story, so it leaves you wanting, asking for more. In a 2 hour movie that is a tremendous achievement.I enjoyed it like a child and I could watch it several times more until the final part releases, which has a very difficult bar to reach, by the way.","

"Vivekmaru45","11 August 2023","A simple Spider-Man cartoon. Can't you just make a simple Spider-man cartoon like the ones we saw during Stan Lee's early career. I'm talking about the 1967-1981. The 1981 Spider-Man cartoons were the best: a bridge between the old and new.Then we had the relatively good 1990 Spider-Man animated series. What I've just listed are the best along with the live action first three Spider-Man movies starring Nicholas Hammond: Spider-Man 1977, Spider-Man Strikes Back 1978 and Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge 1981. Tears fall from my eyes as I recollect watching Spider-Man 1977 shown to us by our teacher in playschool. I was a little nipper but the Spider-Man character stuck in my memory and later reinforced by the 1981 cartoons I used to see in the afternoon after school.How people forget Nicholas Hammond was the first and best actor to play Spider-Man. Like John Wesley Shipp who played The Flash in the 1990 series. Truth is that the film industry wants you to forget these people ever existed. It is quite a shame that John Wesley Shipp who looks strikingly like Bruce Campbell never rose to fame. Indeed I would have like these two to star alongside each other in a Sam Raimi directed movie.Plot of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman across the multiverse where he meets a team of Spider-People known as the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O'Hara/ Spider-Man 2099, but comes into conflict with them over handling a new threat in the form of the Spot.Verdict: just watched about 30 minutes and couldn't handle any more of it. Ironically I thought the previous installment made in 2018 was a much coherent plot and worth watching. Also I'm a staunch supporter of the original 1967 Peter Parker character created by Stan Lee who was a newspaper photographer. So why change???","

"kjproulx","4 June 2023","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse surprised the hell out of me back in 2018. Not only was I shocked at how entertaining it was, but also how well-crafted the story was. So, of course, I was eagerly awaiting the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Well, it's now playing in theatres and I'm honestly still trying to process it all. I'm not sure if words will be able to truly explain how much I loved this movie, but let's give it a go.After the events of the previous instalment left the multiverse wide open for exploring, we pick up right where we leave off, sort of. The film opens with a bit of Gwen's backstory and then dives into the family dynamic of Miles Morales' story once again, which will always be a highlight of these movies for me. Visited by Gwen, Miles decides to enter the multiverse again, but this time the stakes are far higher and certain revelations send this story in a whole new direction. I couldn't believe my eyes and what was visually being told, especially in certain moments. As a Spider-Man fan, I was grinning like a kid from ear to ear. It also gets much darker by the end which really surprised me for a film aimed at a younger audience.Even more than the first film, the animation here tells the story just as much as the dialogue. Each world had its own unique visual style and it seamlessly blended together after my eyes adjusted. At first I found all the animation styles jarring, but then I ended up thinking it was masterfully done. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen and it's seriously a work of art to look at and experience. I'm absolutely blown away by the look of this film.On top of the incredible animation, this story is just far deeper and richer than the first and is more mature as well. This is a film made for adults, with a child-like look to it. The scenes that both pay homage to the past while moving this story forward were inspired and I can't wait to see where they help the story further even more. This was a true theatrical experience I won't forget for a while. Yes, the animation is amazing and the story is incredibly well thought out, but if it wasn't for the screenplay this film wouldn't have also had the emotional impact.Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and Dave Callaham are a team that know exactly what they're doing here. I have full faith that the third film that closes out this trilogy will be just as good, simply because this film is very close to perfection for the story it was telling and I loved the first film too. Other than needing to adjust to the style a bit more than the first, I had zero complaints here and I haven't been able to say that about a movie in a while. If you can go along with the crazy visual style, I seriously can't recommend it enough. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is now playing in theatres and I think I have a new favourite Spider-Man movie, as a well as it currently being my favourite movie so far in 2023. It's truly spectacular in every conceivable way, especially for the type of film it is.","

The visuals and art are beautiful just like the first movie but this one has so many more plot twists and intense scenes mixed with comedy and it's just the perfect movie. I love how smart he is and his point in the movie, his wants and who he's trying to save it's perfect, I want a year to go by right now so I can watch the second part of the movie.

"art96321","2 June 2023","Wow, what an incredible film. Coming in with high expectations after how great the first film was. The different animations styles of the different types of spider mans as they interact with one another. At times it can seem trippy but it keeps you engage to always keep looking at the spider-man.While the first act is your normal coming of age tale of having to balance being Spider-man and a teenager. Things start becoming fast paced and intense with the story when it gets to the 2nd act of the film.The intensity of the film kept me engage with the action and comedy. Also the storyline is just perfectly written for a multi-verse film for spider-man.With all the references to other media of spider-man, this is the ultimate film for spider-man lovers in all type of media. This film is more than a superhero film but a legitimate movie of the year contender. Top 5 superhero movies for sure.So fun and engaging that you will want more as the film ends.","

Those were the only aspects I enjoyed and even so, the movie is so overstretched and boring that I fell asleep halfway through for a few minutes.By the way, if I want to read a comic I don't have to go to the movies. Especially the filter to make the entire picture look like comic book paper was unnecessary.I don't know what else to say. I guess I'm in the minority of viewers who didn't like it. But I'll definitely won't be watching another one. I guess if I knew what's going on I would have liked it?","

The details in the animation is mindblowing, like Miles' new suit that feels vibrant with the colors and texture.This is brave storytelling, this is art, this is the pure meaning with film and this is a breathtaking absolute masterpiece.The runtime is deserved and enjoyable thru out, it dares to set it own terms with giving us the plot and hang with the characters. There are brilliant tie-ins to the established multiverse, the character gallery is even better than Into the Spider-Verse and you can really feel the high stakes. Truly unpredictable and I wasn't prepared at all for the ending.Go watch it on IMAX-screen!","

"heyrandom","1 June 2023","I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it's predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it's predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024. I think Across the spiderverse has a real shot at the Oscar for best animated pictures, which Into the Spiderverse won in 2019.","

"dmoorejr","4 June 2023","At long last we have our sequel to Into The Spiderverse. One thing I'll point out is the astonishing animation/visual effects. Truly a work of art. The way each Spiderperson had their own unique style continues to be a highlight of this franchise. It was really cool to see all the different variations of Spider-Man all in one movie. With that being said the script was a little misguided, and really failed to tell a solid story in one movie. The focus of this movie is fractured, and we as an audience are along for the ride. Definitely feels like an extended 2nd act. I've aways said a movie should be more than sequel bait, and I feel the writers stretched this story to get one more movie out of it. While it'll be an epic binge in the future, I don't see myself rewatching this one until the Spiderverse trilogy is complete.","

"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","2 June 2023","It was fun to watch in the cinema. But this is for sure. Not as good as the first movie. In some scenes I was so bored, I even fell asleep. I don't think the effects are as good as the first movie. But still not bad of course. I had fun. Spidermen were great. It was so good to see different spidermen. The action wasn't bad either. The ""meme scene"" was so funny. But there was something that wasn't there. Also, the fact that they ended the movie halfway like a series lowered my respect for the movie. It was like a filler movie then. It could be better. Unfortunately, I don't know how the original voiceovers are not yet, since I watched it with dubbing. But I'm sure it's very good. Once again, I'll probably watch it in English. Anyway, I think it was a good animated movie, but not as good as the first movie.","

I really loved how gwen and miles' stories were expanded upon, and how many new characters were introduced - especially the scientist that got hit with a bagel in the previous movie. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to view the screening of the movie, and that was the highlight of my day, keeping me on the seat waiting for the next big event. The only part I disliked was probably the ginormous cliff hanger at the end - since now I have to wait till next march to view the final movie.I CANNOT wait until the third one is released, and the day it gets released - will be going to the theater to watch it.","

And it's a rush, an absolute blast for anyone looking for a summer escape.I love that the writers spend so much time on Miles and Gwen, their relationship, their struggles with expectation, and to see them go for a swing through NYC is just ... I love that vibe, man. In such a headlong flight of a story, it's refreshing to see Miles' social and family lives fleshed out.But it is a full-tilt movie, and once it starts dealing with the actual Spiderverse, it's chaotic, breathless and a welcome sensory barrage of color and eye-popping animation. It is a theme park ride, and one I'd absolutely do again.This continues to be the most unique, character-authentic series of Spider-Man movies and I am unquestionably a fan.","

Once again the revolutionizing art style steals the spotlight, with each character getting its own unique color palette and motion art, with visual angles to die for and creating some of the most jaw-dropping action scenes. Once again incredible voice-acting and writing, focusing on the core family bonds and how each spiderman's destiny and story correlate. The Villain ""Spot"" also is given his own unique journey.

"kylebelcher","8 June 2023","Either this movie is getting it's score bumped up by bot accounts, or I watched a ""mid"" version from another dimension.I'm honestly baffled by all reviews that I've seen for this movie. It's far from a masterpiece, but the critics who are speaking out against the film are seemingly doing so for clicks. Filling their ""review"" with zingers and half backed complaints about the movies undoubtedly fantastic art direction and animation.This movie falls flat when it comes to pacing and plot. The first half of the movie had me engaged, despite drawn out character moments (which are arguably needed, I'd just argue they could flow better and cut down on runtime) and the fact that we don't see Miles get pulled into the main plotline until a round half way through the film had me loosing some interest admittedly. This was something reviewers took into account for other films, like the first of The Hobbit trilogy, so why does this film get a pass?I was definitely ready to check out when we got to the scene on the bridge in Mumbai and Gwen was the only one to get an alert about a breach in the ""cannon"". How we can we blame Miles or Gwen for doing a sloppy job when the writing is sloppier? Why didn't anyone else present on the bridge get an alert? Why didn't Pavitr know about this cannon event like everyone else? When it's heavily insinuated that all of the Spider-Men/woman working for Miguel know about all of this stuff and are actively working to avoid a multiversal doomsday event.","

"benjaminskylerhill","1 June 2023","Today, I saw some of the most inventive, bold, and charming sequences I have ever witnessed on a big screen.Across the Spider-Verse sets up a huge amount of characters and plot devices, and it almost always does so with an astounding amount of grace, power, and wit.The internal conflicts given to Miles and Gwen are compelling, relatable, and emotionally wrenching. The first ten minutes of this movie alone made me feel more than most entire films I've seen all year.This takes the zany, colorful, creative action of the previous film and ups everything; the spectacle is thrilling and fast when it needs to be, but these filmmakers weren't afraid to pull back for small intimate character moments either.Admittedly, the movie does suffer from its need to set everything up for a big finale, as the story's two villains don't get nearly enough time or development to make the threat seem as big as it is. And the cliffhanger ending is, by its nature, unable to provide satisfying payoff for the things it sets up.So here I am, feeling like I just watched the first half of a masterful film, and though I'm not satisfied yet, I anxiously await part two. Because I was all in.","

The teenager tries hard to get his parents to ground him while triggering the nemesis with his humor. He misses Gwen who has joined the Spider Society and like any teenager, he wants Gwen and wants to be part of the society. How much of a serious threat The Spot gets to be and what does it cost to Miles' to save the spider-verse forms rest of the story.First, the visuals stand out again and the archival footages too got more cheers. They indeed set up the story well for Beyond the Spider-Verse. However, the plot felt overstuffed and since the final act was meant for setting up the story for the sequel, it simply drags on predictably. The stereotypical Mumbattan episode aside, the action and humor kept things engaging. Since the first movie went bonkers in it's final act, the sequel fell way short compared to that.","

"CinemaClown","16 June 2023","Bigger, better & breathtaking in ways most sequels never manage to, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an ambitious & audacious follow-up that takes what was refreshing & original about its predecessor and builds upon it in ways that catapults its world to better heights and delivers the expected greatness without sacrificing any of the emotional beats that ground its story & characters.Directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers & Justin K. Thompson in their feature directorial debuts, the film utilises different animations for the different dimensions our characters traverse through while keeping the narrative arresting & accessible from start to finish. And all the time it takes to setup its premise during the first half is the reason why it's able to provide an onslaught of awesomeness in the next half.Everything is an upgrade here, be it the story, characters, animation, visuals, music, wit, gags & underlying themes. And the energy, vibrance, passion, heart & sincerity poured into every frame is evident throughout. Characters, both new & reprising, are treated with care, handled with flair and embedded with personalities. And the twists & revelations surface in ways that only amplify its edge-of-the-seat thrills & our investment in it.The only nitpick for me would be its lack of a proper resolution as it ends on a cliffhanger and is one-half of a full story instead of featuring a self-contained narrative. Nevertheless, it's a minor complaint when taking into account the so many things that it gets right, for there are moments in this picture that had made me wondering if I'm watching the new greatest comic-book film of all time coz it's the perfect story of what it means to be a hero.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a bonafide masterpiece that outshines the first film in almost every aspect and is one of the greatest examples of its genre(s). A marvel of first-rate storytelling and a feat of groundbreaking animation that strikes a perfect balance between its visual & thematic elements, this latest offering in the Spider-Verse series is accomplished on all fronts and will leave its viewers absolutely dazzled yet hungry for more.","

"shrikrishnasriram","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse not only builds upon the brilliance of its predecessor but takes the scope of it to a whole new level. The film plunges audiences into an exhilarating journey across dimensions, where familiar characters and new faces collide in a visually stunning and emotionally resonant narrative.One of the standout aspects of this film is its ability to strike a delicate balance between paying homage to the original while expanding its universe in unexpected ways. The first movie introduced us to the groundbreaking animation style, capturing our hearts with its heartfelt storytelling and dynamic characters. Across the Spider-Verse, however, elevates the stakes and explores uncharted territories, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in this genre of movies as a whole.The animation remains a work of art, with each frame bursting with energy, inventiveness, and meticulous attention to detail. From the kaleidoscopic visuals that bring the various universes to life, to the fluid and dynamic action sequences that leave us breathless, every moment is a testament to the creativity and talent of the filmmakers.Moreover, Across the Spider-Verse delves deeper into the characters we fell in love with in the first film, allowing them to evolve and face new challenges. The emotional depth and growth of the characters resonate with audiences on a profound level, making us cheer for their triumphs and empathize with their struggles. The film strikes a perfect balance between heartwarming moments, thrilling action, and thought-provoking themes, making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. However, audiences should go into this knowing that it's definitely a 'Part 1' of a larger narrative in every sense.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse cements its place not only as a worthy successor to its predecessor but as a groundbreaking and unforgettable film in its own right. It expands the Spider-Verse in ways we couldn't have imagined, immersing us in a world of boundless imagination and emotional resonance. With its breathtaking animation, complex characters, and masterful storytelling, it stands as a testament to the power and potential of animated films, leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment in this extraordinary franchise.Choosing between the two is like choosing between your kids - the first is a tighter story but this movie is far more expansive and blows the scope of the movie into the stratosphere taking risks along the way. They're equally perfect in different ways.","

Scenes flash every 2 seconds and it was exhausting to follow. Animation is excellent, but this movie lacked the hook that made the first one so good. Maybe this is where movies are now headed, but I hope not. For a show aimed toward a younger audience, the film was way too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes and seemed to hold the audience hostage. Very hard to keep track of all the characters and plot shifts. Was hoping for something better but it seemed like a comic book on speed.","

"turleymjennifer","20 June 2023","I had such high hopes for this sequel, but the extreme artistic liberties with the constantly shifting backgrounds made it difficult to follow the dialog, the emotional scenes lost their impact for me when the characters were changing colour with every camera angle shift.I enjoyed the continued character development and additions of all the new spidermen, but I just could not get past the non stop swirling, flashing and dripping colours.The extreme use of the glitching and flashing graphics had me closing my eyes for periods of time just to get a break, as well it made the fight scenes and swinging scenes very difficult to follow.I understand the first movie had taken liberties with artistic aspects as well but I feel the second film was just over done with them.I still love the story line and where the film is going I just hope for my heads sake they tone it down a little in the next film.","

"SnoopyStyle","22 August 2023","Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy are back as they continue their adventures across the multiverse. There are more Spider-people in a whole multiverse organization of Spider-people. Miles is battling a not-so-super villain The Spot.This is a sequel to the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). It's a great follow-up to a great movie. Both have the great animated energy and fun comedy. It's a great continuation and expansion of this multiverse. The teens are a little older and their romance is getting deeper. There are interesting villains. If you love the first one, you'll love second one.","

"bhat-utsav","31 May 2023","A breath of fresh air amidst the horror show that the MCU has devolved into. I'm not sure if it's the constant disappointment from the latest Marvel movie, but this movie was beyond incredible.Another solid storyline, fantastic VA and art work, great soundtrack, and cameos that made me very happy. The addition of Oscar Isaac and Daniel Kaluuya helps elevate the movie further, they've done such a good job. Seeing Miles' relationship with Gwen and Peter be developed further was also great, as they try to balance doing what's good for the multiverse and what's good for Miles.I can't wait to see the next instalment, this is shaping up to be one of the better trilogies in cinema.","

"whatyalookinat","10 August 2023","From the opening scene I was sure the film's gonna be a masterpiece. An esthetically flawless picture with special animation style for each dimension. Especially Gwen's world, it was a definition of 'emotional', I still have goosebumps every time enjoying the scene. Also, the visuals were complemented by the soundtrack which made me wanna smile every time a song starts.Should I even mention all the references to not just the MCU, but other different things? I'm not sure if one can tell me the exact number of spiders that appeared. That's what Marvel does the best and it's the perfect film for such references.Overall, it was an unbelievable superhero picture with some interpersonal problems explored. I highly enjoyed the pacing of ATSV which wasn't boring at all. Looking forward to watching Beyond The Spiderverse. Not sure if it's gonna be EVEN better but my expectations are still high.","

"maxwellbourke","31 May 2023","Okay most movies don't have that great of a sequel but spider man across the spider verse isn't one of those. For. Started this movie had a great dose of action and humour and romance. One of the reasons why this movie works is that it has a whole universe to explore. And the characters are easy to love. And in this movie they explore Miles and Gwen relationship with each other. And Peter has MJ and a child. And all the characters they can have. There's so much references to The whole spider verse. And this movie lives up to the first one and it might be one of the best animated movie of all times.","

"mahmus","4 June 2023","Bigger and more ambitious than the first one in almost every way. Bigger stakes, more and fanservice and even more Spider-men, but never at the expense of the very personal and emotional story. The character development is incredible, with Gwen's story being the easy standout for me. The movie's fairly long and it doesn't waste a single minute. It could've been five hours long and I wouldn't have complained. It will obviously leave you wanting even more.The animation is mind-blowing. As gorgeous as you'd expect from a sequel to Into The Spider-verse.I don't know how they did it, but they did it. Again. What an incredible movie.","

"mkanatlar","3 June 2023","I rarely ever leave reviews on movies but I just had to say a couple of things about Across the Spider-Verse. The first movie was already so amazing that it inspired creativity in the animation industry but this installment just finessed its style. The different universes and styles, different animations; there were genuine moments where I felt chills just looking at the screen.I'm a story guy, I can appriciate good cinematography and visuals but the main thing that gets me going while watching movies is the story and let me tell you something: THIS IS SOME DAMN GOOD WRITING. The dialogue feels so alive and realistic, the small mimics and details make you feel like every scene was spent countless hours on to perfect. It all comes together beautifully. It works amazing as both a sequel and the set up of the third film, yet it is also a great standalone film as my friend who hasn't seen the first one also found it amazing.We can't forget the acting, as good as the animations and the hand drawings are amazing, the voice acting is as spectacular if not better than the first film. There has never been a moment which a character seemed dull or insensible. Props to all the voice actors, especially Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfield. I don't know the recording process of the voice lines but Miles and Gwen didn't have one moment where it didn't feel like I was watching a chemical reaction.The only thing that made me sad is that as the time frame got closer to the end, I expected the movie to end the way it did. I'm not mad because it ended the way it did but because I thought I'd have to wait 3 or 4 years for the sequel. Thank god it is announced to release next year so that's that.Whether you're an elder, adult, teen, or a child; this Spider-Verse story has something for you. Not only you'll enjoy the experience of watching a comic book; you'll also go through a fun, but heartfelt story. I think this is a movie everyone should see.","

"utvolssam","24 June 2023","This is most definitely the movie of the year! The animation, the backgrounds for characters, the fight scenes. All just amazing. It made me really think about how much people in my life mean to me and how much I mean to them. I have absolutely no idea how they were able to top the last one but they did. I'm a bit worried that they won't be able to top the next one though, all doubts set aside, I still think that they have the abilities to pull it off. That's why I am truly excited for the next one. By the way it is coming out at the end of march next year if anyone wanted to know. Hey at least it's not another 5 years like the last one.","

"nqmedia","31 July 2023","This is my favorite animated film of the year and was better than I was expecting (as I'm over the whole multiverse storyline in films). It took a horrible comic villain and made it into a formidable foe; it took one of my favorite Spider-Mans (Spider-Man 2099) and made him into a formidable and flawed hero/villain, and it crafted and amazing story for both leads, while also ending the story in Part 1 while setting up another spin-off story for Part 2. I also loved the mix of animation styles as it made sense to the story (and wasn't just a gimmick) and the music score was perfect! One of the best films of '23 in my opinion.","

"asayed-63121","3 June 2023","This is how a movie featuring multiverse should be.The first thing that one notices in the movie is how they have amped up their animation game. If you think the the animation in the previous installment was great, wait till you set your eyes on this one. With gorgeous colour palettes, each frame can be a wallpaper on your personal dekstop.No Spoilers here, but if you are a spidey-buff you will have fun picking up on the easter eggs. It is plain to see that the makers have a ton of love for the source material. From references to cameos, you will find everything over here.The soundtrack was also amazing. The collection of songs perfectly captured the tone of the film.The plot of the movie is also something that needs to be appreciated. It makes you root for the character and the third half of the film has a twist that you wouldn't see coming. There was a collectible gasp from the audience in the cinema while I watching, as no one expected. Even though there are jokes, it doesn't distract us from the core narrative, which has been the problem with MCU moviesEven though the movie is 2 hours 20 minutes long, the movie passes away like a breeze, you won't find yourself bored or checking your phone. Which is perfect for a commercial superhero flick.","

"TreeFiddy53","14 August 2023","I had a chance to watch this in IMAX/Dolby, chose not to. I regret that decision now. If you're like me and haven't watched it yet, please go to the theater and don't get a digital rent/wait for streaming.Getting back, this has easily shot up to the top of my list of movies I enjoyed this year, by far the favorite. I'm probably late with this so I'll keep it short.Visuals - STUNNING! I haven't seen these many colors in an English film before.Animation and Editing - EPIC! I have no idea how much effort went into making the Paramount Pictures/Sony logo and editing it to get the glitch effect, let alone the entire film. *slow claps*
Music and Sound Design - AMAZING! The OST and the way it's been used throughout the film - I'd watch it again for this and the visuals alone.Writing - AWESOME! It's not easy write for a film, I can't begin to think how tough it would have been to write something to bring everybody in and make a Spider-society without making it feel choppy. And I am not even going to attempt to comment on the writing for the storyline.A cinematic experience like nothing else - don't miss this in big screens. You can always re-watch on digital/streaming.","

"hucken","8 August 2023","I struggled giving it 10/10, but i can't think of a negative thing here.First of all the music is perfect. Especially the intro / Gwen Stacy part was perfect here. Her emotions amplified by the drums. Her vs. Peter and when she puts on the costume in her room going into the next fight and the whole fight theme. Everything was elevated by the music perfectly and hyped me up for the complete first part of the movie.And the art style ... it is just beautiful. It is brave to have such unique art style for a whole movie and it pays of. Every scene is a piece of art. If you have the video, you can pause like every frame and make a wallpaper out of it.The story was good too. When you thought it was predictable, it wasn't (e.g. Hey there is this machine that brings you back to your universe - that will absoluteley be used later - but didn't see the plot twist here)
Also some deep plote lines everywhere. The movie was long and i was never bored. Worst was the TBC. (but a plus for the movie itself, because you wanted to continue to watch)I wanted to make a minus point on the fast combat/swing scenes, but even there - it was fast, sometimes hard to follow but it still had a really nice flow to it that made it enjoyable. They were able to make every move of the Spider-whatever powerful and impactful.Half of the movie was a Spider Gwen movie and i wasn't even mad about it. The character is so good, that i hope they will make a Spider Gwen spin-off.","

"powellian6","4 June 2023","Wow I cannot believe how good this movie was. I expected it to be extremely good based of trailers and the enjoyment I had with Into The SpiderVerse (2018) but this takes everything to the next level.Sony Pictures Animation has made the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing animated film ever made. It's incredibly impressive to see the layers and layers of animation. The color is beautiful vibrant and bright constantly changing color schemes that fit the moods and characters of those that are in frame. It's an excellent way to add an layer of depth within this world that in real time would be extremely hard to capture. I honestly have no idea how you make a movie like this.The music is phenomenal as I expected. Channeling from lo fi chill music to high octane beats and chilling numbers across the board this has some of the best music in any animated film.The big catch for most people is that this is an incomplete film. While it does leave us on the edge of our seats asking for me the film itself is a complete story with certain characters. Sure the whole thing isn't quite settled but I don't expect the last one to miss at all especially since it will be out next year and it's already made.This is the best Spider-Man movie ever made and might even run into the next greatest spider man movie ever made establishing itself as possibly the greatest superhero trilogy of all time. Without a doubt see this movie.","

"parasvanzari","3 June 2023","Honest and totally honest. If people are giving 8-9 stars for just graphics and designing & VFX, back up people, there's alot more there should be for a 9 star.It starts good, it gives you hopes, the comedy is good, but then, it gets all sentimental and emotional. I know it's needed, but it just gets so much that it kind of gets sleepy.They carry the story too slow because of this emotional backstories, not actually focusing on the main writing, I don't really think the back stories were really required so much and even more so, not so much in DETAIL.After all things said and done, the movie heads to main plotline, how to get to stop the villain, a squad is formed for that, the main character is stuck and needs to find a way out, it all gets interesting, and then, A CLIFFHANGER. End.Wasted too much time in the unnecessary and making a part 3 out of that seems like a 'loosen your pocket for more in the next one'.People giving 8-9 stars, even 10, seriously! Grow up kiddos. This movie wasn't MARVEL at all. It was Disneyland for kids.","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","22 June 2023","Even if I'd had a nice quiet crowd the first time I saw this (I really didn't), this still felt like the kind of movie that demanded a second viewing. Distractions aside, there's just a lot to take in the first time around. The basics are well explained, but the extra/additional details come fast and things that aren't specifically part of the core story can pass by so speedily I couldn't catch as much as I wanted to. A second viewing honestly felt like a first viewing for more than half this movie. I caught a couple more jokes, appreciated the unexpected turns in the narrative (that ending included), and just enjoyed the whole thing a great deal more.I still prefer the first Spider-Verse movie by a hair, because it has a little more emotional weight for me, and I think it's paced a touch better. But Across the Spider-Verse is still emotional and well-paced; I think it flies by so quickly that that ending feels shocking on a first viewing, because the film kind of feels like two acts (with an extended prologue and epilogue) rather than three. The structure's interesting and a little odd, but again, it worked better after seeing it once, and being able to piece it all together while seeing it play out again.And it probably goes without saying, but the animation here is just out of this world. That's the one area that is better than the first, and the first already looked amazing. The music's also just as good, possibly even better. I hope Beyond the Spider-Verse will conclude this trilogy amazingly, and it's probably no exaggeration to say it might be my most anticipated movie of 2024, at least for now (and I'm sure others feel the same way).","

"hassannaima-55714","2 July 2023","This here movie isn't one of those movies when animation is the only good part. This here movie has amazing story, and connects really well to the first movie overall. It seems like all this was planned ahead, and it probably was.I really liked the movie and its characters. We now get a new villain who opposes Miles, with his motives being very clear. He also is a bit comedic in the first half, though he gets taken more seriously later on. It wouldn't be exciting to have an antagonist with no real threat.Gwen Stacy plays a more important role in this movie, which we clearly needed. I'm glad the movie showed a bit more of what she was going with post-Into the Spiderverse. Instead of having a 30 second clip summarising her story, we have a 30 minute beauty telling her storyWe're also introduced to other such as new character, Miguel (Spider-man 2099), Hobbie (Spider Punk), Mumbai's spider-man, and so on. I cannot dive deep into these characters because it would spoil a lot of the movie. Though, I enjoyed that all the different spider-man had their own animation style. This here is something we're going to see time and time again in the next movie.The animation doesn't seem like a can of spray paint painted across, it isn't too fast and you can see what is going on. All you do is sit there and admire the movie and its fantastic animation, it looks and feel like music going through not your ears, but your eyes. Now I get why this here movie was being delayed. The soundtrack is nearly as good, and helps really drive the intensity of much of the scenes. Just take a look, and listen to the soundtrack. I promise to you won't regret it.The only down part is the ending, it makes this movie feel like a too long intro to the next. Also because it hypes you up for the next movie, by having the scene near the ending be so good and exciting.I can't really complain because everything else was done so good.Overall: The Animation, The characters, the story, the Soundtrack, the movie is all executed beautifully. 10/10.","

"eoinageary","12 July 2023","I had tried to stay away from trailers to avoid as much as I can and wow, I am blown away.The story is good, it's a follow up to the previous where Miles is still struggling to balance the spider life and being a kid, he is missing his multiverse friends and especially Gwen. The movie really gets going when a new villain called spot who can travel through holes to anywhere is demolished by miles and insulted. He plans to grow his powers, creating the ability to multiverse travel. The story goes on and it's hard to say as it continues after spoilers but things MUST happen but Miles can't accept it.The animation was AMAZING,seeing miles and Gwen swing through NY was perfect, it goes along with a pitch perfect score, there was once or twice the voices were quite low behind the music but that could have been the cinema. I also love that there are 2 major different sides when it comes to Miles and Spider-Man 2099, and I can 100% see both sides !!!Obviously it's around Miles but this movie is equally Gwens movie, she has gone through and is going through a lot. The supporting characters were all great and this movie is genuinely funny.This is not a spoiler but the movie ends on a cliffhanger and the third movie is scheduled for next year. This doesn't take away from the movie, it leaves me wanting more in a good way, 9/10.","

"ethiotst-53110","5 June 2023","Greatest animated film is not a title I would give out lightly. It is up against some amazing films, like Wall-E, Toy Story, How to train your dragon 2, Up (pretty much most pixar movies). But Across the Spiderverse easily beats those films, something I never thought I would say.Animation/art style.The strongest part of this film is the animation. Every shot is this beautiful frame with so much going on. The comic book style animation just like the first film is excellently utilised. It is simply one of the most cinematic movies, and such a beautiful film, it really proves that animated films can be just as good as live action and not ""just for kids"".Story.Can't say too much without spoiling the movie but the story is super intriguing and explores some very interesting themes that the first film introduced but didn't really tackle all that much. It creates quite an emotional ride at times and the 'problem' that drives the plot forward is a really good one and simple yet unique idea even if it is introduced well into the movie.Characters.The characters are really developed past the funny bit that introduces the characters in the first film. Gwen's backstory is explored giving us more emotional investment in the film. Miles is funny and cool as ever, keeping his slight awkwardness.One of the antagonist (if you can really call him one) has a very justified motive that most people would agree with, all but Miles, this is why you can't really call him a bad guy per se.The true antagonist gas a really cool design, costume and character wise, his backstop is goofy and his introduction is too but he evolves throughout the film into this really cool villain.Side characters are interesting especially one of them that is all about going against the establishment.Background characters were honestly one of this movies strengths, there were so many characters that showed up even for a second or two that made me gasp and gave me a huge grin, don't want spoil any as part of the enjoyment from this film are the different spidermen you meet.","

"OldMovieRob","7 January 2024","Couldn't get into this one. It drags and meanders and maybe I'm just getting old but visually everything seems choppy, flashing and hard to follow. The story seems a over the place as well with far too many characters with stories going on, which seems to be how Marvel is going with the last few of their films I've seen. The sassy, i-know-more-than-you attitude of the female characters also gets a little tedious after awhile. I guess thr main thing is, I don't follow also why they had to retell Spiderman and not just roll out a new character, since this feels like a completely different character in a completely different universe. Well, whatever.","

"quiqueperezsoler","31 May 2023","The writers behind the Spiderverse movies are some of the best of our time. Not only do they know how to craft a unique, high-staked, deeply personal and riveting story, but their respect for the legacy of Spider-Man is beyond perfect.And that's all it takes, folks. For everyone and anyone whose working on preestablished franchises (Star Wars, Marvel, DC...), who want to follow up the adventures or stories in a robustly-built universe, all you need is to ""read up"". To understand what makes it work and use those strengths to your advantage.This movie is one of the best Spider-man stories I have ever seen. It's unlike any other told in the comics and movies, it's fresh, provocative (in the good way) and all out bonkers. Needless to say, the animation is top notch. I mean, Sony Animation Studios has developed into a powerhouse of stylised animation. It already showed in the trailers, but if you liked the different styles used in the animation of each spiderperson from other universe, you are going to have a fieldtrip with this one.Almost everything works in this movie, the comedy, the set pieces, the world-building, the emotional and dramatic moments. It's simply top tier cinema, not animated cinema alone, but overall cinema. The romantic tension, the new character's personalities and relationships, it's all around perfect, I would not change a thing.There's so many pros that I don't think I can put into words the amount of things this movie does right. The long action scenes, animation style, sound design and soundtrack, the script, the characterisation of old and new spider people. I have only praises for this movie. But the biggest one is what I said previously, the respect and understanding of the mythos and lore of Spider-man is what saves this movie for the bigger fans. Because Spider-man is not a hard story to adapt, but there's a lot of good stuff in it and the way the writters play with preestablished media and introducing new media to the people while not being too much to handle for the audience is brilliant.There're references for everyone, for those who saw only the movies, or the shows, or the games, or the tv shows, or the comics. I don't want to jump into spoilers, I just want to point out all the good qualities this movie has, that carries from the previous and some which are improved and amped to the max.Just the ambition of the story they are trying to tell here already surpases any and all expectations. I whole-heartedly believe they are breaking grounds here and they are changing the way the Spider-man universe works and I applaud their fantastic work. I hope the next one fulfills the catharsis that left me wanting more after the credits roled in this one.If anything, and I mean very mildly ruined the experience for me, that is, I lowered from a 10/10 to a 9/10, was two aspects that bugged me more than I expected. One of them is, you can tell this movie was divided in two while you watch it: the pacing is a bit slow in some scenes, action scenes that drag just a bit too much some times or emotional scenes that go on when all that was meant to be said was done. And the other aspect is, and this may be a bit spoilery, so if you don't wanna read more NOW IS THE TIME NOT TO READ MORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED:I think the prologue and recap of the previous movie at the beginning of this one wasn't too.. right. It threw me off a bit just because they went on for too long, like they tried to flesh out the background story of someone and, despite how this comes back full circle in the end, it just carries on and on it's a bit too long before we get to where everyone is. Also, and this is last spoilery thing, I feel there's a bit of a flaw of continuity when Gwen ""comes back to see Miles"", like between the ending of the previous movie, and this one. They didn't connect it too well I think (ahem, Miles seems different).","

"kxqpmnzt","2 June 2023","I was worried that the follow-up to what is my favorite movie would fall short, as is the case so often. But even still, I went in with high expectations and they were ABSOLUTELY met. Dare I say this is even better than the first? Animation was innovative and spectacular, script was whip smart and clever as hell, character development surpassed most live-action films, and there were twists and turns all along the way.What made the first so great was built upon in this movie, but they did it in a smart, thoughtful way. I'm remarkably excited for Beyond the Spider-Verse to be released to see how this story ends!","

Never have I felt this passionately about a superhero movie before. Every frame was breathtaking. The use of colour to convey each emotion was phenomenal. It was a rollercoaster of emotions with a soundtrack that did not stop amazing me. The humour, the wit, the subtle messaging, I could watch this one a million times. My personal favourite scenes where the one with Gwen and her dad and the one with Gwen and Miles pictured to Monalisa. But the whole movie was remarkable. It truly won my heart.","

"flavours_ignobleo","3 January 2024","I absolutely loved the previous movie Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, it became my favourite animation to date by far. The storyline, animation and soundtrack is amazing! 10/10...But I lost interest in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse within 30mins. The storyline felt boring, repetitive and scatty. The cramming in of as many teen and family cliches as possible (in order to make it relatable no doubt) felt very forced and unnatural. It made it more of a teen movie, rather than for all the family like the last one. There is also a sense that the Diversity Equity Inclusion 'committee' strongly informed the story and characters, which again came across as forced, which left me wondering was their top priority writing a great story, or was it to meet certain DEI quotas.Anyway this film does not compare to the previous and I have no idea why it's scored so highly, one film is an absolute masterpiece, the other is a giant action-packed cliche.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","1 June 2023","The MCU's struggling to find new focus on anything post Avengers: Endgame, and this film is probably THE ideal blueprint for how other filmmakers can tackle the all-encompassing wackiness of multiverses, especially with a character as beloved and established as Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse was originally a Part I, but then Part II became Beyond The Spider-Verse (which is due next year), and it's clear these films are becoming the Toy Story equivalent for animated superhero cinema. The characterisations are air-tight, the screenplay knows the difference between metaphysical craziness and intimate character arcs, and the animation goes above and beyond in terms of remixing itself with SOOOO many different styles and vibes.First and foremost, the primary story focuses on Miles and Gwen, and how the Spider-Verse is making their lives all the more crazy and larger than they ever dreamed of. And it's also about making peace with their vigilante careers, and accepting that they're part of something bigger than Spider-Man alone. And nothing's getting in the way of compromising who they are deep down: compassionate heroes who'd risk themselves for the greater good.A sequel that's bolder and bigger than its already great precursor, Into The Spider-Verse, that this film leaves you wanting more in the BEST way possible. And this cliffhanger: it's a doozy. It brings the film's arcs to a close yet leaves them open enough that they'll lend themselves to Beyond The Spider-Verse (hopefully) rather nicely.Across The Spider-Verse is even crazier than Into The Spider-Verse, and it manages to complement the film rather than 'overtake' it in terms of relevance. Here's hoping Beyond The Spider-Verse delivers what it promises us.I give Across the Spider-Verse 10/10 IMDb points. 5/5 stars.P. S. This film's craziness... needs to be SEEN to be believed! Hell, this might be THE proverbial metaphysical film of 2023.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a hyperactive techno-dream of super-heroic proportions, and it's the (presumably) penultimate chapter of The Spider-Verse Saga. And what a Saga it is so far!Spider-Man's easily one of cinema's most iconic superheroes and he's had to endure some REAL triumphs and headaches along the way (for every Spider-Man 2, there's an Amazing Spider-Man 2). And Across The Spider-Verse is another defining chapter in Spider-Man's storied legacy on the big screen.This one's gonna have some strong praise for it, and there's gonna be detractors saying it's not as well-rounded as the first (both situations are understandable), but what the film does right it does it in proud strides. It's like an arthouse Spider-Man film that knows fan-service has its own depths of character and history, and the lines between animation and live-action are virtually non-existent in the Spider-Verse.For such a tried-and-true character like Spider-Man, it's pretty damn surprising and refreshing the Spider-Verse films are as solid as they are. Sure some of the world building may have SOME plot-holes regarding the machinations of multiverse logic, but its playbook is easily the most creative one in cinema today. And by far the nuttiest too.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is running laps around its competition right now, and it's one of those rare examples where a sequel deserves every ounce of praise it gets. Toy Story had that same magic (up to Toy Story 3); now Spider-Man's Spider-Verse is taking its crown.Rock-solid story, chaotic visuals and deep characters that are bigger than one universe alone. 10/10 IMDb points. 5/5 stars.","

"southdavid","10 June 2023","I really loved ""into the Spiderverse"" and so this sequel is one that I've been looking forward to for a while. I'm so happy that it doesn't disappoint and even manages to improve on almost every aspect from the first.Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is invited to join ""The Spider Society"" after helping Spiderman 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and Jessica Drew (Issa Rae) defeat a Renaissance variant Vulture (Jorma Tacccone) in her world. The Spider Society jump between universes fixing anomalies. Months later, she comes back to Miles Morales' (Shameik Moore) world, tracking The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) a villain able to utilise holes in space to commit crimes. Though specifically told not to, she makes contact with Miles and drags him to another universe with disastrous consequences.It's a great story. Clever and well thought through and allowing for great deal of both humour and pathos. There are hundreds of Spiderman variants in the film, most are played for laughs and can have little more than a few seconds screentime, but some are key, such as Hobie - The Spider-Punk variant from England voiced by Daniel Kaluuya or Spiderman India voice by Karan Soni. The main variants from the last film don't really re-appear, until the very end of the movie - with the exception of Peter B Parker - voiced again by Jake Johnson.But visually the film is a step up too, something that I wouldn't have thought possible. The blending of various different animation styles is amazingly well done. How the interactions between these characters work is staggering. It's a genuine joy to just to look at something that this much effort has gone into and is this dynamic.I can't imagine for a second that this won't be very close to my best film of the year, come December. It's certainly the one to beat.","

They are such a spectacle to behold, pushing the boundaries of animation with every frame, but never forgetting to provide an engaging story with so much depth and heart to every character.Across the spiderverse is bigger and bolder than the previous entry. There is so much fan service and so much happening at once it can be hard to keep track of it on a first viewing. It wasn't until a second viewing that I began to appreciate and respect the care and love that went into every scene of this movie. It had an unpredictable story and ended in a way that will make you wish beyond the spiderverse was here right now. These movies are modern masterpieces and we are lucky to be able to witness them spectacularly unfold.","

It exceeded my expectations, honestly i had lower expectation due to not a big fan of any animation film, but this suprises me, looking forward for the sequel.Spiderverse shattered all my preconceived notions about animation films, leaving me awestruck and craving for more. From the very first scene to the final credits, this movie delivered a breathtaking visual experience that was simply unmatched. The attention to detail, vibrant colors, and innovative animation techniques made every frame a work of art.What truly set Spiderverse apart was its unique storyline and compelling characters. The film brilliantly introduced us to a multiverse of Spider-Men and Spider-Women, each with their own distinct personality and backstory. It was a joy to witness the diverse cast of characters coming together, forming an unlikely team of heroes who were relatable and deeply human.","

"lisafordeay","3 June 2023","Spiderman Across The Spidey Verse is the sequel to the 2018 film Spiderman Into The Spidey Verse(2018).The movie stars Shailek Moore,Hailee Steinfeld and Jason Schwartzmann. Gwen Stacey(Steinfeld) now Spider Woman teams up with Miles Morales in a different universe to take out the sneaky Spot(Schwartzmann) who seeks revenge on Miles. Will they save New York City from Spot? Or will they get help from other Spidermen from the different universes?Overall I thought it was a very good movie. Just like the original it has beautiful animation styled like a comic book,the story was engaging and the voice acting was top notch. I guess the only complaint is that the film is very long especially an animated film as they are usually on for 80 minutes or 104 minutes. If you've got kids they might be feeling uneasy or then again they might not feel the running time passing by.A-Also features Donald Glover.","

"adityabagri-67458","2 June 2023","""Across the Spider-Verse"" introduces an extraordinary ensemble of characters that truly make the film shine. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is undeniably the best CBM of 2023, its not even close(taste of all mid af cbms like gotg3,antman3 and shazam 2 is washed away) thanks to its exceptional characters, a compelling storyline, emotional depth, and a cliffhanger that leaves us hungry for more. Spider-Punk, with his rebellious spirit and unique punk-inspired appearance, brings a fresh and exciting energy to the story. Pavitr Prabhakar, the Spider-Man of India. His presence not only expands the Spider-Verse but also adds depth to the story as what canon is what is supposed to happen and what is not in the spiderverse. Ben Rileytake on the Spider-Man mythology. Spider-Gwen to impress with her dynamic and empowering portrayal. Her qrelatable vulnerabilities, and growth as a hero make her an incredibly likable and compelling character and her journey is quiet great in the movie. Of course, the heart of the story remains with Miles Morales, whose growth as a hero continues to impress. Miles' journey of self-discovery, responsibility, and finding his own voice within the Spider-Verse is masterfully portrayed. His relatability, vulnerability, and undeniable charm make him a character that audiences genuinely care about and root for. Peter B. Parker in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" not only shines as a hero but also as a great husband, mentor, and father figure. His portrayal as a loving and supportive husband to Mary Jane Watson, and as a caring mentor and father figure to Mayday Parker, is truly commendable. Together, these characters form a rich tapestry that sparks genuine emotional investment from viewers. Their individual arcs and interactions create a dynamic ensemble that balances moments of humor, heart, and intense action. The chemistry among the characters is palpable, enhancing the storytelling and making the Spider-Verse feel alive and vibrant.Furthermore, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" excels in delivering a gripping and well-crafted storyline. The narrative takes viewers on an exhilarating journey through multiple dimensions, filled with unexpected challenges and confrontations with an array of villains. The story seamlessly weaves together themes of self-discovery, responsibility, and the importance of family, creating a tapestry of depth and emotion. The film strikes a perfect balance between thrilling action sequences and poignant character-driven moments, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish.Let's not forget the jaw-dropping cliffhanger that leaves us eagerly anticipating the next installment. It leaves us with burning questions, heightened anticipation, and an insatiable desire to witness what comes next in this intricate web of storytelling.","

"JackRJosie","16 July 2023","I want to be a part of the crowd that says they're done with superhero movies. There's a little superiority complex there. Although I believe superhero flicks are destroying the film industry, they are so dang fun. Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse is unlike any superhero movie you will probably ever see. It's surely not your run of the mill. Perhaps films like this bring serious innovation to the big screen rather then destruction! I believe it so, as this film is unlike anything I've ever seen before.The animation is unreal, so creative and mind blowing that human being are even capable of creating this kind of 2D art! It's a seriously impressive film artistically speaking, and the brilliance doesn't end there.After watching the first spider verse film you would think they wrapped up a good thing, but they carry on this Miles Morales story in a really good way. This story is so fresh and exciting that it had 'e staring at the screen in disbelief (and sensory overload) with my jaw to the floor. So unbelievably fun and creative.See this film. Twice probably. Can't wait for #3.","

"alessandro_sp","17 August 2023","As with the first film but upping the ante a notch, this sequel reinstates the choices made before. Sony has made such a genious move. They developed a style on their own, which cannot be plagiarized without backfiring on whoever does it. Bold, successful move. Haven't seen something like this since What dreams may come (1998).And it's not a case of all looks and no substance either. The story backs the visuals, and it wasn't until 15 minutes from the end that I noticed the movie wouldn't wrap in this installment. The pace, story and cinematic choices really draw you into it, so much so that you don't notice time passing by.If I have only one criticism is that in fact pace is so fast that one might miss several references or jokes. Other than that, congratulations on Sony and Marvel for setting new and higher standards.","

"ethanbresnett","2 July 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is such a complete sequel and a more than worthy successor to Into the Spider-Verse.Visually it is such a stunningly rich film, full of vibrancy and creativity. The different worlds are individually crafted to feel unique which makes the film that much more absorbing. The various animation and artistic styles that are used really bring the characters and situations to life. The uses of colour are intriguing and tell a story all on their own. Visually this film is just a real treat.But that's not to say this film is style over substance, because the story is strong throughout. It has pace and drive that really propels things forward, and for such a far reaching story it is handled really well. It never feels like it is overreaching or too padded out, and the runtime breezes by.Another string to its bow is its balance of humour and drama. Lately a lot of superhero films try to be both funny and serious, and the humour ends up undercutting the drama and emotion of the story. Spider-Verse manages to do both exceedingly well. It is a funny film that also packs some powerful emotional and dramatic punches, balancing these two tones very well.To top it all off, the film has a terrific score that further heightens all of the visual and narrative themes to make for a very complete and well rounded film.Just a terrific experience all around!","

"jordyntsmith","7 June 2023","Miles Morales gets into the Spiderverse again. The stakes are higher, the emotions are stronger, and life is harder - things we all identify with.While this movie was highly anticipated, I feared it would be over hyped. Into the Spiderverse seemed perfect - a fantastic standalone movie that a sequel has the potential to ruin. BUT, Across the Spiderverse does it. It masterfully continues where the original picked up, connecting lose ends, and expanding the franchise seemlessly. Somehow, this film grounds the multiverse trope with its focus on human emotion, themes of loss, finding your purpose, and coming of age. Miles and Gwen are characters I really shouldn't identify with, but I do. Their stories and feelings are compelling, and what make this soon to be trilogy so special.Go watch it. Though it may be too intense for some littles, this movie (and the first one) are must-see.","

"diogomouraviegas","25 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning animated film that brings together multiple Spider-people from different dimensions. The film is a continuation of the first Spider-Verse movie, and it certainly delivers on the hype. From the opening scene, the film immerses its audience in a vibrant and colorful multiverse where anything is possible.The animation is one of the best things about the film. It's a mix of traditional hand-drawn animation and computer-generated graphics, creating an eye-catching visual style that perfectly captures the comic book feel of the Spider-Man universe. The attention to detail in the animation also extends to the character design and the backgrounds, making every scene a feast for the eyes.The voice cast is also top-notch. Shameik Moore returns as Miles Morales, and Jake Johnson reprises his role as Peter B. Parker. New additions include Issa Rae as Spider-Woman, Hailee Steinfeld as Spider-Gwen, and other talented actors who bring their unique flair to their respective Spider-characters.Aside from the animation and the story, the soundtrack is another highlight of the film. The score by Daniel Pemberton is a thrilling and exciting mix of orchestral and electronic music that perfectly complements the action-packed scenes. The film also features a variety of popular songs, from Post Malone's ""Sunflower"" to Lil Nas X's ""Montero,"" adding another layer to the film's already impressive audiovisual experience.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is simply one of the best animated films ever made. It's a thrilling and action-packed adventure that delivers on all fronts, from the animation to the story, the voice acting, and the music. It's a movie that will appeal to both long-time Spider fans and newcomers to the franchise. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and swing into the Spider-Verse.","

The dialogue is witty, and heartfelt, and shows a genuine understanding of what makes Spider-Man such a relatable character.This sequel is a complete accomplishment that serves as a monument to the power of narrative and the virtually endless potential of animation. It's a movie that will speak to viewers of all ages and have a lasting impact. When the ending card appeared, I couldn't believe it had already been over two hours.

The amount of callbacks and references throughout was a delight, and none of it felt forced. Everything flowed naturally with the story. Some are saying the film is a bit too long. I disagree. I would've sat there for another 2 hours just to see how this story is going to end, and what else they could've done with this art style. My booty would've been sore, but my mind would've been a happy camper! If you do decide to see this, which you 100% should (it may be the best film of the year, but still too early to tell), see it in the IMAX format. It's absolutely breathtaking and you can really see the attention to detail put into the absolutely jaw dropping artwork on display here. Overall, I highly recommend it. Bring the whole family. You'll be enchanted by the story, while the kids will be distracted by the artwork and awesome chase sequences.5 spideys out of 5.","

"ninjaninja-85128","22 July 2023","First off, I see a ton of reviews knocking this movie, giving it a low score mainly for the movie leaving in a cliffhanger... are you serious? Who knew it's a requirement to not leave a movie in a cliffhanger in order for it to be a good movie.I have seen Across the Spiderverse 4 times in theaters. Each time going into the theater I think the movie won't catch my eye like the last watch, and every time I'm wrong. The whole movie is complete eye candy. The animation is incredible, the colors, the art styles. Even from the opening credits... the amount of effort that went into the credits must've been ridiculous.The story has a really nice pace. While having suspenseful and emotional moments in there as well which really hit close to home. The plot was clever with The Spot. Turning from a joke to a serious threat. I loved the music that was used. A lot of the jokes hit. The characters introduced weren't overwhelming, and there were some returning characters which was a nice surprise.I mainly wanted to make this review to say if you rate this movie anything less than an 8 it's just a total insult to everyone who worked on this movie. The animation alone is way better than Into the Spiderverse. Absolutely stunning. There are also plenty of great movies out there that end on cliffhangers, Infinity War being one. This movie is among the greats, regardless of what you may think of the ending.","

It's a great setup for the next movie and if that one is nearly as good then this trilogy could be considered not just one of the best in animation but one of the best trilogies ever made period. You can take any frame of this movie and turn it into a poster. There isn't anything that I would change. It is by far the best spiderman movie and easily the best marvel movie.","

"maceman1220","5 June 2023","Haven't been able to stop thinking about this since I saw it earlier today, already planning my next viewing (this time in IMAX, was only able to see it normal tonight).I had a great time with the first film. It was fresh, exciting, full of heart, and just an excellent experience. But man, as of now, this just knocks it out of the water.To start, the animation. Oh the animation. The first film was breathtaking, introduced a new style of animation that was so unique and felt so connected to the story. Now, after watching this film, it feels like my first time seeing it. The animation and how it's infused into the storytelling is on a whole other level. The use of color and so many different art styles is truly mesmerizing. To me, this feels like the first animated film I've seen to truly use the medium to the fullest extent capable.Beyond the visuals, the story and characters are just so rich. The cast is exceptional, and the focus on the human drama adds so much weight to every big moment. Every action scene hits so much harder because you care about these people and you understand why they're fighting. There's so much emotional weight carried through every moment. I especially loved the focus on Gwen. You really see so much of the film through her eyes and her story is so deep and heartbreaking.Also, beyond the emotion, the film is HILARIOUS. So many incredible jokes, visual gags, hilarious cameos. Started coughing laughing in a few scenes. Also shout-out to Hobie being one of the baddest (in the best way possible) dudes I've ever seen onscreen.Yes, it's definitely part one. It ends on a massive cliffhanger. My feelings on this film may change if the next doesn't stick the landing, but from the quality on display here, I have nothing but faith. I didn't want it to end, I could've sat through the next film immediately after this without as much as a bathroom break. I would've stayed all night in that theater.This genuinely feels like nothing I've really seen before, one of the only films I can compare it to is Everything Everywhere All At Once for shear imagination on display. It's one of the best superhero films I've seen, one of the greatest animated films I've ever seen, one of the best movies I've seen these last few years, and it's gonna be a long 9 months till part 2.","

"timeblank","8 June 2023","I felt a bit lost watching this fast-paced movie with great animation, as some of the odd animation made me dizzy. The first half mainly focuses on Gwen and her encounter with Spider-man 2099. Although I may have missed the tragedy in her universe, the movie expands the Spiderverse and introduces The Spot as a new villain, shedding new light on Miles Morales as the new Spider-man. The scene to keep an eye out for is when Miles is bitten by the spider, leading to a shocking conclusion that will permanently alter him. Overall, this film is a continuation, and I'm excited for the next installment.","

"demonblade-37792","5 June 2023","The first impression of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is that the cinematography is visually stunning. The artwork and animations of the characters and backgrounds are pleasing to watch. Kudos to the artist team who put the hard work in. I loved how we saw almost and if not every Spider-Person from all the universes. My personal favorite was Spider-Punk being played by Daniel Kaluuya because he is a punk-rock character, but also still chill and nonchalant at the same time. It was glad seeing Miles Morales (Shamiek Moore) back in action as his and also Spider-Gwen's (Hailee Steinfield) stories dissolve all into one movie. It was nice to see that we have strong antagonists being played by Spot (Jason Schwartzman) and Spider-Man 2099/ Miguel O' Hara (Oscar Isaac). Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is great with its voice acting, cinematography, and the story. I would recommend watching it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!","

"jyszxpxqfhrg","15 January 2024","There is too much going on in this film. It shows in both the runtime and pacing. They were trying to go too big too fast. It should've been multiple different movies. Gwen could've had her own film based on the introduction.You don't get enough time to relate with the characters or appreciate the story beats. They just keep whipping you from one major event to another. There are also several weird plot holes as a result. It just brain my mind numb by the end.This remind me of Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. The writers wanted to squeeze a whole cinematic universe's worth of content into one movie. Some people may love the ambition, but I just don't see the masterpiece everyone else is talking about.","

"cardsrock","7 June 2023","It's truly incredible how good of a follow-up this is to one of the best comic book films ever. The fact they managed to craft this compelling of a story without it feeling forced is amazing. I was full invested in everything happening and couldn't believe the end of the film came so soon. That; however, would be the one aspect holding me back from a perfect score, as this almost feels like an incomplete film given the lack of resolution with Miles' story. However, Gwen is arguably the co-lead of the film and she gets some nice resolution with her arc.Speaking of Gwen, the visuals utilized for her world were truly out of this world. Having the colors of the world sync with her emotions really gave this a unique feel. The rest of the visuals in the film were of course exquisite as well.There are SO many nods and references to Spider-Man across media and I loved every second of it. Lord and Miller continue their impeccable track record of clever writing with genuinely funny dialogue. I hope we see more of Miguel O'Hara in the sequel, as he is a fascinating character superbly voiced by Oscar Isaac. I must also make note of the incredible score. It might be even better than the first film with its whirlwind of electric sounds and vibes.Across the Spider-Verse stands as one of the best sequels ever and one of the best comic book films of all time. I really cannot recommend this film enough if you're interested in going on an incredible multi-versal journey full of heart and soul.","

"vishalmellark","4 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse strikes the perfect chord, like a symphony of web-slinging hilarity. It swings through the cinematic landscape with impeccable pacing, juggling character development and action like a circus performer on caffeine. The voice acting is A-grade, with Isaac brooding so intensely that I could swear his voice could rival thunder. Hailee Steinfeld shines as Gwen, blending her previous roles into a cocktail of awesomeness. And let's not forget Moore, who's simply ""freaking amazing"" as Morales, showcasing maturity and immaturity in a way that would make even a hormonal spider proud. The storytelling is as fresh as a spider web spun by a hipster arachnid, blending nostalgia, comedy, and superheroism in a way that leaves you saying, ""Wow, superheroes can be deep and funny!"" The comedy is a riot, hitting you with more punchlines than a spider web has sticky threads, and the nostalgia and Easter eggs are like a treasure hunt for cinephiles and comic book aficionados. The action scenes are a step up from the first film, delivering more kicks, flips, and whips than a salsa dancing Spider-Man. The animation and art style are a visual feast, like watching a kaleidoscope of comic book pages come to life in a mind-bending acid trip. Sure, there are a few hiccups along the way, like some forced humor and moments of pacing hiccups, but hey, nobody's perfect, not even Spider-Man. The ending may drag on a bit, like that one friend who can't take a hint to leave the party, but it's still a wild ride that'll make you want to spin back for more. So grab your popcorn, slip into your Spidey suit, and get ready for an adventure that'll make you laugh, cheer, and leave you itching for the next installment. Spider-fans, this one's for you!","

But hey, it was still beautifully done! Everything else inclusive!The best storytelling by far as you have beautifully animated characters with lifelike emotional facial cues, deep and meaningful dialogue in every aspect of the story from very memorable characters and a near perfect musical score that plays to the beat of the oncreen action/drama.I also love that the multiverse is more than just the storyline for this movie. It includes the stories from all the Spider-Man iterations from over the years.The way each character old and new is re/introduced shows how much care went into this beautifully crafted movie.

"kuteguy","17 August 2023","I loved the first one. Spoke so highly of it and recommended it to all my friends for how intricate and interesting the plot is. I was looking forward to this new installment but very disappointing that it was a long movie without an ending.Suddenly, in the last 20 minutes, when the energy was going up to a 10, from an 8, and more and more complexity was being introduced.. I knew it. I can't believe they are doing it to animated movies now ('cartoons'). Why is the movie not feeling like I will have the itch scratched. 'to be continued..' .. knew it!!Not cool to do that, especially when they introduced more and more open loops. To do it with animated movies now? Seriously, the money grabbing just never stops.","

"healingtoolbox","6 June 2023","Probably the most on-point, on-time zeitgeist expression since, well, 2018's Spiderverse film.The high point of wonders here for me comes late in the 2nd act when Miles and his mom talk alone. The mom is the most successful animated character in this film. The film goes on for another 20 minutes of wonderful lyrical visuals. Then I lost track of the plot almost completely. How a multiverse is affected by tangled webs of various Spider-people didn't work as an emotional thru-line for me.ANIMATION JAZZ returns! Animation nerds will know many effects here hark back to animation experiments in the 1950s-1960s of John and Faith Hubley et al. Generally these old pretentious visual effects are put to much better story use here--if several times overdone to the point of sensory overload.DC comics fans will note the Green Lantern Corps clearly inspired the Spider-person Corps here. Be ready for several jolting new spider-personas. I liked their choices.This is another movie which would play longer in theaters if 20 minutes of bloat was cut out; in this case, from end of 2nd act.","

"brandoconner-83700","2 June 2023","The animation was absolutely amazing along with the action and soundtrack. Miles and Gwen definitely feel more fleshed out in this one, however I feel that some of the dialogue gets to be a bit too corny and tries to hard to be quirky. I expected Miguel to have more of a role aside from the final 30 minutes of the movie, same goes for the villain who is introduced with a rushed backstory who only makes 1 more appearance in the entire second half of the movie. I did have a good time watching it and it's by no means a bad movie, just not the ""Masterpiece"" everyone is building it up to be and is certainly not, ""The Greatest Animated Movie Of All Time"".","

"roaches_97","6 June 2023","Across the Spider Verse is a very solid movie. It's not the masterpiece that the insane hype train would have you believe, but it's very good. As of right now, this movie has a higher IMDb score than some of the greatest movies of all time (Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, all the Lord of the Rings movies) and I don't really think it's deserved. I'm sure it will be a lot better to look back on once part two comes out, but as of right now it does feel like half of a movie. The animation and voice acting are both great, it has good action, and some of the references and visual gags were cool. I would recommend seeing this in the theater, but I'd say wait a few weeks. I saw it opening weekend in a theater packed full of drooling fanboys who cheered at every single reference. It was maybe the worst theater experience I've ever had. I don't think it's as great as the first but it was a good movie.","

"elhamfirmino","2 June 2023","I went to the premier with high expectations and came back happy with a drill of anticipation for continuation. This film sets completely new standards from which every studio can learn something.FilmAt the beginning we dive into Gwen's world and shockingly you realize in disbelief how the animation has developed after 5 years. The graphics, transitions, transition of specific colors, the movement of the characters, facial expressions and the atmosphere is unbelievably good. I mean the first movie already made you feel you go through a comic, but Across The Spider-Verse is the next level of animation. With approximately 150.000.000$ budget the result is impressive and totally worth it. I loved every bit of it and no 140 minutes didn't fell too long. When the film was over I was like go on do another 2 hours I WANT MORE OF THIS. Huge respect to Chris Miller & Phil Lord and the entire crew for making this possible.The plot no spoilerIt takes place 16 months after the events of the fire movie. Miles Morales is Spider-Man and has to deal with the daily businesses. He struggles to keep his relationship with his parents, always comes late and has little to no time. One day he faces The Spot a new villain and from there I leave you out without spoilers. The Spot fits in this topic and movie so good. He was the right choice. His design is crazy and his motives are so well written.MultiverseI have to say Across The Spider-Verse did catch the Multiverse topic perfectly. MCU needs to note so many things here. It's actually insane how great they showed the possibilities, diversities and complexities of it. For me, they surpassed No Way Home in terms of Multiverse. Of course Animation is a different tool, but still the story telling and how they made you feel like this movie is not only for kids it's actually more complex and for fans and more like for everyone. The concept of that was nailed perfect. You really do not feel twisted or lost like in several MCU Multiverse projects.To come to an conclusion I think it's safe to say this movie is gonna win another Oscar and is so far in a great cinema year for me the best movie. Wow, I'm so grateful for this movie. I want to watch it again. Go to the cinema right now. This is a true masterpiece. 10/10 Genre and overall everything was perfect. The voice actors did an amazing job too.","

"hoernkeem","18 August 2023","Eric's Grade: A
'Across the Spider-Verse' is the animated sequel to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse' and is set to be followed by 'Beyond the Spider-Verse'. With Sony's ownership of the Spider-Man character this is their conduit for continuing to tell Spider-Man stories, and, while Peter Parker makes an appearance, this is once again a Miles Morales led story who is probably the most popular non Peter Parker Spidey from the comics. There are numerous recurring roles from the first film foremost among them being Shameik Moore as Miles, Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales and Brian Tyree Henry as Jeff Morales. Notable supporting voice cast includes Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara, Issa Rae as Jess Drew and Jason Schwartzman as the Spot. 'Across the Spider-Verse' uses the same stylized animation and carries over the feel and tone from the first film flawlessly. That achievement is made more impressive by the fact none of the directors are the same from the first film and the only writer that remains the same is Phil Lord. This will certainly land on numerous end of the year lists and is easily a frontrunner for Best Animated Feature. 'Across the Spider-Verse' is a tremendous box office success as well taking in over $680 million at the box office on $100 million budget.We initially encounter Gwen Stacy from the previous film who, in the midst of a battle with an enemy that has spilled over from the multiverse, reveals to her father that she is Spider-Woman. When he shuns her she turns to the Spider-People who have showed up and they grant her acceptance/asylum in there multiverse Spider-society. Meanwhile Miles is doing his Spider-Man thing his way on Earth-1610. He laments the loss of love interest Gwen, has typical awkward teenage interaction with his parents and battles evil super villains with his own brand of Spidey humor mixed in. One such villain is The Spot and is easily foiled by Spider-Man although, little does Miles know, this villain shall return much more powerful, determined and ruthless than before. All of a sudden Gwen returns, but she is a tad stand offish and secretive. Miles discovers that she is part of a secret Spider-Society headed by Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Man 2099. Miles follows Gwen into a portal to the Spider-Society's HQ where he discovers, to his shock, why he has been generally shunned by this society, and why all of a sudden the majority of the Spider-People turn against him. He flees seeking to write his own story and not have it written for him. He flees to save himself and his family. He flees into what he thinks is relative safety until a fairly massive plot twist leads into a cliffhanger ending that will leave fans drooling for the third installment of this series.Holy Spider-People Batman! If you thought the handful of odd Spidey's from 'Into the Spider-Verse' was jarring wait until you encounter a world(dimension?) full of them. There is so much going on in this movie that it is hard to quantify. The action and animation are stellar along with all of the voice cast. There is some genuine, heartfelt emotion that comes through as well with regard to Miles and his family, Gwen and her father and Miles and the Spider Society including Gwen. For the most part the writers do an excellent job of reigning in a very confusing, chaotic subject and keeping it focused and coherent. That said there are a few story elements that don't quite make sense to me. The crux of Miguel's fixed intensity at Miles is that Miles is an anomaly that was never meant to be Spider-Man due to the fact the spider that bit him was from another reality. If that is truly such a bad thing though I have no understanding why Miguel and his transdimensional Spidey task force allow Miles to go unmolested until he literally shows up at Spider HQ. Also if Gwen truly knew what was going on I have no understanding why she ever went back to visit Peter putting him, and the fabric of reality, in tremendous danger. Besides that..... pretty solid. I had a blast with this. I recently re-watched 'Into the Spider-Verse' and loved it more than I remembered. This is essentially more of the same just expanded to the point that it will melt your brain.... In a good way! The twist cliffhanger ending is a stroke of genius that ranks up there with some of the best cliffhanger endings ever in movies. For a two and half hour run time, which is the longest ever for an American animated film, the movie flies by. It would honestly be difficult to make this movie better, and I cannot wait for future Miles Morales content in this wondrous Spider-rific world.","

"pedrocf14","12 June 2023","Just watched this amazing masterpiece and all i can say is WOW.I went into the cinema expecting a good movie but i never thought that i was about to watch the best Spider-Man movie EVER and probably the movie of the year! This sequel DESERVES nominations fellas!From the moment the movie starts until the very end you are HOOKED.The animation and character designs are absolutely amazing, all of the fight scenes are so well done and ""choreographed"", what a fantastic job by the animation team.The soundtrack is great and really fits into the movie and the characters like a glove.The pace is exquisite and really allows the characters to develop and show growth as the story progresses whilst we, the viewers, dont lose interest in it.An incredible amount of references are made in this movie to different Spider-Man Universes, such has Andrew Garfields, Tom Hollands and even the video game Spider Man gets a shout out! What a really fun way to acknowledge all the past Spider-Mans and to show that they really are all connected and to put Miles Morales Spider-Man next to all the other ones.The humor was actually surprising, because even though you are expecting to laugh when watching a Spider-Man movie, this sequel has really good timing on most of the jokes and one of the funniest characters of any Marvel franchise, in Spider Punk. Kudos to Daniel Kaluuya for giving us such a voice acting performance.This is, without a doubt, the best movie i have watched this year. It has emotions, growth and action, all we need in a super hero movie.It ends with a much expected cliff hanger for the next one and you best believe im going to watch it as soon as it comes out.9.5/10 - Absolutely Amazing.","

"ryanpersaud-59415","12 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is quite possibly the best sequel I've seen in a LONG time.It not only expands upon the original, but represents an improvement in almost every way. By the way, the original is an excellent, 9/10 film too, so...yeah, this is heavy, heavy praise] The visuals are absolutely STUNNING, so much so that multiple times whilst watching this movie, I thought to myself ""how is this even possible?"" I can't recall the last time a live action movie really made me feel that way. The commitment to comic book aesthetic is incredible and lovingly crafted in each frame; but what's more impressive is that this film has the ambition to go beyond even that: blending 3D animation with live action, 2D animated with 3D, mosaics with moving rotoscoped characters. I can honestly say that I feel lucky to be able to watch films in the 2020s, Across the Spider-Verse represents one of the best examples of technology and artistry coming together to make something unbelievably cool.And, the amazing thing is that all of this visual excellence exists in service of a great story. Narratively, Across the Spider-Verse represents a more mature, high stakes, thoughtful, well constructed instalment of the franchise; the characters are relatable and understandable, their motivations clear as day. There's a real humanity to the story, despite the bombast and multiversal storytelling. At its core, its about family, identity, self-discovery, community...universal themes that anyone could get behind. There are also so many genuinely great performances bringing these characters to life; shout out in particular to Daniel Kaluuya and Oscar Isaac, but honestly, the whole cast is great. They're so good that if you told me the voice actors sat down with the animators and saw what they were supposed to look and move like, I'd believe you.Speaking of movement, the action sequences in this film are truly incredible. The fluidity of the characters' movements, the fantastic editing and use of comic book panels (a really valuable tool to ensure everything can be seen), and aforementioned excellent visual effects stack up with the best live action scenes Hollywood has to offer.I also personally believe a superhero tale is only as good as its villain, and wow, this movie did a fantastic job. I love how Spot (played by the excellent Jason Schwartzmann) initially comes off as a joke, only for his true potential (and power) to slowly be revealed throughout the movie. I kind of wish he was in it longer, but Oscar Isaac's Miguel works as another amazing antagonist as well.And the ENDING. MY GOD. Could this movie have set its sequel up even better? My wife and I were sitting in the theatre, ready for another half hour or so, expecting the climax only to realize when the music began to swell that it was over. I was genuinely so impressed with how well the filmmakers put all the chess pieces on the board for the next one. However, because of that, if there was one thing keeping this movie from being perfect to me, it's that the ending isn't here yet. It still feels like half of a movie, so how this movie really stacks up in the grand scheme of things is unknown until Part II.Into the Spider-Verse represented a revolution in American animation, where the Pixar style commitment to replicating the real world was eschewed in favour of fluid, unapologetic, stylized animation (so much so that Pixar itself is copying Sony Pictures Animation). I feel like Across the Spider-Verse is throwing the gauntlet, passionately arguing that animation could and SHOULD be taken as seriously as live action.","

"afeey","29 June 2023","After the explosion of the super collider, there is a growing threat to all known worlds. The nature, identity and responsibility of being a Spider-person is examined.This is much bigger than the first, and they even manage to address the rare flaws: this time, despite the many universes and literally hundreds of characters, it never loses focus on Miles Morales (Moore, spot-on), and the creative, memorable action scenes are now each completely, not only mostly, unique. Considering what I just described, you might not believe me when I say that somehow this manages to not be completely overwhelming. That they managed to make the concept simultaneously infinite in possibility and yet not let it get overpowering.","

"moviemanmo","2 June 2023","The movie does a great job catching the audience up with Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy. While we catch up to what's going on in their lives presently, we are also reminded of the events that took place in the previous film thus connecting both stories into one.Miles is the only Spider-man in his world and is dealing with that inner conflict. At the same time the film shows that Gwen Stacy is dealing with similar feelings. The characters are parallel to one another and even their family dynamics are similar as they deal with the issue of revealing to their families their true identity. This further adds to the idea of the spider-verse and how similar characters are dealing with similar issues although they are still unique.Gwen Stacy's backstory is explained in detail setting up some emotional moments between her and her father making this film feel grounded and relatable. Not only is it emotional but it also sets up perfectly her reason for joining the other Spider-men.Meanwhile Miles's story is used to introduce the new villain ""Spot"". The buildup to this character was very cool because it made the audience view him exactly how Miles Morales did while the movie was taking place. Spot initially felt like a dumb villain but then he turned into a serious threat and the build up to it was perfect.Miguel O'Hara was another cool character introduced in this film and I liked how his story and intentions were used to further explain how the Spider-verse works. He also added to the drama of the story and provided some intense moments throughout the film.There were so many cool cameos but it was done in a unique way that flowed with the story and not for the sake of including it. There are too many variations of Spider-man to mention but they were all very cool, it was a treat every time a different one was on screen. Also, all of the parents in this film felt organic and true to how parents would deal with the situations that were taking place.This film brought back the comic book style from the last film but it added upon it. When the story was taking place in Gwen Stacy's world the animation style was different than in Miles Morales' world and that attention to detail doesn't go unnoticed. This film gushes with style and blossoms with colors. It's just visually stunning all around. The character designs were just pure art especially with characters like Spider-punk and Spider-man India. The voice acting was amazing. All of the voices suited the characters and never felt out of place.This movie had a lot more heart and drama than the first film with an even better story. The conflict in this story is truly gripping and is intensified with each scene. It is all explained in great detail without being complex or convoluted. This movie was also funnier than the last one but it was never forced or took away from what was going on.This movie is entertaining from beginning to end. It will leave you wanting more by the time it ends. This is easily the best film of the year thus far without comparison. It did everything the first film did but better. This was truly a perfect movie.","

Like I mentioned in the title! The film made me want to watch it for 3 times and never get bored one single bit. That is how you know it's a great movie. In fact i have not had an awesome time like that since Infinity war or no way home. It just delivers! It's a film for everyone out there. So go ahead and enjoy it yourselves! And make your own opinion. Let's hope when the actual Miles Morales's movie will come out, it will turn out to be exactly like this version of him. We need more of that!","

Recommendation without hesitation.On a side node: This is how you make poc people being represented well. Not randomly switching skin colors, but making great characters of their own. At this point Morales is literally edging on the popularity of Peter Parker. Just make cool characters!If you're unsure; Watch it.","

"ZeroMajor","1 June 2023","Never would have thought this movie would be 'MILES' better than its prequel, the countless amount of easter eggs for the Spider-fans, along with an engaging story that had its fun parts of action and meaningful interactions between well-thought out characters without losing the pace or intensity of the story. Across the Spider-Verse is a testament of immaculate craftsmanship from the passion and hard work done by the animators and writers of the prequel. The pacing is splendidly well-done, even the times where nothing major happens in the story is filled to the brim with fun interactions that breathe character to the people we all love in this story. I'll be waiting for Beyond the Spider-Verse next year. Go above and beyond!","

"rhbouchard","12 July 2023","The theme that teenagers know better than their parents has been done to death. ""They don't know me"" is also a tired cliche. Lotsa flashes of color seem pointless other than to get the ADHD generation's attention and to stretch out the running time. The first half is rather dreary. The second half is more interesting with more plot twists than an O. Henry anthology, but by then I'd lost interest and resented that they made me sit through the first half. The end is a shameless ""To Be Continued"". You would think the writers would have followed the multiverse underpinning and came up with something more original and succinct.","

"chris_rowe-881-168820","8 June 2023","People are so insanely creative and talented, I mean I love superhero movies and animated ones but this is next level. The story is brilliant, the humour is great but there's so much to it, there's literally emotions being shown to you via art, colours and textures, it's phenomenally deep and nuanced for a film you'd probably write off as being a kids movie.Script is great, attention to detail is perfect sbc the links to all the other parts of the Spider-Man universes was really clever to, some hilarious cameos and a great nemesis who had the whole audience laughing.I'd actually say I now prefer these to the in real life movies.As close to perfection as possible.","

"Anurag-Shetty","13 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse continues with the adventures of Miles Morales(Shameik Moore), after the events of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018). Miles swings across the Multiverse, where he meets a huge team of Spider-People charged with safeguarding it. When all these various heroes disagree on how to handle a new sinister villain, Miles must dig deep & reinvent what it means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers & Justin K. Thompson have given us a movie that not only matches up to the masterpiece that is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018), but somehow manages to surpass it. The multiple Easter eggs referencing Spidey's appearances in various forms of media over the years, is absolutely delightful to witness. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. There are many scenes that will make you guffaw uncontrollably. There are many emotional scenes that will tug at your heartstrings & will make you tear up, too. All in all, the perfect ingredients that gives the viewers the best Spider-Man film of all time, even surpassing the superlative Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). The animation is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Kudos to the animators for continually pushing the envelope in the Spider-Verse franchise. The vocal performances are the highlight of the movie. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Hailee Steinfeld is outstanding as Gwen Stacy. Brian Tyree Henry is phenomenal as Jeff Morales. Luna Lauren Velez is amazing as Rio Morales. Jake Johnson is awesome as Peter B. Parker. Oscar Isaac is fantastic as Miguel O'Hara. Jason Schwartzman is brilliant as Spot. Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Karan Soni & Shea Whigham are excellent as Jessica Drew, Hobie Brown, Pavitr Prabhakar & George Stacy, respectively. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must watch for Spidey fans & pretty much everyone else. Watch it on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. Eagerly waiting with bated breath for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse(2024)!","

"view_and_review","14 August 2023","Wow, I was so amazed by this movie I watched it twice in two days. I liked the first movie. I loved the sequel. I can't wait for part three.""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" picks up with Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) a couple of years older, in a new suit, and killin' the Spider-Man thing. Being Spider-Man has its drawbacks though. He's been missing school and his tardiness to different events has caused a strain between him and his parents, Jeff and Rio Morales (voiced by Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Velez).A rather innocuous battle with a villain named Spot (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) made Miles late to his father's retirement party which was the straw that broke the camel's back. His parents were fed up with Miles' behavior and his lame excuses.Before the movie jumped into Miles' story we got a glimpse of Gwen Stacy (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld) and what she was going through in her universe. She was having an even tougher time as her father, George (voiced by Shea Whigham), believed that she (as Spider-Woman) was responsible for the death of her best friend. She was saved from handcuffs by Miguel O'Hara (voiced by Oscar Isaac), the leader of an inter-universe Spider-beings legion that was responsible for preventing anomalies in the various universes. It was a big deal.Miles found himself at the HQ of the inter-universe Spider-Beings legion though he was uninvited. Things only got more dramatic from there.I was so deeply engaged in this movie I couldn't tell you if I was breathing or not. I'm sure I didn't blink. The movie got better and better as it went along. It was far deeper than I ever expected it to be and tons more entertaining. The storyline is perfection and some of the best writing I've ever seen from a comic book superhero movie.Some people have complained about the animation style. I say, ""Oh ye of little knowledge and appreciation."" The animation, which was a blend of various styles, was brilliant. Every style was a version of comic book illustration. Hobie (voiced by Daniel Kaluuya), who was Spider-Punk, wasn't even animated, he was a still illustration drawn in different poses and different positions and yet he was one of my favorites!I had zero complaints. Even the ending only made me pine for more. And Spot, that seemingly weak villain... yeah, even he got more awesome as the movie progressed. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is a welcome addition to the Spider-Man collection and it has supplanted many of the existing Spider-Man movies.","

"JaredLegend","31 May 2023","It was nothing short of spectacular and amazing. I didn't think they could surpass the animation of the first one, but this one clearly did. I was tearing up, not only because of how emotional it gets, but because of how beautiful the visuals are. I really liked that it was just good animation for the sake of good animation, because believe me, it was really good. But the good animation also served as somewhat of a way to differentiate between different universes. And by conditioning the viewers into thinking this, the twist is able to really shock them when it is revealed. Already can't wait for the next one!","

"sme3","3 July 2023","For the most part SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE maintains the high-quality of its predecessor while offering plenty of new experiences. The animation is beautiful and eye-popping. The story features plenty of action, some humor, and much heart. Some of the goodwill this excellent film inspires in its audience is squandered by the words ""To Be Continued."" After spending almost two and a half hours building up a complex story and concern for its characters, this film provides no resolution to any of its plot elements, making the end of the film disappointing and frustrating.Miles Morales returns for the next chapter of the Oscar®-winning Spider-Verse saga, an epic adventure that will transport Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.","

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","22 September 2023","Without fail, I have watched wildly successful movies gain sequels that were too big for just one movie. The latest entry in this Trilogy Conundrum is none other than the animated Spider-Verse series. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) was a stylish and refreshing animated film that won the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Its sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023), is equally good in both storytelling and animation. However, the size of such a story being stretched over two films affected some of this movie's pacing.I am increasingly becoming a fan of the ""stylized"" animated movies like Into the Spider-Verse and Across the Spider-Verse. Pixar can show how realistic CGI animation can be, but I found truly creative CGI animation in other studios like this one. This ""cartoony"" style lends itself to the humor of the fight between Miles (Shameik Moore) and Spot (Jason Schwartzman). It's also versatile enough to be serious when it needs to be. If anything, it is able to highlight the visual differences between the different universes.Superfans of the Spider-Man franchise likely got tons of references from decades of Spider-Man iterations. Even if this is your first introduction to the character, it's likely you already know about the ""canon events"" that make up the central theme of this movie. Although it was enjoyable to see Spider-Man in different settings, the film's second half was sluggish as it built up to the next movie's premise. Not knowing where they were going to cut to a ""To Be Continued"" card made the last bit seem endless. Still, I'm excited to watch the last part of this trilogy since the first two parts have been solid.A solid Trilogy Conundrum entry in the Spider-Verse saga, I give Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 4.5 stars out of 5.","

"athanasiosze","2 December 2023","I watched "" Into the Spider-Verse"" last night, it was so much better than i expected. I thought i was too old for this but as it seems, age does not matter when it comes to a good movie. A good movie is a good movie, irregardless of its genre or its targeted audience. So, i decided to watch ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE too.It was orgasmic, non stop action, it was like every second was a different chapter, sort to speak. I am sure that several things went unnoticed and a second view will help. Either way, this was impressive and amazing. Now i will say something that will sound inconsistent and contradictory. I rated 7.5/10 the first movie and 8/10 this movie. I believe that first movie (ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE) is better though. It's more coherent and well structured, even more ""substantial"" i believe. However, i gave ACROSS THE SPIDERVERSE a better rating even if it's a bit more flawed. That's because this movie is an achievement. I have a soft spot for overambitious movies, especially when i see that the creators are determined to create a masterpiece. In general, when they go for something different than usual.So, i don't care this is too stuffed, chaotic and messy. There were moments that gave me goosebumbs, there were scenes i felt like a child again watching my favorite scifi/fantasy movies. I've felt nostalgic so i don't care about the flaws. This was an insane experience and the last 30 minutes with all those twists and suspense and the shocking moments were mindblowing.Man, i could never imagine that i would empathize so much with an animation character, being a 45 years old European. Yet, i did. Go get them Miles. I hope the third part of this franchise comes soon.","

"Aziz24","10 July 2023","Synopsis: He is now grown up, more mature, and lived with the Spider Man curse for a year. He seems like he is enjoying it, until it gets really dark. Miles Morals returns once again but this time, it's a more powerful enemy that forces Miles to revisit the past and discover the dark and unhidden secrets of the future. He is now in a different ""spot"".Spider Man Across the Spider-Verse created a whole new Spider man experience for every fan. That's with the help of the visuals, using a more unique animation vibe that sets you up with the mood of the film, more characters, and most importantly, the story that has a very deep meaning behind it.Comparing to the animation style used in the first part that sent animation films into another different level, this time the film discovers new and more advanced techniques to set up the perfect mode and tone for the story.The first film dived in Miles Morales' deep character development with the different changes that he went throughout the whole film. As he becomes Spider Man, we see how he goes through all of those changes and how he will adapt to them. As he discovered more about the harshness of being a superhero and the sacrifices he has to make. However, in this film, Miles' character development gets even more tough especially that it sets it up for the third part as well. Miles is not a kid anymore, and the sacrifices he had to make in the first part, are nothing in compare to the ones in the second part. Voice actor Shameik Moore has a huge part in making all of this possible. By just voicing the character, you can feel the anger, fright, or even the sadness and happiness of the character.Speaking of voice actors, Hailee Steinfeld proves herself again as a solid voice actor for Gwen Stacy. Especially that this film focuses more on that character on a deeper level and her relationship with her dad or with her past traumatic experiences. All of that can be seen in the great opening sequence of the film that is in my opinion, the best Spider Man opening sequences and can be considered to be one of the best opening sequences of a super hero film, of course after The Dark Knight's (2008) opening sequence. Daniel Pemberton's music and the animation colors with it's connection to Gwen Stacy and the many easter eggs that have a deeper meaning behind them.Composer Daniel Pemberton has a music piece titled ""Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)"" in the film that can be heard in the opening sequence specifically in which you can clearly tell that it is expressing Gwen's feelings. Especially that it came up in a scene that included a conversation with her dad in a room and the animation & colors on the walls of the room are inspired by water colors and they were dripping down like whenever the conversation between the daughter and the father gets tense or heated. Small details like this are the reason of making this film the greatest animation film SO FAR and the greatest film to tell a Spider Man story.My rating is 9.5/10Watched on June 2nd, 2023
Format: Digital IMAX.","

"devendralilke","21 August 2023","Miles Morales's story to the next part which traverses through the multiverse. The huge faults create a gigantic messed up cracks and fissures in the symmetrical flow of the timeline. The absolutely astonishing visual style of animation owns this film and teleports it to the place where no other film has reached. This film is bonkers in catering countless creative choices in its every fascinating frame, each looks like a spectacle at best. The graphics and artwork creatively screams and mellows us with its perfect comic style representation. The mega chase sequence with the spider society is an amusing ride. The action sequences are rushing pulses which standout and validify the reason why we shall blow our minds in front of the big screen. The creation team and art team of this film outperforms the first installment and establishes a benchmark for the future of animation. The humour and emotions find a way in this splendid world. The storytelling and narration is well webbed in the long pacing. Miles Morales's appealing storyline is intertwined with multiple other plots across the spider-verse. Gwen's character is a shining lamplight. All the other spideys from different worlds make a place to form the intriguing exploration of the multiverse. The spot is really an unique character choice to add on in the multiverse trajectory. Miles Morales's bond with his parents is an inspiration upon which the story finds a heart and soul. In here also, there is this fate of spiderman, that he or she has to make a sacrifice to withhold the power that flows in him. As every time, the stirring and insightful words from the mentors of spiderman thrives that matters in every storyline to serve the purpose that every superhero needs. The film often softens from its epic tone like a subtle colour to penetrate the bulky ambition and poignant emotions it carries. Probably the finest Spidey film to date. It ends with a cliffhanger, promising a beyond trek. Indeed, this film is a fabulous work of art that reminds us that there is no frontier to creation. It has just pulled us into its world of millions of our own-selves...","

"AntonioBollo","20 August 2023","This was a perfect movie to complement ""Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse"". I mean everything from the acting, animation, plot, twist/turns and much more was just astonishing. Complements to everyone but specifically Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld. They both do such an amazing job portraying there characters not inly in the first film but somehow manage to do even better on the second. I love the way both Shameik and Hailee along with the animators fill us in on the gap from the first movie to this one, between the transitions and colors.If you are a Spider-Man fan this is a very great film. The great thing about this movie is if you are a fan of Spider-Man you don't necessarily need to watch the first movie to have this one make sense.","

I really wish they'd cut down on useless scenes and add a good, substantial ending kind of like part 1. I was also expecting more of Pavitr and Punk, also there was literally no Noire which made me sad. I honestly feel sad after watching the movie, I was waiting for it to end by the time intermission ended. I watched it in 4d and I honestly don't know what to say, it was meh. I'm hoping for part 3 to be better and make up for it. Feel like my money is somewhat wasted, but the animation was great. Story was stirring up well, but again same point, they ended it too abruptly.","

"rexmatthewj","1 June 2023","Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a dazzling sequel that takes Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy on a multiverse-hopping adventure with a new team of Spider-People. The film expands the Spider-Verse in creative and exciting ways, introducing new characters, worlds and threats, while also exploring Miles' personal journey as a hero and a friend.The film follows Miles (Shameik Moore), who is still learning to be Spider-Man and has feelings for Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld). He is recruited by her to join a mission to stop the Spot (Jason Schwartzman), a villain who can open portals to different dimensions. Along the way, Miles meets Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), who leads a group of Spider-People from different universes known as spider-society. However, Miles soon clashes with Miguel and his group over how to handle the Spot and his mysterious plan.The film is a visual spectacle, with amazing animation that displays the diversity and creativity of the Spider-Verse. Each universe has its own flair and mood. The action sequences are exciting and original, using the Spot's portals to create dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. The film also nods to various Spider-Man comics, movies and shows, with references and Easter eggs that will please fans.The voice cast is excellent, with Moore and Steinfeld returning as Miles and Gwen with charisma and chemistry. Isaac shines as Miguel, who acts as a mentor and rival to Miles, while Schwartzman is a charming and threatening villain as the Spot.

Parker, Brian Tyree Henry as Jefferson Morales, Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales and introduces new cast members such as Issa Rae as Jessica Drew / Spider-Woman, Karan Soni as Pavitr Prabhakar / Spider-Man India, Daniel Kaluuya as Hobart ""Hobie"" Brown / Spider-Punk, Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099, and many more cameos.The film is not only a spectacle, but also a heartfelt story that explores Miles' growth as a hero and a person.

"jacobmorel-21340","5 June 2023","When the first spider verse movie ended it was clear that Sony was going to make a sequel. I knew going into this movie the action and story were going to probably be better than the first. What I didn't know was that I was walking into one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. And that goes for both live action and animated films. From the moment it started to end I was hooked. The story was funny, dramatic, and enjoyable in a way that made me feel like the characters and story was actually real. And not just some mundane made up sci-fi story that's already been told a thousand times. By the end of the movie I was left wanting to see more, which for some movies is a bad thing, but for this movie I was only wanting more cause of how great everything I saw was. With the third movie coming out next year, I will be eagerly waiting for the story to continue.","

Usually movies that have a sequel aren't the good since the first one turns out to be better. But not this one, the the second movie topped its original with flying colors. Highly recommend to anyone even if they aren't a fan of Spider-Man or Marvel. It's a fun movie for anyone to enjoy! In all honesty, the movie had me calling out every cameo/easter egg I could find since it was filled with them. And I never do that for any movie. And if there is anything I could take away from this movie, it's, ""everyone's telling me how my story is supposed to go...nah, imma do my own thing.""","

Meanwhile Miles and Gwen work as exciting characters, while still having great chemistry between each other.This film is a masterpiece, and by far the best spider man film of all time, I would definitely recommend across the spider verse!","

to watch it. After watching ITSV I keep asking myself ' Where Am I? 'After watching ITSV for 8 hours Now I'm ready for ATSV. When I walked out the cinema I was shocked. Ok Sony this one is PHENOMENAL! I ran out of words after watching it. It's completely an art on the big screen without any doubts. You can't look away from the screen for a second. This movie is in another level of animation now. Every frames are absolutely gorgeous and stunning. Every characters are full of heart. The story is beyond my expectations and I'm sure that yours too. Just three words for it ""I Love It""If you love spiderman(s), If you love Marvel, If you love animation, If you love Movies or If you are a guy spending your time at the cinema every weekend like me.GO WATCH IT!!","

We see that Miles has grown in many ways but is still figuring out who he is. We learn more about Gwen and her background and how that connects her to Miles. I connected to their characters and related to their experiences. We also are introduced to new versions of Spiderman throughout the spider-verse and each character brings more delight.Overall the animation remains ahead of the game and is thrilling to see on the big screen. I love how the story built upon the foundation set by Into the Spider-verse without feeling boring. I honestly didn't want this film to end.","

It has so many little details that you've 100% missed. The story is also amazing. The characters all have great writing and some with unique art styles like spider-punk having different art styles almost everytime we see him because he hates consistensy. Speaking of spider-punk he's definetly my fav character. I hope he gets more screen time in the 3rd installation, beyond the spider-verse.

"Nyc_Don_DrKing","4 June 2023","Soooo where do I start...after watching the film 2x so far back to back days & going again for a 3rd time. I think back to the 1st film. Before the film started I asked myself HOW? HOW in the hell is SONY going to top the 1st entry to Miles. We know SONY has mishandled their Spidey IP in the live action department with a few given exceptions...So as I watched Gwen's story pulled LITERALLY from the comics to big screen & watched Spider-India, Spider-Punk with a twist,Scarlet Spider & the PLETHORA of Spidey characters in all its MAGNIFICENCE hit the screen. At the end of the film I answered my own question...THIS!..THIS IS HOW THEY DO IT! & I'll be damned, they SURELY did. The various art animation styles, the color palette usage, when they focused on each specific Spidey character at the time. The story arc being told & arcs they pulled from, with that creme de la creme twist myself & my son picked out once we saw Mile's mom face & knew immediately where they were going...perfection...left you begging for more. You could've told me to sit there for another 2 1/2 hrs & I would have not mind AT ALL. Knowing ahead of time this was always a 2 part film already had me excited, EVEN MORE after that ending. The group that was assembled towards the end my my my goodness. The gems of Easter eggs ontop of Easter eggs & other get you amped up surprises. At its core it had its drama & deep family story to tell, it had action, it had comedy it had suspense, it had it all, but 1st & foremost, the CORE concepts of what makes Spider-Man..Spider-Man, were showcased through & through. You can tell from the director, down to every single person/department involved with these 2 films well 3 😏hopefully soon thoroughly love the character/characters.","

"phiup","14 August 2023","This movie was convoluted as a it could be.First 10 minutes are set up for gwen.Next 35 minutes are set up for Multiverse.Next 30 minutes are set up for Miles's actual story arch.We finally arrive at the rising action about 1 hr and 30 minutes into the movie. With climax being...dun dun dun...to be continued.This movie was awful.They over played the art style. Like really, each universe needs its own art style. Truth be told it detracted from the story. I had to revisit portions because I was taking out of the story by the obnoxious flickering and flowing colors. It worked in the last one cause you used one back ground. But when the background becomes a character...you have no story.And whats more, your main villain is a good guy who will switch to reluctantly following Miles in the next film...who knows, maybe even laying his life down cause Miles made him a believer.YAWN!!! I had to switch to different activities 4 times in this movie because that is how unwatchable this film is.The one compelling character, Spider-punk, was so authentic he is incomprehensible by american audiences. I watch tons of english set films, but they literally had spider-punk mumble his cockney. Absolutely the worst spiderman film ever.","

A must see!I went with my brother and my 9 year old son.My 9 year old said 'oh what it's over already?' ... this kid has never sat through a full film ever.I loved the adult humor , how action packed it was and the new rock spidey had me howling!!! Its a film perfect for the kids to go see , and is fast paced! Personally can't wait for the next one to release!It's a defiantly watch again film , I came home and watched the first one again!This film didn't feel made for imax though , it did wreck the quality of viewing for me but that has no touch on how amazing the film actually was.","

"DanTheMan2150AD","3 June 2023","Across the Spider-Verse is a cataclysmic achievement not only in cinematic storytelling but comic book media in general. All my minor gripes about Into the Spider-Verse are absent and in its place captures the panel-to-panel thrill of reading your first ever Spider-Man comic. Smart, imaginary and completely unrestrained, Across the Spider-Verse might just be the very best Spidey movie ever made in what is an extravagant, very cool love letter to graphic design, executed with superb draftsmanship and giddy, infectious joy.It does lose half a star for the lack of The Emissary from Hell himself (also no 90s Christopher Daniel Barnes Spidey, but that's a personal peeve), although I bet good money he'll be in the next one.","

Everyone should see this weather you like the Spider-Man franchise and with or without kids. Run don't walk. Prepare to have your mind blown! The script is funny, serious and soooo clever! The emotion in this ""cartoon"" (which I feel like it may be offensive to call it that) is superb! My husband and I kept looking at each other in the movie over the kids like whoa! Wow! That's so cool! How did even think about this! Also to add the soundtrack is perfect as well! An all around amazing movie!","

"axelsson11","8 June 2023","It's incredible and almost crazy how they could top the last movie. Into the spider-verse is a very good movie and is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, and it's crazy for me how they could top that movie and make it even better. The hype made me more interested and i looked even more forward to watch this movie, and my expectations for this movie were really high and i expected that this movie was going to be better than the last one, AND IT DID!The voice actors, animators, plot writers, characters and many more did an incredible work! And let's not forget Metro Boomin did an amazing work with the soundtrack. I listened to the soundtrack before i watched the movie to build up some hype, and i still listen to the soundtrack after the movie and can't stop. The animation is so smooth and satisfying to watch, i love the action packed fighting scenes and the romantic and emotional scenes. The relationship between the characters is insane. I also loved how Gwen got a bigger roll and even got her origin revealed in the beginning (i have not read the comics...). It makes her more important in the movie. And what i experienced, this movie was lightly centered around Gwen and not only Miles, which i LOVED. Gwen is certainly an interesting character. And let's not forget Hobie. An amazing guy and probably the funniest character in the movie. The Spot is a great villain. At first i thought he was not serious and felt like he was just a joke. But later in the movie it completely changed and he got way more powerful, which i loved.I really like Sam Reimi's Spider-Man because of nostalgia and that was a big part of my childhood. And the Tom Holland movies are also good, but not as good as Tobey Maguire's performance. However, the Miles Morales movies is right now, by far, my favorite movie of all time and if not the best Spider Man and superhero movies right now. And if the Beyond the Spider-verse is EVEN better than ITSV and ATSV, it'll be the best trilogy ever. No debate.For me, this movie is a 10/10, but if there is something i should ""complain"" about it's that the audio in the beginning was quite low, or maybe it were something in my cinema that was wrong. Nd the CLIFFHANGER. The ending was great and it wasn't bad to include an cliffhanger, i already knew beforehand that the movie were a part 1. But, the cliffhanger left me speechless and made me obsessed with this movie and for the last 4 days, the movie and the theories haven't left my head since.So do i recommend this movie? OH YES, go watch it! It's worth to watch in cinema, the experience will really make this movie even better. Can't wait to see the next movie!(I Apologize if my english is bad)","

"atleverton","6 August 2023","I think this is a good example of the fact that people do not have a superhero fatigue, they just have a limited tolerance for bad movies. This, along with its predecessor, are probably the greatest Spider-Man films of all time. My favorite actor playing Spider-Man, Toby Maguire, but this film shows a believable teenage boy going through the problems of having great responsibility thrust on him. And the animation is stunning. Not only is it breathtaking, but it's expressive. It's some of the best animation in a feature film since the beginning days of Disney. And by that I don't mean cute princesses, but I mean the Psychedelic horror of some parts of Fantasia, the dancing Pink Elephant sequence in dumbo, and the evil queen sequence in snow White. There's a great scene where Gwen is having an emotional moment with her father and the whole color and tone of the animation changes. There are two major flaws with this film though. The first is the ludicrous idea that somehow what happens to spider-Man in is what keeps the universe together. And the other is the ending. The story feels like it can be concluded with a couple of more scenes, they ended it on a cliffhanger they're going to have a lot of filling and padding to extend the length of the next film. But those are minor things to quibble about, this is a masterpiece, the best superhero movies of all time.","

"anon-00001","10 June 2023","So far the greatest movie of 2023, and one of the best I have seen on the big screen in the latest years.Being excited about a movie usually means it won't exceed expectations however this one somehow manages to do just that. With amazing animation, great dialogue and character building it becomes a worthy successor to the first movie and even surpasses it in some ways, while the the first movie had a better score then this one it still succeeds to do better then the predecessor in almost every other way.This movie touches more on building other characters then Miles and let's those other characters shine far more then the first movie let them
All in all I believe the movie deserves many awards and a success in the box office like no other movie released this year.","

"Clank_Zoka","4 June 2023","I love Into the Spider-Verse, it's one of my favourite animated films of all time, it was so impressive and very entertaining , so of course expectations are high with Across the Spider-Verse, I saw it yesterday in IMAX and.. I think I love it as much as Into the Spider-Verse, it not better, it was definitely a full blown experience that was worth every second of it.It has everything that makes animation just special and unique, the big story, outstanding visual styles, gripping drama and amazing characters with funny comedy, I was engaged throughout the film and by the end, I did need to have a think about this unforgettable experience, since it left me with so much mixed emotions, laugher, tears, chills and even getting shocked in some places, it just shows how a sequel can be so much effective and big.So yeah, love it, absolutely love it!, exactly the kind of film we need, it respects animation and cinema at it's best, the best film of the year and nothing can beat it I'm sure, go see it when you can, it's worth the big screen experience.It deservedly gets 10/10.","

"cruise01","5 September 2023","5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse is an awesome animated superhero film that tops the previous film as it continues the Miles Morales storyline and this time taking its setting in other multiverse which him and several other spider mans are trying to stop a villain called the Spot. The action sequences are incredible. Its very stylistic while the animation is an energetic filled that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. Editors and directors were amped up on energy drinks working on this project. The soundtrack and music score is awesome. The story is great. It dives into an emotional connection with Miles responsibility as Spider Man vs. Telling his mom and dad about his secret. While trying to save everyone. The film ends in a bang and a cliffhanger which you ll be anxious for a sequel.Overall, it is one fun wild ride that is a superhero film that is energetic and stylish that wont disappoint to superhero or action fans.","

"exceladeogun","9 July 2023","Spiderman: Across the SpiderverseExactly how a sequel should be - reminiscent of the former movie whilst beautifully building upon it.It's a visual treat, bursting with brilliant and daring animations. Every shot is so stunning that they elicit a 'blink and you miss it' feel.The plot is jumpy, dark and revelatory. Elements from the first movie are deliciously and carefully unfurled. Fanservice and Easter eggs are also abundant. It is also delightful to see how character development is handled. Although the screen time is long, it doesn't become boring or tiring. (Spoiler alert- It ends on a cliffhanger that's so profound and shocking, possibly one of the best I've ever seen, especially as the movie's title doesn't hint at being a 'part one'.)8-9/10.","

"masonfisk","28 June 2023","The current animated Spidey adventure in theaters. Following up on the events from the last feature, Miles Morales, has somewhat settled into his role as the friendly neighborhood webslinger but the eternal schism between doing his duty as a crime fighter & being an upstanding son/student starts to weigh on him especially illustrated as he fights off his self proclaimed nemesis The Spot, voiced by Jason Schwartzman (who'll feature more prominently into the story as it goes along), as he navigates a meeting w/his parents & guidance counselor. A visit from his old friend Gwen Stacey soon thrusts him into a multi-verse (he tagged along w/o her knowing) he knew nothing about (populated by multiple Spider people) which opens his eyes to not only to the universes at large but his essential part in it. Blending hip hop aesthetics to the visuals (which change sometimes from scene to scene much less world to world), we get a visual smorgasbord of references of animated & even in some circumstances live action, Spider people, animals & even his villains in a story which runs the gamut of emotions & incident leaving the viewer punch drunk which in this case is a good thing. The follow-up is slated for next year but w/the writer's strike underway who knows if that berth will hold.","

"KFstudios2009","12 July 2023","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the latest Spider-Man movie, that is animated. I have to admit that I really liked the first movie and was excited for the next one. And my first impression was: wow! Long time since I watched such an epic superhero movie! The plot is basically that Miles Morales (Basically The South-American Spider-Man) have to save the world from colliding with other multiverses and stop a villain called The Spot, that is also about to ruin the world. I want to say more, but I won't because I do not want to spoil. The movie was one great ride. This movie was very fast, so you had to be focused all the time, and It didn't feel 2 and a half hour long, it feelt much shorter. That's because the movie was so fast. The effects were great, I was very impressed. I liked that they made it like a comic-movie, like you got a feeling that you are inside a Superhero comic-book, that was so cool. The music score were well done in this movie, and the cliffhanger at the end was amazing! I really can't wait for the next Miles Morales movie. The characters were showed very good. Miles Morales and his parents do not have the best relationship, and they showed that really good in this movie. Gwen (Spider-Women) was accused for murder by her own father, and she escaped. They showed very good in this movie how bad she feelt. Something that you may have seen in the trailers, like it was also in the movie, that it was many Spider-Mans in the Spider-verse. I think that was very fun and cool. That was one of my favorite things about this movie, actually. Is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, worth watching? I think yes. Especially for Marvel fans, but this movie can be for everyone, if they like action and animated movies. Right now is ""Elemental"" and ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" the best animated movies from 2023 so far.",NA
"28abir","2 July 2023","Following 2018's Into the Spiderverse movie, this sequel was eagerly anticipated by all who had seen the first due to its groundbreaking use of multiple animation styles and clever cinematography which had been little used in the history of animation before. This new slice into Brooklyn spider-man Miles Morales' life did not disappoint.Following his previous explorations into the multiverse (an idea which has now shaped the following phases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe), the film follows Miles' life as he juggles being spider-man with his classes. This sounds like your typical teenage superhero film so far. Alongside his reality, his friend and fellow spiderperson Gwen Stacy's life is also documented in more detail than we had seen in the previous film, explaining the meaning behind her loneliness and need to be the best spider-woman. In the opening of the film, Gwen is conducted into a multiversal group of spiderpeople from every dimension to investigate new threats on the multiverse.The main highlights of the film were definitely the moments of exploring the many multiverses, where the filmmakers had really stretched the boundaries of what an animated superhero film should be. We saw British rock spider-man who's animation style was reflective of collage, Lego spiderman through brick animation, squish mallow spider man and best of all this multiverse of spiderpeople finally allowed clips from the live action films of spider-man to play. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's incarnations of spider-man were represented on screen along with real life cameos from a minor antagonist in Tom Holland's Spiderman Homecoming. A feast for the eyes.I barely have any criticisms, the to be continued ending was frustrating but overall much better than attempting to solve a complex plot twist in 20 minutes. If anything, it compels me to follow everything about and around the third film - Beyond the Spiderverse set to be released in 2024.I will happily watch this film many times and keep finding new animated details and cameos the 200 animators have hidden in every scene every time I watch it. 10 stars for such incredible visuals, cohesive and steady plot, unforced and witty humour, an incredible soundtrack and score and just overall greatness. I didn't think it was possible to top the first film, but they have by bringing the principles of the first film which made it so groundbreaking but hightening and pushing them even further.",NA
"arungeorge13","13 August 2023","3 Writers. 3 Directors. A 2h 20m run-time (yeah, it's the longest animated film produced by an American studio ever). Yet, this is right up there among the best comic book films ever made. I was already astonished by the sheer magic of blending 2D & 3D elements in the first film, and this one takes it up several notches to showcase one of the most visually dazzling films you'll ever see. Yeah, I'm using a lot of superlatives here but I honestly can't help. Across the Spider-Verse stretches the boundaries of animation in an industry that's fearful of the its growing dependence on generative AI. But can anyone deny the human essence that's keeping it all together? This is what I'd call a WORK of ART. Apparently, if you're a keen observer, you'll notice six different animation styles used throughout the film (whereas most such films have one).The makers figured out a distinct animation style for each of its central characters and the design/tech teams worked over the years to make it happen. The styles switch between different universes, yet everything looks cohesive. Every shot is so vibrant and wallpaper-like, and the hand-drawn quality of it is something to marvel at (pun intended!). We have way too many Spiderpeople in this film, and that's not a rub on the storytelling in any way. It's infact one of its core strengths. With Phil Lord and Christopher Miller part of the writing team, I did have pretty high hopes on the routes they'd take. The storytelling payoffs with such diverse protagonists are absolutely brilliant, if I were to summarise.The soundtrack choices are fantastic once again, and Daniel Pemberton's score is one of the film's essential ingredients. Shots even include cross-property interactions, which is a total delight when it's done in good taste. And in this case, IT IS! I was getting a bit tired out by almost every big superhero film going the multiverse/parallel dimensions route, but here's one film where that's put to superb effect. The voiceover cast also does a tremendous job. Above all of it, the animation work is goading the entire industry to push further and further. That's a wholesome achievement in itself. I can't wait to see the third instalment rake in a lot of money at the box office and receive unanimous critical appreciation.",NA
"hulsserge","31 May 2023","If there is one downside to it, it is that you must rewatch it to see everything.And with that out of the way, just go and enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.
