"ThomDerd","22 October 2018","Venom is about the symbiotic relationship of man and alien, with the latter being the gross one. Funny at times, with a lovely performance from Tom Hardy -if you are a fan of mr Hardy, this is going to be entertaining for you.
First half goes very well in terms of setting the story and the venom universe, second part is more about action and there it has a few flaws but it is still fun and interesting to watch.
It is a cool view on the ""almost anti-hero"" venom/eddie character that kept my attention.
I had a good time watching this in the theaters and i ll definitely have a second view when it comes out in bray or dvd.
So, all in all its def not the best action film of all times or even of 2018...but dont have too high expectations and you will definitely like it.
8/10.","

"Ch4ndler_B1ng","12 June 2020","This movie is kind of a mixed bag. There are certain elements of it that I think are creative, but by far it is definitely one of the lesser Marvel films. The only thing I disagree with Martin Scorsese about is that ""Marvel movies are like theme park rides"" because there are ones like Endgame, Thor Ragnarok (my personal favourite Marvel movie), Civil War, The Avengers, Infinity War and many others that have a far deeper meaning and much more than just entertainment. Overall, Venom is one of those okay movies that doesn't deserve hate, the scenes where the Venom inside Tom Hardy's character is talking to him are pretty hilarious.73%","

"claudio_carvalho","2 December 2018","""Venom"" is a funny and entertaining film based on a Marvel antihero Venom with reasonable storyline, awesome special effects and weak and annoying villain performed by the awful Riz Ahmed. However, Tom Hardy has good performance in the role of the clumsy loser Eddie Brock and Michelle Williams complete the lead cast. This film is also the chance to see Stan Lee in his last cameo. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Venom""","

The effects are so good, Venom is a terrific creation, I loved the monologues, so good.I will visit the cinema for the second, this was great. 8/10.","

"TheLittleSongbird","17 October 2018","Do have a fondness for superhero films. 'Venom' also had talented people in the cast, Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams have both done great work in their careers, it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting anti-heroes in the superhero universe.Watched 'Venom' with reasonably high expectations and with the willingness, as always, to judge the film for myself and form my own opinion. Was aware that it was not well liked by the critics, but part of me was really hoping to disagree with the thought that could a film with so much potential be worse than it actually looked? Have to agree with those that were left disappointed, while also not finding 'Venom' to be that bad. Am not though going to join in the irritatingly excessive critic bashing from people who really need to start learning the difference between fact and opinion.'Venom' does have good things. It is at its best in the scenes and chemistry between Eddie and Venom, which had fun and tension. It is when Venom arrives on screen too when the film properly starts to generate interest, after too long struggling to invest in the first act. The darker elements of the film are actually quite well done, having a dark grit and creepiness. It looks reasonably good, well designed and shot with slickness and atmosphere.The music has pleasant moments and fits well while there is some exciting action, especially the car chase sequence. Some of the effects are terrific. Tom Hardy is intensely charismatic, with Eddie/Venom being interesting and well contrasted characters, far more believable than Topher Grace in 'Spiderman 3'.However, the rest of the cast don't fare so greatly. Michelle Williams has never had a flatter character than here and is basically wasted in a development-free plot-device role. Riz Ahmed is far too anaemic for the one-dimensional villain that's both cartoonish and insipid. Of the characters, only Eddie and Venom engage and intrigue, the rest are flat. While some of the effects are terrific, others are terrible especially in the latter stages with the biggest offender being the rushed and clumsy climax.It is the script and story where 'Venom' fails most. The script is really clunky, especially with the forced and goofy humour that can be misplaced (Venom's disgust at taking the elevator was the one moment passing as funny) and the villain spouting dialogues and speeches that mean nothing. The less too about the soapy and cliché-ridden scenes featuring Hardy and Williams the better, they are bland and don't serve much point, and the Life Institute scenes should have had more clarity. Unfortunately, these scenes dominate the first act and makes it feel rather dull and ""taking too long to get going"". The story is tonally disjointed, too many tones that are very variable on their own and don't gel together, and very clunky. This is not a case of the film not trying, to me it came over as trying too hard in catering to everyone and throwing in too many ideas and elements and executing them very variably and too safely. For a story intended to be dark and violent, this seemed rather tame and held back.Summing up, a disappointment but not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox","

"kosmasp","2 May 2019","I get it, even the people who may already hit the not helpful button, before reading this. You see my rating and go: ""no way"". And I get it in the sense, that I haven't read the comics as much as many people who were expecting and hoping this would go ""R""-rated. Of course this stretches the boundaries of PG-13, because it is quite violent. But it will never be enough from what I heard from people who know the comics.So if that is something that is dear to your heart, again I get it. If you are just here to enjoy a comic book movie, there is quite a lot to enjoy. Tom Hardy really cherishes in his mania. Enjoy the Mayhem even if there was a sort of better ""inside voice"" movie last year called ""Upgrade"". So yes, if you only watch one of those make it Upgrade. But if you don't mind watching another, watch this too, because it ain't half bad","

"declan-98915","3 October 2018","First of all Iv just watched the movie a couple of hours ago and Iv just been reading a few reviews and I must have been watching a different movie to them cause I absolulty loved Venom!I love the relationship between Eddie and Venom, they proper cracked me up with some of the things they said and the whole room was laughing at loads of moments throughout the movie. Coming out of this movie makes me want to have a symbiote latch onto me if it's anything like the film. I loved the movie from end to finish, it was a hilarious, fun filled action ride!My only critic is I would have liked the finale to go on for a little longer but other than that I thought it was brilliant, I deffo reccomend everyone go see it.DONT Listen to other people's reviews, go watch it for yourself then decide if u liked it or not, I loved it!","

"SnoopyStyle","27 December 2018","In San Francisco, struggling reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is ordered to do a puff piece on bio-tech mogul Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of Life Foundation. Drake's spacecraft crashed after retrieving symbiotic lifeforms from a comet. Brock gets fired for asking tough questions to Drake and his fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) leaves him. Drake starts experimenting on people. Scientist Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) turns whistle-blower and sneaks Brock into the research facility. There, Brock is exposed to the symbiote Venom.I had reservations about a Venom movie without Spider-Man. I can safely say that this is vastly superior to Spider-Man 3. The interesting aspect is the relationship between Brock and Venom. They really become actual people and I can feel for them. Venom tells Brock that they're both losers. It's a surprising character reveal and one with good potential for future movies. It's a great way to do this version of Venom given the limitations of the rights issue. At first, I was concerned about Hardy but he turns in a compelling performance. I do have an issue Michelle Williams' hair. I can't tell if they deliberately gave her a bad cut or a bad wig. It does work to downgrade her from Hollywood stardom. It does set up Venom to have an ongoing franchise which is its major hurdle.","

"krazy-mm","3 October 2018","Had a test screening tonight in cinema I work at, and couldn't wait to watch my all-time favorite Marvel (anti) hero on big screen.
Tom Hardy is great as always, that guy really can act. Can't think of anyone else who would be a better choice for the role but him.
Introduction was really long, but I was not bored for a second. When Venom comes in his true form - the party starts! Wish few action scenes were less like Michael Bay's style (hardly see anything) but the inner child in me was really happy for Venom's maniacal kicking and punching around. Venom's character is really well made visually - his walking, jumping and smashing are just like in the comic books - thumbs up for that!Hope they will release R rated version on BluRay so we can see more of Venom's craziness. Tom Hardy allegedly said best parts are cut out to make the movie more age appropriate, and I think that's a shame. Anyway, I will watch this movie once more in cinema, and buy it on BluRay. After all, it's Venom!Go and see it on big screen - hope you won't be disappointed!Oh, and there are TWO mid-credit scenes - one we all are waiting for and another one that...just go and see it for yourself!","

"akdjreview","21 December 2021","Venom is a nice enjoyable superhero film which I was quite interested in. The film has a very Marvel story, it's not the first time I've seen a story like this one but with just different characters and different settings. Though the story of not knowing whether Venom is good or evil is an interesting aspect not really seen before.But I still found it quite enjoyable. There is no fantastic cinematography techniques or anything like that. But Venom played by Tom Hardy manages to deliver an amazing acting performance in comparison to other Marvel movies.I recommend Venom for superhero film fans to watch it's an interesting story with a little bit of a twist.","

"Top_Dawg_Critic","29 November 2018","You would think one of the 5 (why?) writers could have gotten this right. Tom Hardy was amazing, the directing excellent, cinematography on point, V/SFX not bad, but the story was very loose and had plot and pacing issues. Venom's voice was also annoying. You would think the producers would have hired better writers instead of pathetically paying for almost every review on here 9 and above being fake (pretty much only film reviewed). I may have given this film a 7 or 8 out of 10, but only gets a 6 for the fake reviews. For me it could have been much better and deserving of the 9's and 10's had the writing been tighter. Nevertheless, still enjoyable, but sadly only a 6/10 from me, mainly for the fake reviews that piss me off.","

"Anurag-Shetty","5 October 2018","Venom tells the story of news reporter, Eddie Brock(Tom Hardy). When a symbiote bonds with Eddie, he transforms into the deadly symbiote known as, Venom. Eddie will have to channel the powers of the symbiote, to save his life. Venom is an awesome film. Director Ruben Fleischer has done complete justice to the character of Venom after his disappointing portrayal in Spider-Man 3(2007). Still, we definitely miss that connection to Spider-Man because, Venom & Spider-Man are always connected in the comics. The action set pieces are fantastic. The critics can't whine about CGI fight scenes because, what more can you expect from a CGI character. Still, I wish they would have shown us some of the more nasty things that Venom did in the movie. An R rating would have helped but, I can understand why they decided to make the movie PG-13. They needed to make way for Spider-Man in possible sequels(fingers crossed). Tom Hardy is the star of the show as Eddie Brock/Venom. Hardy perfects the relationship between Eddie & Venom. Eddie being the vulnerable host & Venom being the caged animal that can be let loose at any time. There are a number of hysterical set pieces involving interactions between Eddie & Venom. Tom Hardy also perfects Venom's classic deep & gruff voice. Michelle Williams is brilliant as Anne Weying. It's nice to see Williams star in a comic book movie. Riz Ahmed is spectacular as Carlton Drake/Riot. Scott Haze is impressive as Security Chief Roland Treece. Reid Scott is great as Dr. Dan Lewis. Jenny Slate is amazing as Dr. Dora Skirth. The supporting cast is impressive. Venom is a must watch for Venom & Tom Hardy fans. Ignore the critics & go for it with moderate expectations.","

"Watcher42","25 November 2018","What an incredibly average film.It takes no risks. It's watered down. It's generic. It's trying to give the impression it's following Deadpool down the R-Rated super hero route, but it didn't have the guts to go the whole way, or even take a step really.Tom Hardy is an OK Eddie Brock, but I still find him a bit hit and miss as an actor, and that comes through even from scene to scene here. Sometimes he just mumbles his way through with no effort and I genuinely wondered if he was channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, while other times he actually seemed to be trying, especially with the physical aspects. There's no connection or chemistry between Tom and Michelle Williams. I guess she was just hoping for some Marvel money and didn't realise this was a Sony picture. And the rest of the cast are incredibly average and forgettable. Especially Jenny Slate, who will always be stuck as Mona-Lisa from Parks & Rec.There's years of comic book lore and stories to draw on for Venom, but they ignore much of it... For example, why does Venom look like Spider-man? We know why from the comics, but in the movie it makes no mention of this, so we're left with questions and a very one dimensional character as a result.Of all the stories that could have been told about a symbiotic alien, and all the interesting directions they could have taken the story, they decide to go with what boils down to a boring buddy movie.","

"TheMovieDoctorful","5 October 2018","Wow...Something different...Something ACTUALLY different. No, Venom is no masterpiece. It's not perfect. It's not quite as great as I hoped it would be, but...It's ACTUALLY something different. And in an age where Marvel and DC give us the same comic book movie 500 times a year, that's incredibly high praise. Let me clarify; despite what you've been told, Venom is not a superhero movie. Venom is, at its heart, a horror comedy monster flick. It has much more in common in its characters, story, tone, comedy and action sequences with An American Werewolf in London or Evil Dead than, say, The Avengers or The Dark Knight. That's a wildly inventive and different take on the genre and enough to give it some much needed, genuine diversity.As I said, the film definitely has its problems. Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake is a terrible villain, one of the worst in recent comic book movie history. I'd like to say that he's better than most of the easily disposable MCU villains, but even compared to them, he's still low tier. Drake is your typical ""evil corporate bad guy"", but Ahmed is neither charismatic, over-the-top or intimidating enough to make it really work. The real shame is that the movie easily could have made him work as a perfect adversary for Hardy's Brock; a legally invulnerable, corrupt millionaire going up against an unlucky, lower class reporter with a chip on his shoulder. However, this dynamic is never really explored as much as it should be and, by the end of the day, his arc just ends in yet another case of 2 black CGI monsters smashing into each other.The neutered PG-13 rating also hurts the film significantly. To its credit, the film is surprisingly violent (To the point where my theater occasionally gasped) and there are moments of genuine suspense and terror here. However, at the end of the day, this is still the kind of movie where someone can get sliced in half with a blade arm and not leave a drop of blood. The edits are clear and blatant and I couldn't help but occasionally cringe at the obvious censor job Sony did to get the film at a more marketable PG-13. Here's hoping for an R-rated Director's Cut.I must say, Tom Hardy is perfect, as both Eddie Brock and Venom. As Eddie Brock, he's likable, goofy, charmingly dorky and incredibly sympathetic. As Venom, he's darkly hilarious, witty and commands an incredible screen presence. And his chemistry with Michelle Williams' Anne Weying (As both Venom and Eddie Brock) is off the charts. As somebody who frequently finds love stories in comic book films to be tepid and half hearted, this may be my favorite romance in a comic book film. It has its frequent adorable and sweet moments, but it isn't afraid to cover the more painful and stressful parts of their relationship either. It felt way more genuine to me than any other love story I've seen in a superhero movie. There's a scene in the 3rd act of the film involving Eddie, Michelle and the symbiote that is simultaneously sweepingly romantic, absolutely hilarious and incredibly bizarre. Without spoiling it, all I can say is that whether you love it or hate it, you won't forget that moment any time soon.Michelle Williams is fantastic in her own right too. She does an excellent job portraying Weying's spunk, confidence and intelligence and Williams brings both charisma and emotional vulnerability to the role. Weying herself is a surprisingly strong character as well; she's arguably even more proactive than Eddie is and I loved watching her arc from distant and condescending to more empathetic and compassionate. I've missed the days when love interests in comic book movies had genuine character arcs, so Williams' Weying was another breath of fresh air in a comic book movie already full of them.The comedy is definitely the highlight. This is by far the funniest comic book film I've seen to date, it puts both Deadpool movies to shame. It's very reminiscent of a John Landis or Sam Raimi horror comedy from the 80s. Complete insanity in the best way. There's a particular scene in a restaurant that had me laughing so hard my lungs hurt.As for the story, again, it's not particularly deep, but its clever in its own way, and has its admitted emotional moments regarding Anne and Eddie's relationship. The film works as a very interesting anti-Spider-Man movie; Eddie's irresponsibility is as essential to the character as Peter's responsibility and the movie tells a very compelling journey of a deeply self absorbed man having to learn to finally put the people around him above his own self interests when the chips are down. Even Eddie's relationship with his suit serves as a dark mirror to Spider-Man; in Homecoming, Peter has to learn that he doesn't need the suit to be a hero. In Venom, Eddie needs the friendship of his own suit to save the day.Venom is not the best comic book movie ever. It's not quite as great as I had hoped. But it's the farthest thing from bad. It has more heart and brains than critics are giving it credit for and it's a desperately needed original take on a genre that's admittedly been suffering from repetition, exhaustion and over-saturation. It's definitely more interesting, bold and rewatchable than 80% of the easily disposable and forgettable MCU films. It'll probably be more interesting, bold and rewatchable than any of the DCEU films post-Justice League (Including Justice League), which may as well be MCU-lite. I think I'm gonna go watch it again.(Also, very minor point, but that Eminem song was awful. It felt like a Vanilla Ice or MC Hammer song, only unironic and played completely straight. It was actually lowkey embarrassing to listen to.)","

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","5 October 2018","I knew it. The film was not even half as bad as the critics said. VENOM is the electrifying action movie you need to see in theaters. I saw it today in 4DX 3D and found it highly entertaining. There are a lot of white knuckle action scenes enhanced further by a solid CGI work. An exhilarating vehicular chase sequence had me excited to the core and so did all the other action sequences. Tom Hardy's performance is impressive. His interactions with Venom are heart winning. VENOM is ultimately fast paced. I didn't realize when time flew by. This film has made me like Venom a lot. I liked him in SPIDER-MAN 3 also (which was a great movie in my opinion) but he wasn't portrayed as a hero in that one. In this one, Venom will definitely not be hated. There is also a good amount of comedy and horror present in the film although primarily this is an action movie with a science fiction setting.VENOM definitely reminded me of the dark atmosphere built by Sam Raimi in his Spider-Man movies. That's another reason why I wanted to watch it. It's a highly entertaining action entertainer which needs to be seen and enjoyed as a whole. Since this is anyways an origin story, don't expect it to be overstuffed. Just book your tickets, grab some eatables, bring along a friend or be alone, and watch this film on the biggest screen possible, in 3D. Plus, there are some interesting surprises towards the end, so feel free to stay instead of just walking away. P.S. - I have not read any Venom comics till date.","

"tresm87","7 October 2018","While it may break away from the comics slightly by not including the Spiderman origin story, the true characterization integrity within Eddie Brock/Venom is vibrant and extremely close to source material. The story alteration might even improve the overall direction of this new standalone Venom series because now we can truly focus on Brock/venom and not have Parker/Spiderman constantly take away from his attention. I believe we've had enough of Spiderman, and honestly after the travesty that was Homecoming imho, I'm fine with that for now. Venom starts off with a bang and we get some nice new aspects to how the symbiotes came to be in this earth as well as some great character development of Eddie Brock's life before Venom. Let me just say that Tom Hardy Makes this entire film work with a completely passionately versatile performance showing immense acting talent like he always does. Once Eddie Brock achieves full symbiosis, it becomes an absolutely intense and fun experience to witness, and it really brought me back to the old comics. I've been a fan of venom for nearly 30 years and I can honestly say they nailed the relationship between Brock and venom, and it's damn right awesome to see it on the big screen. The action never lets up after that and there were some insanely well done sequences full of amazing visuals. I honestly thought the CGI use for venom looked spectacular, and about as good as you could have it. The unexpected X factor of this film was it's hilariously twisted dialogue between Brock and venom, and honestly at times it was almost charming in a way. While there were a few bits that were absolutely ridiculous, I was able to overlook those few and far between moments. I thought Riz Ahmed what is a serviceable enough Carlton drake/riot, and played the conniving billionaire villain decently. I do think the plot was a bit rushed towards the end, but the finale was very exciting regardless. The post credit scene leaves you with an incredible sense of anticipation for the next venom installment as it introduces one of the most violent and brutal characters in all of comics. I did however think he was going to be in this film a lot more and was slightly disappointed ,but when I know what the future holds, I can forget about that slight nitpick. Another huge aspect of this film that breaks away from the safe MCU formula, is its sheer visceral brutality minus any blood really. They actually did a great job on a PG-13 rating making it still a very dark and violent film with some outstanding body horror sequences. I do really hope that they will go for an R rating for the sequel once carnage starts wreaking pure havoc. They would benefit so much from making it R rated. Overall an excellent origin tale,and a surprisingly funny film that deserves a ton of credit for going against the grain and breaking out of MCU formulas to start its own Venom universe. This is not part of the MCU and it's better off for it. I cannot wait for the next film to see Harrelson bring the CARNAGE!","

"kevinxirau","12 October 2018","Being that it's October, the month of monsters, there couldn't have been a more appropriate superhero to come out than Venom. Easily one of the most popular Spider-man characters, he made his big screen debut in 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"", which not only failed to impress audiences, but proved to be a great disservice to Venom. Luckily, Sony makes up for this grave mistake with this new film. Plot: Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a journalist digging into the dirty secrets of the shady corporation, the Life Foundation, where he becomes an unwilling host to an alien Symbiote brought to Earth by a rocket ship. As the unlikely pair of man and ravenous parasite endeavors to find a compromise, they must become one as Venom to both survive and prevent more symbiotes from making Earth their new home. Right off the bat, they got Venom right; the internal struggle, the design, and the twisted sense of humor. Hardy gives a well-acted performance as both Eddie and the Symbiote, the two halves bouncing back and forth in a terrific fashion. They alone sell this flick. The supporting cast holds up too with Michelle Williams as Anne Weying doing a good job playing the love interest with a believable relationship. The nods to previous media are also welcome with the mid-credit scene making me geek out. One word best describes the action: savage. The movie works around its PG-13 rating with some satisfyingly kickass fight scenes that get away with nasty-looking deaths (would've preferred rated R, but it works nonetheless). ""Venom"" starts a little slow, getting you into the cast and story organically, but once the titular anti-hero comes out to play, things become seriously fun. An issue that didn't really ruin it for me was that the climax has Venom battling a similarly colored villain (Riot) in a night setting, which made it tricky to see what was going on at times (a differently colored nemesis would've fixed this). The music fits the film as well, having a cool edgy, pseudo-horror vibe to it. All in all, ""Venom"" is a killer good time. Future films are already planned, so I look forward to seeing the toothy alien freak in action once more.","

"ThomasDrufke","17 October 2018","So here's the thing, there isn't a single part of this movie that I liked. I can see where some people found it to be stupid entertainment and silly fun, but that's not exactly the way I like movies. There are always exceptions, but with a cast like Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Woody Harrelson (sort of), I expect a lot more. The script for this film is by far one of the worst things put to film over the last few years. I flat out laughed out loud at how bad some of these lines were. And by no means did I think most of this humor was intentional. If you watch any of the trailers for the film, they are pitching a serious & dark take on the Venom character, so don't give me the whole ""it's supposed to bad"" take. That's just not true. You can forget ever seeing Spider-Man show up in these movies, at least if Sony/Marvel wants me to take him seriously at all. There's no sense in going through and ripping apart each and every part of this film, just know that I disliked the entire thing. Nope, I take that back, I hated it.1.7/10","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","3 October 2018","'Venom (2018)' is usually just fine, but it never comes close to being properly engaging or even all that entertaining. It just constantly skirts the line between being pretty decent and just downright boring. This - combined with its overall weak, poorly paced narrative and its general technical choppiness (including noticeably 'jumpy' editing and several scenes that are strangely blurry, to the point that it seems like the focus-puller might've been asleep) - means that the overall experience isn't all that good. The film certainly lands with a whimper rather than a roar. It actually takes ages for Brock to become the eponymous big boy and, when he does, the dynamic between him and his newfound companion never comes close to being fully formed or even consistent. This means that we can't really relate to - or care for - either of them and that their motivations don't really make all that much sense. Their relationship is supposed to be the driving force of the story, yet it doesn't naturally evolve and never comes close to being compelling. To make matters worse, the whole thing culminates in an awful, CG mess of a finale that's literally difficult to watch, much less comprehend. It inexplicably goes back on several core conceits simply to have our symbiotic lead emerge as a more 'traditional' hero, despite the piece being billed as a decidedly 'villainous' affair. The feature is pretty tame in general, to be honest. It all just comes across as more of poor man's 'Upgrade (2018)' than anything else. Don't even get me started on the absolute joke of an end-credits scene. 4/10.","

Special effects were quite awesome, some of the fight scenes (chasing sequence and climax fight scenes) were amazing. The interaction between Eddie and Venom were quite funny at times.I also felt the movie was too short, having less than 2 hours duration which include the long end credit scenes. Btw, it has 1 mid end credit scene which I think could only be appreciated by the fans of the comic books and 1 post end credit scene. So be sure not too leave your seats too soon.The sound effects with Dolby Atmos was awesome and it is also specialized for IMAX theaters. Overall it was quite fun and entertaining movie. Oh and this movie is in Spider-man own universe but NOT Marvel Cinematic Universe, so you need to manage your expectations.For my complete review, please have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id","

"ufarese","3 October 2018","We just came out of the theatre and I can honestly say. I liked it! It was funny and it paid great homage to the Todd McFarlane bombastic Venom era of the late 90's. It truly baffles me that Sony would not take enough risks to release the film with an R rating. I wonder how much of this film was left on the cutting floor!?! Tom Hardy's performance is also on point and...just go see it.","

"hilary_mae-912-80561","19 October 2018","The movie is a lot of fun. Full of character and a quirky sense of adventure that all the so called ""superhero"" movies are missing. It's funny, lively and engaging all the way through. Great ending! Superhero movies have become so incredibly boring and this is a great change. Tom Hardly is excellent, as are all the cast really, the special effects are amazing. I was disappointed when the movie ended, because I was really enjoying the banter between Eddie and Venom.I suspect that the negative critics are people who just don't know how to let their hair down and have fun.","

But will all the lethal powers manage to stand protector against other weaponized evil rivals. VENOM is a fantastic mess that will capture you and leave you black and blue.","

"pinkled5","5 October 2018","I'm a self-proclaimed movie snob so, based on the reviews I'd read, I fully expected to be disappointed by this film. But my son really wanted to see it, so we went and, wow, I ended up really enjoying it!Yes, there is some awkward dialogue and the villain is underwhelming, however, I liked the other elements so much that those issues really didn't bother me.First off, Eddie Brock is super likable and relatable. Tom Hardy, who I've never been a fan of, knocked it out of the park with his performance of this character. I really felt for Eddie and was drawn into his plight. Though some have complained the beginning of the movie is too slow, Eddie Brock kept my interest the whole time.Secondly, everything about Venom is super cool. The struggle between Eddie and Venom and their argumentative banter made for both some delightful conflict and laugh-out-loud comedy. Yes, there were a few lines that were duds and made me roll my eyes, but overall I thought it was fantastic.Finally, the mix of action, horror, and comedy was done almost perfectly, in my opinion. This was a concern of mine, based on the reviews, but the flim makers pulled it off well.All in all, we left the theater excited and thrilled and can't wait to see Venom on the big screen again. Kudos to Sony and BOOOO to the critics!","

"quincytheodore","3 October 2018","Spider-Man has been a personal favorite super hero of mine. Despite the debacle with different studios and without having Spider-Man, I personally rooted Venom to succeed. However, the jarring tonal shift, occasional clumsy dialogues and heavy reliance on CGI are eerie reminisces of less sophisticated super hero movie from early 2000. It's disappointing because there are some good set pieces here and Tom Hardy tries his damn hardest.On a quick glance Venom can be an action thriller, the tone fits perfectly almost in Daredevil crime drama fashion. It almost reaches such darker place but doesn't dare to take the final step, instead it instantly switches to humor. While this new more cynical Venom is not entirely bad, he is such a good character to establish a more intense atmosphere. It does hurt the nuance, toning down on the menacing aura.Whatever element works on Venom can be credited to Tom Hardy. He displays the reluctant anti-hero so dysfunctionally well. His gesture, slight twitch and banter with the alien invader are a blast. Pacing and script can be problematic, but Tom Hardy just goes all in with sheer tenacity. When it goes to Venom, CGI is inevitable. It's rather unconvincing at times and a more physical choreography would do more wonder than the black suit. I want to see this as standalone movie, but in the end Venom does need Spider-Man. He could've been a stronger faster version of Spidey and with Tom Hardy as anti hero, that would've made such an interesting clash. Also, if it wants to go for sci-fi thriller route, there's already a recent movie with same premise, Upgrade, which sadly did everything better.It's not devoid of entertainment, sometimes the humor hits sweet spot, but if you're here for the sentiment of the Venom namesake, this is not the Homecoming you want. It might not be even the Andrew Garfield kind.","

"thisseatofmars","5 October 2018","""Venom"" is the best superhero movie I've seen in a long time, partly because it turns the superhero formula on its head. While good, I find The Dark Knight movies usually too intense and serious, while most Marvel movies are too tongue-in-cheek (like constant little jokes Marvel movies inject to mollify a scene's tension). It's interesting then that this film, about a character who looks like a demon from Hell, manages to strike that perfect balance between being dark, intense, and light humour. And make no mistake, Venom is a real monster. He eats the brains of his foes and his voice could make the Predator wet himself. But it's not all dark and intense: Venom is *likeable.* He doesn't make quips; he's earnest. If Venom isn't telling the hero to eat the brains of villains he is egging the hero on to get back with his ex-girlfriend. That is *genius,* and this interest that Venom has in people leads to some fantastic moments in the movie. There's a scene where Venom convinces the hero to apologize to the ex, and the hero does so, ending resentment between the two. When this happens Venom says, completely unironically, ""Aw. That's nice."" I love Venom, the character, and watching him interact with the people around him is just as entertaining as the insane fight scenes where he is decimating whole teams of armoured, armed men. Venom is charismatic and fascinating; I'd love to see more of him interacting with Eddie Brock (the film's protagonist character) and seeing the conversations they'd have. I have to commend the filmmakers on Venom's design: he is huge and brutal and he animates beautifully, from the saliva dripping from his lizard tongue to his creepy, bulbous eyes. Venom should always have that insane, rictus grin on his face; I never like seeing Venom in the comics without it. Having Venom wearing the grin throughout the movie was definitely the right way to go. Tom Hardy is a great actor and his talent delivers the human element of the movie. He's played Bane in Batman and Max in Mad Max; he demonstrates range by playing humorous scenes and the fish out of water character of Eddie Brock, who is utterly bewildered by becoming the host to Venom. Michelle Williams is great as Brock's ex; she is spunky and tough and Hardy and Williams work well together. But Venom steals the show. Brock and Venom have more chemistry than Brock and the love interest. The opening of the film is somewhat slow, but they have a lot to set up. The post-credits scene features Brock meeting Cletus Cassidy, and Woody Harrelson is the most perfect choice to play the role, but the wig they gave Harrelson was ridiculous. But apart from that, I loved ""Venom,"" and I can't wait to see more. Hopefully it won't be too long before we get a sequel.","

The story is compelling, helped by his incredible performance, moreover, combining it with humour, brings that extra touch. One thing's for sure, you don't want to find yourself on Venom's list. All in all, this movie guarantees a good time at the cinema.","

"abisio","6 October 2018","Yes; it is a MARVEL character but the movie was made by SONY which guarantees better action no so intricate (and boring ) script and more adult fare than almost childish scripts in the recent Avengers (forgive me Guardian of the Galaxy).VENOM story is quite simple; looser lost everything, gets possessed by an Alien Parasite and saves the world. Between the lines; the movie leaves a space open for your choice of dark, darker or darkest. VENOM itself eats people alive and on top of that is pretty much killing the host (an outstanding Tom Hardy) so it is not really a very nice guy.The action scenes are original, tense and entertaining; something MARVEL / DISNEY could care less as seen in their last movies. There are lots of humor; sometimes towards to adults and language is strong (even a couple of F** out there).The only two minor problems; it takes perhaps a few minutes to more than necessary to turn on full motion and the script could have been a little more.In brief; pure satisfying and guilty entertainment","

Not many of these type of movies appealed to me... but Venom pulled it off and it added to the humour.Could it have been darker? Yes of course...... but this is Hollywood for you!!

"AdrenalinDragon","3 October 2018","Believe it or not, I had hopes that Venom might have been good. Not great, just good. Those expectations fell not too far into the movie, before Venom even showed up. The jokes were falling flat, everyone was getting frustrated with Eddie (Tom Hardy) being quite irritating, and nothing much entertaining was happening on-screen. We were all waiting for Venom to actually appear.It wasn't all doom and gloom though. Once Venom finally shows up, it gets a bit better. For example, when Eddie and Venom are actually bantering and telling each other off, it can be entertaining in parts and showed some potential with Venom's character. Definitely the closest anyone got to laughing in my fully packed cinema. That's another problem with the movie, though. It's quite hard to tell what's supposed to be funny and what isn't sometimes. It really is all over the place. I don't know who thought toning it down to PG-13 violence was a great idea. It was disappointing they cut so much content out of the movie.Most of the performances were average. The CGI was not that great. Felt a bit dated and Venom didn't look that convincing for the most part. The soundtrack was passable, I suppose. Nothing really memorable. Most of the movie was mediocre/passable. As I said before, the highlights are when both Eddie and Venom are the focus together, but when it turns to the other characters it becomes a bit dull again. The action sequences range from mediocre to passable, but nothing really stands out as memorable and stuff you haven't already seen loads of times before in superhero movies. You can predict most of the plot and the twist and turns from a mile away. The villain was generic and not all that exciting. I'd suggest sitting through the post-credits sequence though. Overall I don't feel Venom was completely unwatchable, but could have been alot better. Adding Spider-Man to the mix would have probably elevated it quite a bit alone. Overall the negatives/blandness of Venom prevent it from being a good movie. I'm still unsure if I'd like to see a sequel to it in the near future.5/10","

"Platypuschow","6 December 2018","When I heard about a Venom movie, I was excited.
When I heard Hardy was to play Brock, I was concerned.
When I saw the trailer, I lost all interest.But truth be told, it wasn't as bad as feared but it certainly isn't everything it should have been.With a heavily modified version of Venoms origin story this R rated movie separate from the Marvel Universe is a watchable but ultimately uninspired affair.When I first heard about the film it was said to not only be R-Rated but delving into the realms of horror. Truth be told the end product is not horror, it's comedy. The idea of Venom being a comedy is insane, yet is the only reason I rated the film as highly as I have.It's actually quite funny and instead of the badass in the comics Eddie Brock is a loveable loser type that Hardy played considerably well.A major cgi-fest this 100 million costing Hollywood effort is saved by the humour it simply shouldn't have even had.The story is generic, it really has nothing very original to offer but a fair few laughs make it more watchable than by all rights it should have been.Venom is better than I expected.
Hardy is better than I expected.
But it's certainly not the Venom movie we wanted nor deserve.The Good:Some great action sequencesQuite funny, oddlyThe Bad:Tom HardyAnother ""Tweaked"" origin storySome of the sfx are actually quite badThings I Learnt From This Movie:I don't remember Eddie Brock being a comedy characterTom Hardy isn't entirely uselessJenny Slate > Michelle Williams","

"ayoreinf","8 October 2018","Once again I break my own rule of not writing review for films with over 500 reviews (that is, over 500 when I write my review). I liked this movie because it dares doing a few unthinkable things for a Hollywood action film. It dares showing, in a manner of speaking some collateral damage. I mean - in so many Hollywood action films bullets are flying all over the place in the busiest streets without a single bystander getting a scratch. In this movie they do get hurt, most of the time we see it off screen, but we see it, the movie acknowledge the fact the innocent lives are lost. For a comics based movie, thats as close to realism as they can (and should) get. 
 Another place where the movie is possitively daring, is in daring to show Venum as the character he was created on the comics, a savage predator, with very little noble emotions or caring thought for anyone other than its own self preservation. The movie does veer off the original comic book story of origin, but it keeps the comics book nature of the beast, and that's a big plus in my personal book.Other aspects of movie making: let's not speak about CGI anymore, I think it's a mere technical issue, and there'll always be those who say the CGI was lame. It wasn't but it's not a surprise, it's the way it is. The actors are very good, and I liked the fact Tom Hardy gets to play a comic character with his own face. I hated his mask when he was Bane. It was part of the character, but it killed half the potential of real acting in that film. Here he gets to really act, and he's great. Michelle Williams is as charming as ever, and perfect for the role, and Riz Ahmed is a very good villain. Jenny Slate should get more screen time, she's a great sctress, who doesn't get half the credit she deserves.Altogether, a great, slightly different sort of comic movie, if it wasn't a bit rushed with the convertion of Venum, I'd rate it even higher.","

"ellimic","20 October 2018","I saw Venom at the cinema today and thought it was a brilliant film; it had a good plot that turned a disliked Marvel villain into almost an anti-hero, and there were some good funny moments.The idea that Riot and Venom were only two of the four 'samples' returned to Earth, and that Riot revealed there were hundreds more like them on his world, hinted at the numerous Symbiotes in the Marvel comic books.It was a good twist to the story that Anne Weying allowed Venom to bond with her when Venom is separated from Eddie, transforming her into She-Venom, another Marvel comic book character.I hope theres a sequel in the future, which they did hint at with the appearance of Cletus Kasady (who in the Marvel Comic books is host to the Symbiote Carnage).I enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe but knew this was not considered part of that big collaboration (which was confirmed in the opening credits which had Marvels usual logo, not the new logo used in the latest MCU films with scenes from the previous films)
That said I think it would be worthy of the MCU, and being based in San Francisco when the MCU is primarily in New York it would not affect the MCU's storyline, but it could be a good future opponent for Spider-Man.There was a rumour before the films release of an appearance by Tom Holland (the MCU's Spider-Man) but after his 'destruction' at the end of Avengers Infinity War this would have just been too confusing so I'm glad it never happened.","

Everything thing else just falls into place, even the ending which is where a lot of origin stories fall over on was great!
Loved it, I loved Spider-Man, all of them, this is different, funny different, but that's how it should be... it's a man hearing a voice in his head with super powers, What'a not funny about that! 😁👍

"Prismark10","1 December 2018","Venom was a mess. Not helped that the Marvel character has to be painted as an anti-hero of a sorts and not a villain.Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a committed investigative reporter in San Francisco. He has a nice apartment, an ace lawyer girlfriend (Michelle Williams.)Eddie loses it all when he has to interview an Elon Musk type businessman Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) whose spacecraft crashed. Eddie asks uncomfortable questions regarding his pharmaceutical business and gets fired.Drake has found an organism from space. Drake is conducting unethical experiments with homeless people. The organism achieves symbiosis with Eddie when he breaks into the laboratory and this gives him extraordinary powers and a desire to eat human heads.Eddie and Venom combine, but Eddie is slowly being killed by the symbiote and Venom wants to destroy the planet. Venom has a change of heart and then another more powerful symbiote is unleashed.The film is slow to get going. Hardy looks miscast but gamely tries hard with what he has. Riz is saddled as a onenote villain. Williams is just the bland girlfriend.The film fits uneasily in the Spiderman universe as it is presented as a darker film but totally it is all over the place. With so many script writers, I think this film shows all the signs of post production executive interference.","

"generationofswine","22 December 2018","It's getting 10 stars because I have a simple policy that, if the movie entertains, it did it's job.That being said...it's jarring watching it as a comic book fan. You're constantly fighting the urge to look at the TV and yell ""That's not how it happened!""I don't think Eddie was as much of a scumbag as he should have been...but Hardy was far better than Grace. And they symbiote wasn't exactly as fun as it was in the comics...but then you only really heard one side of the conversation in the comics.For an origin story, it was fun...but with Venom being one of the best known Spidey characters, and with Spidey being one of the best known comic book characters...was an origin story necessary? Especially one that was going to change so much of the character?It could have easily started off after the origin and rolled along on its way as to not irk the fans of the comics.Despite all of that, it was a well balanced mix of amusing and dark, and those combinations usually tend to work...even if it didn't have the blood that gore that would have sent the film over the top in best possible way.You get your money's worth watching it. And it's not something that you'll regret seeing...that is unless you're one of those people that can't get past butchering the source material.","

What it isn't is fantastic however.-buildup. The intro of the movie was fine. Nothing spectacular but certainly progressed the story into the right direction. Though it did linger on for a tad bit too long.-The plot while amusing, is definitely lacking and drops the ball at least at a certain point, which i cant really dive into here due to spoilers. This certainly is the biggest problem with the movie. -CGI. Not great but certainly far from bad! -Venom. The symbiote is awesome and i loved the bonding with Tom Hardy's character which truly moved the movie forward. Definitely the strongest point within the movie and was eager for more!-Overall. Ignore the damn paid critics. They are a dying breed and shouldve been put out of their misery years ago. This movie is entertaining. While i was dissapointed with the lack of a true dark tone, it wasnt all pure comedy either. it was a decent balance.Check this movie out for yourself and vote accordingly.

"Xamalion","3 October 2018","If you read about the difficult way to this movie (it's been in production hell since Spiderman 3), then you have to accomplish that it turned out quite well. Tom Hardy is a really good choice for the role, and he delivers a solid performance as the underdog on his way to become the hero. I really like that they portray him half of the movie as a coward, because when you look at him he's quite an impressive figure. He's likable. I constantly felt the need of hugging him and telliing him ""it's gonna be alright"" until Venom arrives. I didn't know Michelle Williams was in this movie until I saw her, and she is great. Her brief appearance as female Venom made me cheer and wanting more of that. How cool woul it be if both of them would have a symbiont and team up. Riz Ahmed is a really good actor, because I hated him the first moment he appeared on screen. The movie is a bit of a slow burner because they spend over 30 minutes until the fun kicks in, but then it REALLY kicks in. Venom is funny as hell. In my opinion he's the better Rocket, because Rocket always seems forced funny while Venom is purely instinct driven and the funny part occurs in bizzare ways. In comparison Deadpool is eye blink funny, Venom is absolutely dark funny and that's really great. And there we come to the ..ckheads at Sony for cutting out 40 minutes and forcing a PG13 at it. You're the stupidest people on this planet and I hope you die. Seriously. Venom would agree with me, while biting their heads off. And then there is the other ..ckmove of not putting this in the MCU. As I said, Venom is funny and would be a great addition to the family. Especially knowing that the Avengers will come to an end (at least the team as it is now) after the next Infinity War movie and with the introduction of Captain Marvel. I can't stand the fact, that neither Sony or Disney/Marvel give a damn about the fans. It's always about the effing money and what dumb people in ugly suits think.
I hope they will overthink all this and include the character into the MCU, where it belongs.","

I understand that he may have been persuaded by his son who is a fan of 'Venom'..It just goes to prove that you should never listen to your children.If you enjoy special effects at the expense of good acting and an intelligent plot then this will be right up your street.When I say that the highlight for me was the brief cameo appearance by the late great Stan Lee then you will get my drift.I am always intrigued by the reviews which begin...'do not believe all the negative reviews'..this invariably suggests to me that I really should believe all the negative reviews.Maybe I should start a trend by commencing my review by saying 'do not believe all the positive reviews'..then again I may be accused of contradicting myself. Suffice to say that in my humble opinion this is one turkey of a film. Mind you it is the festive season. ..","

"JohnDeSando","4 October 2018","Venom is a surprise: It's funny; it's mad; and much to my delight, it has an antihero more interesting than a pile of other Marvel superheroes on most days. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is an ace TV street reporter who manages to lose his job pursuing a demented inventor, Dr. Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), while managing to become the host for an ugly but sometimes comical slimy alien parasite or ""symbiote.""Although film Venom is replete with the usual superhero tropes like the slow-to-get-it love interest, Anne (Michelle Williams), the demented scientist, the threat to the world, and toothy monsters, it has a levity Deadpool could admire, but to a much lesser extent. Not a small number of light moments come from the dialogue between Eddie and his occupying alien Venom, who decides he likes Eddie and the planet so he won't be the one to destroy it. There are others like him to do it.As in so many of these horror, sci fi thrillers, the amount of violence from explosions and body tossing is too much. Director Ruben Fleischer could have minimized the scenes and substituted more of the ironic dialogue that makes this a watchable adventure. Scott Rosenberg and the other writers are up to the task.Hardy's winning characterization of a rough-around-the-edges hero who has to stop evil is punctuated with naivete, innocence, and a sense of justice and humor. With no Spiderman to distract him, Venom can form a friendship with his parasite that, as they shamble away together, may remind some of the super classic, Casablanca. Hardy is no Bogey, but his Brock is quirky and eccentric enough for me to hope for a sequel, even with Spiderman to distract.","

"Leofwine_draca","20 January 2020","VENOM is a surprisingly awful Marvel adaptation that doesn't sit at all well with the usual likes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its generally effective comic book adaptations. This one's far sillier and more nonsensical, as token bad guy Riz Ahmed works on some alien nasties in a laboratory and weird reporter Tom Hardy gets infected. The plot is as simple as that, but what is there to enjoy here? Hardy is known for eccentric characters and they often work (check out MAD MAX: FURY ROAD) but here he just comes across as annoying and his American accent doesn't sound good either. The second half moves into predictable comic book territory, i.e. an overload of CGI effects and not much in the way of thought. Things remain tame despite attempts at a harder edge, and the decision to have the alien talk made it all laughable for me.","

"burkholdermicah","3 October 2018","Venom is a truly Epic Superhero or SuperVillain Movie. It's a really Entertaining Watch, It's well Directed, The Action Scenes are Great, and it shows that even Spider-Man really can be Great. Venom is a truly terrifying beast and this is a really Amazing Movie. This is way better than what the Critics say about this Movie. They really don't know what they are talking about, and this is one of those really rare occasions when the Critics are wrong about almost everything. I am honestly disgusted by the Negativity revolving around this Movie. I don't know why they would prefer Amazing Spider-Man 2 over this Movie. I will definitely be looking foreword to the Sequel and all of the other SuperVillain Movies to come. If you're a Marvel Fan, if you're a Spider-Man fan, if you love going to the Theaters, and if you're a 100% Movie fan then you should definitely Go Out And Watch This Movie and ignore those Darn Critics!","

"ferguson-6","4 October 2018","Greetings again from the darkness. For those movie-goers who believe there is no need for another comic book movie, you now have People's Exhibit A. This is the 5th Marvel film of 2018 (yep, that's a new one every other month!), and it's the first one proving challenging to say much of anything that is positive or complimentary. The packed house at the screening had very few reactions during the movie, and seemed deflated afterwards.It should be noted that this is not a Superhero movie, but rather a film based on the Marvel Comic characters and stories of Todd McFarlane and David Michelinie. Four writers are credited with the screenplay, and it seems they either needed more or fewer. Director Ruben Fleisher (ZOMBIELAND, 2009) apparently worked with what he was given, hoping the stellar cast or the CGI could salvage the project. The always terrific Tom Hardy (Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) stars as Eddie Brock, a renowned investigative reporter popular for breaking stories of corruption and fraud. Unfortunately, he has a significant lapse in ethics - an unusually forthright comment from Hollywood on today's media. This lapse costs Brock his job, his girlfriend (4 time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams), and any semblance of normalcy. While investigating the unimaginable human-alien experiments of megalomaniac Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), Brock takes on the powers of the symbiote (Venom) and spends the rest of the movie either trying to control these powers, sitting back and letting the powers take over, or exchanging frat boy dialogue with the possessive being who picked up all nuances of the English language pretty darn quickly.Venom was last seen in the lackluster SPIDER-MAN 3 and was played by Topher Grace. This time out, Venom is the focus and Spidey is nowhere to be found or mentioned ... at least not until post credits (a terrific animated sequence). The CGI is at times very impressive - reminiscent of something John Carpenter might have ordered. Two sides of the Transamerica Pyramid provide a nice visual, however, the effects are not at all consistent. Far too often ... especially the battle between Venom and Riot ...it's just plain messy (like letting a group of toddlers play with black and gray slime). The film's saving grace could have been the interactions between Mr. Hardy and Ms. Williams, both stellar actors, but the dialogue and situations are so ridiculous that even those scenes don't click. The moments that draw laughter from the audience may or may not have been by design, but there are far too many 'forced comedic moments' that just fall flat. Composer Ludwig Goransson (CREED, BLACK PANTHER) delivers some nice moments with the score, but the Eminem song over the closing credits sounds amateurish. The film is very loud, and not so much lacking direction as it is burdened with too many directions and misfires. A comic book movie's first priority is to be fun, and this one just isn't much of that. Surprisingly, the film is rated PG-13 rather than R, so the excessive violence (and there is plenty) never actually spills a drop of blood. Perhaps the goal was to make a Marvel movie so uninspiring that BLACK PANTHER's Oscar chances would be enhanced. Otherwise, there's no excuse.","

"paul_haakonsen","1 December 2018","Right, well granted my lack of interest in superhero movies, then I couldn't exactly claim to be thrilled when this movie was announced, even so when it hit the cinema. So it was only when given the chance to watch it that I got around to it. Can't exactly claim that ""Venom"" was high on my movies to watch.First of all, well aside from it being a superhero movie, then I wasn't particularly enthralled with it being Tom Hardy having the lead role. Not much of a fan of his, to be honest. But I will say that he carried the movie quite nicely, despite having very little to work with in terms of a thoroughly-crafted script. Yeah, the storyline was fairly simplistic, and the script was almost so light-weight that it was non-existing.The special effects and CGI in the movie were adequate. They weren't the kind that have you going ""wow, that's spectacular and impressive"". So for a movie made in 2018 it felt that they cut back on the effects budget in a way.Now, I was having a bit of a hard time whether to take the movie as a serious movie, or if it was meant to be a comedy. Venom was all over the place, in terms of it being a comedy movie or a serious movie, and even had elements that bordered on horror on it. But it was sort of hard to take some of the things that Venom said seriously.I wasn't impressed by ""Venom"". And to be honest, then it would have taken very little to impress me, because I am not a fan of superhero movies and tend to avoid them. I am sure that there is a fanbase for ""Venom"" out there, but for us that aren't attuned to the superhero genre, then ""Venom"" had very little to offer in terms of entertainment, aside from being a generic action movie.","

"CinemaClown","28 November 2018","A strong contender for the worst film of the year, Venom is an amalgamation of terrible direction, piss-poor writing & fidgety performances that crashes n burns Sony's hopes of launching its very own shared universe on a positive & promising note, for there isn't one thing redeemable in this incoherent & inconsistent mess.The story follows Eddie Brock, an investigative reporter who while enquiring into a major corporation's malpractice comes into contact with an alien symbiote that was brought to Earth by their probe. As the two species achieve full symbiosis, he is imbued with superhuman strength & a violent alter-ego that calls itself Venom.Directed by Ruben Fleischer, the film fails to pave the necessary groundwork and it doesn't get any better after the first act either. The whole thing feels hurried & chaotic, unsure of what it wants to be, as the plot becomes more ridiculous with every passing moment. Fleischer's direction is lazy and the writing is even worse.All its attempts at humour fall flat, the dialogues are cringeworthy and whatever action it has in store has no sense of excitement whatsoever since the characters are so poorly sketched that we are never invested in them. Not a single person in this story exhibits an interesting arc and the eponymous anti-hero is a total joke.Coming to the performances, Tom Hardy is monstrously bad as both Eddie Brock & Venom. He is way too fidgety as if high on drugs, long before becoming a host to the alien symbiote, and his act is as stupid as it is laughable. Michelle Williams & Riz Ahmed happily dent their acting careers for a healthy paycheck. Also, for a $100 million budget film, the VFX looks absurdly dated & cartoonish.On an overall scale, Venom is a lethargic, listless & lifeless blockbuster that easily goes down as one of the worst examples of its kind. Failing to provide a sense of intrigue at any given time, it's one idiotic segment stacked on top of another for a total of 112 minutes and just when you think the film has got nowhere to go but up, it surprises you. A dud in all aspects of filmmaking, Venom is no less than an absolute eyesore.","

"dogmaticdogs","6 October 2018","I wonder if all the hate is because Sony produced this film outside of the Marvel Studio universe because I actually found it very entertaining. There was a lot of action, and the special effects were very good. The movie theater was full, and many people were laughing out-loud and clapped after the movie. Yes, the main character was kind of corny, but I found Venom's human ego less corny than Iron Man or Captain America. I also found it refreshing that it occurred in a world that wasn't already occupied by other super heroes. It seemed more realistic and adult oriented than other marvel character movies, but I would have preferred it being a bit darker rather than light hearted.I am not a huge fan of super hero movies other than Dark Knight, but I really enjoyed this. It shouldn't win any awards, but if you like the genre, I found it better than most. The movie suggested that Tom Hardy was a loser before he became Venom. If he was a loser, what the hell does that make me?","

"gerry_barnaby","3 October 2018","Venom is it any good.......... Well i'l be honest it good but there is a lot of issues I had with it, the certification isn't one, which im glad they took it to at least a 15 cert instead of the stupid 12A- PG-13 route because it allows the character to be a bit better, but I do feel the R-rating would have been better.The Biggest problem with Venom being a low certification is carnage, which could be in a sequel if this film is a success in box office, its need to push it to R-rating because of the PG13- 12A, 15 certs won't work for it.Not that im saying this venom film was a disaster because it's not but the film does have some major issues in it casting and storytelling, which is a shame because there are areas in this film that were generally funny (mainly the building scene) The humour is very sarcastic from the character of venom, so it gonna be that moment unless you find sarcastic humour funny, you might not like the humour in this film. Tom Hardy hardy performance is brilliant in playing the report asking the hard the questions and pushing boundary that everyone doesn't dare ask, this is how the real reporter gets the hard truth and doesn't makeup thing for a story.Tom performance give a great scared and vulnerable person when he first meets venom, giving off a guy that has no clue what the hell is going on which sell the character more, Venom himself is a awesome character but so hell back slight with the Certification. I noticed at the beginning of the film, which not a lot of people born after the 90s won't know about is the very scene at this point was actually the original storyline of Venom origin to earth with a slight story chance that was more plausible for the story which did help.We get a lot of great fight scenes through the film, with a few moments of funny humour (if you can get the sarcastic humour) while the film does maintain some element of that dark edge. The visual effects are great on venom especial the humour, but there is an area with the visual that is bad. This sadly is where im gonna have to rip into the film bad points there a few of them. Dislikes: 1. Casting. Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake / Riot, Riz is a good actor, even I can see that but playing the antagonist villian in the film, ya sorry just wasn't feeling it, not sure if it was the writing for character or just the way he was he's portraying this role, he just didn't have that ruthless charismatic tone to be a character. This sadly makes the villian of the film very generic which I hate because it pulls the film down.2. Casting. Michelle Williams playing Anne Weying, Again Michelle is a great actress ive seen her is so many great films where she shined given a great performance in those films. Here in venom again great performance but I feel she was the wrong casting for this role, I'll explain, there was zero chemistry between William and Hardy on the screen. Which made the romance and relationship together feel forced instead of feeling a natural connection with each other, I feel this Me to concept just didn't work in this film. 3. Visual effects. The motorbike chase there is a moment where it takes you out of the immersion of the chase which blantant Green screen shots, there was a moment where you can blatantly see that a stunt scene that it was Tom Hardy on the bike and a stunt double. I feel the close up scene of Tom Hardy on the bike were unnecessary, could have been edit out the film, because the rest of the scene was perfect.4. The story. The story felt very generic, Venom didn't show up until almost halfway through the second act but before we could get any build up with a showdown with Riot, the film was already over, this is where the writing failed. You have too many people writing on a story you get a mess of a film because of it, the direction of the film is going in serval direction and the moments that just don't seemly fit together. The flow of the film with it pacing is off which is bad for the film, this is why this film comes off great but still generic, I mean the whole build up between Roit and venom should have been from the end of the first act and not dragged out until the halfway through the second act. This is why I feel the film is Great in places but overall generic where the film could've been better. Overall: Great acting, Funny sarcastic moment, Great but generic story and bad casting with a generic villian","

"bastille-852-731547","16 October 2018","Despite poor reviews from critics, ""Venom"" is making quite a lot of money at the box office right now. Maybe it's because of the popularity of the character, or maybe even the fact that some casual audiences may (incorrectly) believe it is part of the MCU. I didn't think it looked very good and was not planning to see it in theaters originally, and only went to see it because of an online ticketing coupon which made it free. That said, I went in optimistic, as there have been some films this year that looked unappealing yet I ended up finding them enjoyable (e.g. ""The Spy Who Dumped Me."") But despite my optimistic sentiment, ""Venom"" was not just bad, it was really bad.I like Tom Hardy as an actor, but his acting is incredibly weak here. He is not really given much of a range to work with, which isn't necessarily his fault, but his portrayal of Eddie Brock is wholly unconvincing. The film's ""origin story"" tropes are rather tired, but that's nothing compared to the film's atrocious script. The script for this film is one of the worst in recent memory, with unbelievably cheesy dialogue or very cliché dialogue (e.g. Brock saying ""what is wrong with me?"" after feeling sick, etc.) coming at the viewer in almost every scene. Additionally, the film's tonal mishaps give the film a major identity crisis. ""Venom"" can't decide whether it wants to be an action-comedy a la traditional Marvel movies or a sci-fi horror flick a la ""Alien."" The problem is that the movie struggles with both tones. The attempts at humor in the movie feel incredibly forced and unfunny. Despite some creepy images of body horror and one or two jump scares, the movie is not particularly scary either. As a result, the movie just feels like a mishmash that was thrown together. The only remotely decent thing about it is an engaging car chase scene about halfway through. Definitely not recommended. 2/10","

When I watched the trailers I can defo say I was impressed with the Venom Suit, this is how the suit should look like rather than the Spider-Man 3 VersionI wanted to like this movie however I walked out so disappointed- Tom hardy is a very good actor who had the ability to get under the skin of a character I.e Bane, Mad Max, Bronson however in this case he just wasn't any good, He doesn't actually give justice to the roleThe plot made no sense and had no flow... there wasn't a single character that stood out that made the movie worth watching. The director really took on something more than he couldnt handle..As for the CGI wow it was really really bad... it was like a 10 year old doing it... where on other marvel studio movies the CGI looks really impressive It felt like Venom CGI was rushed and done by amateursI left the movie feeling quite disappointed and thinking had Marvel Studios had the rights on Venom they could have made this a really good movie.The critics have got this Spot OnFinal thought - Don't waste ur time and money on this movie and if there is to be a Venom 2 I really hope Marvel Studios make it!","

In the end it's going to be better off without the MCU formula being forced down everyone's throat with her tired themes and tropes. Eddie Brock's/venom's Symbiote story is a very intriguing one that doesn't necessarily need Spiderman to succeed and I think this will prove a lot of people wrong and stupid for doubting it. Also the critics...don't even get me started on how terrible and pretentious these loony critics are where they dismantle every film that does not fit their liberal PC propaganda. The fact that there are so many sheep that will blindly follow these mindless cretins and let them dictate whether not they enjoy or see a movie R just sad human beings without any free thinking ability .

"Offworld_Colony","12 February 2020","A film that seems to have been written in the 90's, desperate to keep a lower budget, a PG13, and a wide audience so it doesn't bother being a good horror, a good antihero movie, or a good sci-fi. It sort of manages to be a passable buddy movie but only just, and probably due to a bonkers Tom Hardy who is clearly having the time of his life.
There's so much in the idea to have unlimited potential, and yet it's a hole-ridden, lily-white superhero film with only marginally more actual Venom than Raimi's Spider-Man 3, and all the beats of a run of a mill early superhero film. Unfortunately since Deadpool, a Venom movie would have to have upped its game. Sometimes it's fun, most of the while, it's depressingly by the numbers.","

"BandSAboutMovies","28 December 2018","Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad), Venom has appeared on plenty of worst of lists this year. I held back judgment until I saw the movie. I can sum it up in one word: underwhelming. But after all, who was clamoring for a Venom movie after Spider-Man 3? Who was needing one in 2018? And after the magic of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, why do filmmakers feel they can still be so lazy with superheroes?
That said, Venom is critic proof. After all, it was a box office success, ultimately earning $855 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.It all comes down to one good thing: Tom Hardy. It's like this dude has to have the craziest voices in movies. His Eddie Brock voice is just the most need to please accent ever, while Venom, in his own words, is a ""James Brown lounge lizard."" The relationship between these two characters -- who become one person -- is the best part of the movie. Hardy also improvised a lot, such as when he jumps into a lobster tank to cool down. I kind of love that the dude was pretty much making up his own film. The actor claimed that he based his performance on Woody Allen, Conor McGregor and Redman.Everything else -- from the villains to Eddie Brock's relationships -- is as generic as it gets. Big points for having Jenny Slate in here, even if she does nothing. It's like the film felt it had to give us an origin when all we want to see is Venom break stuff. The end of the film, where he eats a criminal and meets Cletus ""Carnage"" Kasady (and come on, who doesn't want to watch Matthew McConaughey against Hardy in a battle of accents and overacting) is exactly what everyone really wants, not nearly two hours of generic soldiers and Venom battling Elon Musk.In the spin of selling this movie, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch claimed that ""Venom was considered a spin on a horror film, inspired by the works of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, but with more pop and fun."" People that say these kinds of things have never seen films by these two directors. Get their words out of your mouth and make better movies.The hard part of this whole thing is that there's a tease of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which will either make you say, ""I should have just watched that"" or ""Man, that was such a better movie.""","

But it was no more than the typical Marvel disappointment.It wasn't poorly made in terms of budget or even acting, really - it's just a little shallow and boring. Tom Hardy is a quite unlikable character, and even when he gets Venom he can't pull it off. There is one well choreographed motorcycle scene though, and that's the reason for the three stars I gave it. And who on earth was Woody Harrelson supposed to be?My biggest question is how this Venom fits into 'Spider-Man 3.' 'Venom' is

"Marvo2369","3 October 2018","When I went to see venom I was expecting the worst (violent content wise), expecting gore, blood, etc. and for it to be a proper horror film. Although the film had its intense, scary moments, it was another marvel comedy. However, this was a pleasant surprise and made the film even more enjoyable. Tom Hardy played the role brilliantly, absolutely nailed it. But do not expect a violent horror film. The three times he did eat someone's head, it was either not viewable to the audience or contained no blood and gore and happened mostly off screen. Apart from all of this, the film felt short, rushed at points and the direction of the story changes throughout. I would still say it is a must see as I thoroughly enjoyed it.","

"horrorgasm","9 December 2018","I'll admit, going into this I expected it to be hot garbage and I was slightly surprised to find that I was wrong, it's only lukewarm garbage, which is almost worse because there was clearly a lot of money and talent thrown into this movie, but it's all completely wasted on lazy, apathetic writing and inept directing and editing. It's just such a missed opportunity. This could have been a good movie if they had just put some effort into it.Look, I have nothing against mindless action movies, but there's absolutely nothing impressive about this one. The plot, the jokes, the characters, the action scenes...they're all terribly flat and generic. Everything about this movie is painfully mediocre except for a few brief moments of high-priced CGI, and even that ends up being mostly underwhelming because the scenes containing it range from bland to awful.Even if you turn your brain off entirely and are hugely obsessed with the character of Venom, even being generous, this is AT BEST an utterly average movie, deserving of nothing more than a 6 or 7. Personally I'd rate it at around a 5 because even if you ignore everything but the action scenes, it's still an entirely forgettable experience that I'll never watch again. In the end though, I'm giving it a 1 just to balance out the absolutely insane number of people giving this generic cash-in movie a 10. If any of you are actually real people and not just paid shills, your level of self-delusion is embarrassing.","

Almost 40 minutes were cut out and those scenes were Hardy's favorite moments shooting this film. Hardy was the best part and honestly the only good thing about the film. Everything else was a mess. I appreciate that Sony tried to be as comic accurate to the character as possible, but it wasn't enough. The tone was everywhere. I can't even begin to tell how bad on what they were trying to do, because I don't even know. Side characters do their part and that's that. I don't understand why the even want to try go with a PG-13 rating. Venom doesn't need the MCU and the MCU doesn't need venom. If the movie would have stayed with the R rating. It would have been a better movie for sure.","

"dhdregun","9 October 2018","Venom isn't a Marvel movie, for that it succeeds far more than if it had been. If you're getting tired of the Marvel formula then Venom is going to be a breath of fresh symbiotic air. Venom occupies it's own universe, it's dark, gritty and more grown up compared to its counterparts. The existence of Eddie's personal life feels real, his struggles are far more relatable than any other character portrayed in a comic book movie so far. He is an everyday guy who screws up and because of that his need to redeem himself gets him attached to a symbiote. After that hes just trying to stay alive until the very end when the truth of his circumstance means he is the only one who can prevent humanities destruction. The movie didnt lead up to this, it wasnt even known what was to come until the last 20 minutes of the movie.This is a marriage of two separate movies and it's done very well. You remove Venom and the movie feels like it could stand on it's own with a few key changes. The Venom portion hits all the notes required for a superhero movie. You actually care about Eddy and it's not because they give some sappy back story about loss or self reflection. You care because you can actually relate with what happens to him and how you may have reacted in the same scenario. He wasnt rich, a god or born with powers, didnt live with super advanced technology or volunteer for an experiment. Hes just a guy with a 9-5 in a regular relationship and living in the same world where shake downs and homelessness exist.The critics wanted a different movie then what they got. They wanted a basic Marvel super hero movie without realizing one of the better super hero movies as of late (Logan) didnt follow that formula either.Venom is the movie that stands on its own by creating a story with elements suited to the character, not checkboxes like others. Its entertaining and feels like it could have lasted longer. I'd rather feel left wanting then feeling like the movie is now requiring me to continue watching it because it's been dragged out too long.I'd rather watch another Venom movie then any other marvel universe sequel at this point.","

And nothing is explained well at all.I feel like either Will Arnett or Will Smith would have done a better job as Eddie Brock. And maybe that might have made this movie worth watching?","

"Felixhug","30 November 2018","There are so many Marvel movies produced now, that it becomes hard to be actually entertained by them. They really have to be of exceptional acting and writing to overcome the foreseeable outcome. All the fake action and blue screen shots and all the fancy tricks...its just not enough anymore.While i really loved some of the Marvel adaptions and other comics coming to the screen as well, this one was not one of them. I find myself gravitating to better, more original movies, or at least something if it has to be so predictable that is of superior excecution. None of it is to be seen in Venom. It all comes across as: Not again the same boring storyline!Luckily there where some better action movies this year that made up for it with real action such as MI. Thanks god there are still people like Tom Cruise, who actually take pride in what they do.

Source of alien is a stretch, and corporate won't pass on its chance to make a killing (pun). Alien has all the right attributes - creepy crawly slimy sucking extendable's; loads of predation razor teeth; a tongue to tickle your palette; and it sort of talks.

"CriticalOfEverything","3 October 2018","Just when I thought that NOTHING could top The Happytime Murders as the worst movie of the year, Venom comes out. I already thought the movie looked awful and the writing from the trailers was atrocious, but surely it couldn't of been worse than all the other terrible movies I've seen this year, right? Venom is a mess. It is only able to be enjoyed ironically. It feels INCREDIBLY dated. If this movie came out 10 years ago like it should have then I could probably excuse it, but it decided to come out in 2018. The writing is atrocious and it has one of the most inconsistent tones ever. Is it meant to be a horror/thriller? Or is it meant to be a comedy? Having comedy and darkness spread throughout your movie is fine but with Venom it just feels like they had no idea what tone to give it. Eddie Brock is also a massive moron in this movie and I'm just so disappointed with the fact that there will never be a good movie to use Venom well. Spider-Man 3 was utter garbage and used Venom poorly, and now this movie, with it's ONE GOAL of trying to make Venom work in a movie, fails on every level. Please don't see this if you want a thrilling and serious movie. This isn't that. This is a top notch comedy act done by Tom Hardy's terrible casting for this role.","

"Quebec_Dragon","4 October 2018","As other reviews pointed out, the tone was all over the place and the comedy didn't mix well with the darker parts. As a horror movie, it failed because there was poor tension, creepiness and no gore despite the potential. As a comedy it failed because it was not really funny for me even though some Venom fans laughed at his every line (why?). The action parts were too busy, chaotic and hard to follow, especially when Venom was involved. Tom Hardy really tried hard and emoted a lot, sometimes too much, but ended up looking goofy and dumb too often. The events of the plot felt rushed, and sometimes downright stupid. In fact, repeatedly, the behaviour of the characters didn't seem believable. Overall, this movie irritated me and reminded me of bad, older superhero movies (even though Venom is no superhero, I know). I watched this at an advance screening in a full theatre, and there was no applause at the end.Rating: 3 out of 10 (poor)P.S. For Marvel fans, there's no real connection to the rest of the universe, so you can easily skip it or wait for home viewing.","

Tom Hardy is just brilliant, totally believable as the down and out who inherits a new lease of life and new host inside him. There is immediate rapport between them with some real laugh out loud moments. He definitely understands comedic timing. 
Michelle Williams supports perfectly and is never over the top nor surplus to requirements. 
Riz Ahmed holds his own and comes off just with the right amount of 'bad'.
The action sequences are well done, often at night and deliver without over cooking it. 
Overall, two hours whizzes by and yes, the plot is not going to surprise you and you pretty much know what's coming, but the ride is well worth it in the end. Definitely a Marvel movie I would watch over and over and I can't say that for a lot of Marvel movies to be honest. Recommend! Don't believe the anyi-hype. Go see!","

"Jared_Andrews","5 October 2018","Venom the movie, much like Venom the character, is a sloppy, amorphous mishmash that attempts to be too many things and ultimately fails at all of them. At various times, it tries its hand at horror, slapstick comedy, self-aware comedy, romance and drama. That's an ambitious combination that would make any movie difficult to take seriously, let alone one with a wisecracking alien blob monster.The chilling opening scene shows a private space exploration mission return to Earth with samples of alien symbiotes. Shockingly, something goes wrong, one sample escapes and jumps between human hosts, searching for the best fit. It's a chilling sequence that sets the tone for a much darker story than what actually follows. In a jarringly clunky transition, the story jumps to Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy doing his idea of a New York accent) and his fiancé, Anne (Michelle Williams) living happily in San Francisco. Hardy goes all in on playing the anxious, twitchy guy who is great at his job but is also kind of a loser and has the most peculiar gait. He walks the way someone would walk if you told them, ""hey, walk in the weirdest way possible, like in a way that no one would ever actually walk."" It's completely transfixing. Eddie's awkward walk aligns with his natural tendency to create awkward situations. He is a successful reporter who is known for pushing boundaries, so it's only too obvious what he will do when interviewing shady billionaire, Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), for what is supposed to be a puff piece. In another less-than-stellar transition, the timeline fast-forwards six months and shows Eddie's life in shambles. This might have been affecting if any of this felt earned, but certain essential scenes are absent and were likely trimmed in editing to put the final runtime under two hours. Choices like these give the entire film a rushed, erratic feel of something that had ideas but didn't know how to piece them together into a fluid story arc.Meanwhile, all this has happened and still Venom has yet to make an appearance. The movie spends too much time on nonessential plot points and takes too long to reach the most compelling and entertaining parts. In other words, the movie is called Venom, so put Venom in the movie. When Venom finally shows up, the movie finally has life. Sort of. Venom and Eddie exchange banter that occasionally delivers winning punchlines, a few of which caused outbursts of laughter throughout the theater. That's great. The problem is the dozens of other jokes that were met with crickets or confusion. This might be due to Venom's abrupt language advancements. He quickly evolves from monosyllabic commands of ""food!"" to offering insightful romantic advice. It's another case of unearned plot and character development. But the worst parts of the movie are the incomprehensible and nearly unwatchable action sequences that didn't follow any discernable rules of continuity or visual logic. I didn't know where to look and half the time I didn't even know what I was looking at. That's the downside of fight scenes that rely too heavily on CGI. The climactic fight scene involves a bizarre swirling tornado of Venom and another blob monster that is meant to resemble a warrior-like battle, but the comically wide-open mouths and tongue swinging turns the display into something that looks more like a sloppy teenage make out session.It's a dumb scene in a dumb movie that never quite figures itself out. Marvel has made many great movies over the past 10 years. Venom is not one of them.","

"cherold","17 April 2019","I hadn't intended to watch Venom after hearing of its critical drubbing, but when I saw it got a respectable 6.8 from user reviews I thought maybe it was worth taking a look.It wasn't. It isn't.This first thing to be said about Venom is it is really, really boring. The setup, in which we see Eddie Brock's pre-Venom life, goes on forever (well, maybe a half hour), interspersed on with a few look-how-evil-I-am scenes for the villain. At a certain point I started using the skip-forward button on my video player to see if I could find where the action started.As for the action, it was fine, I suppose. Venom's shape-shifting abilities lead to some decent moments. Not *great* moments, but decent.In fact, if you removed all the non-action scenes you'd have something short but tolerable. But it would be very short, because even when the movie kicks into its highest gear, there's still a lot of down time.The repartee between Venom and Brock is okay, but Upgrade, which I haven't seen yet, has a more entertaining take on the same basic concept in the *trailer*.Some critics described this movie as awful but entertainingly so. This is not true. This is unentertainingly awful. It should not be watched, by anyone, ever. The people rating it highly on IMDB should seek psychiatric help.","

"roel-willemsen","11 October 2018","Overall, the film was extremely disappointing. Its positive points include Hardy's performance and the restaurant scene, one of the more uncomfortably funny scenes in a while. 
The pacing of the film is entirely off, starting of semi-promising, but having no Venom in the first half of the film and following it with a string of basic and bland CGI fights was not the way to go. The CGI is probably the worst part of the film, ranging from mediocre to downright awful. Especially the scene where the symbiote moves out of Eddie Brock's body to talk to him reminds of the 1997 film Spawn, aka awful. 
The script and dialogue are terribly basic. Michelle Williams is wasted as a love interest and is given some of the worst dialogue in the film (""I told you I could fight dirty."") 
Riz Ahmed's bad guy is somewhat interesting in human form, though his motives are never thoroughly explained, but in symbiote form he's downright awful. 'Riot' shows up suddenly at the end of the film as the big bad and is then promptly defeated in a boring CGI fight.
Furthermore, the best thing about Venom in the comics is that he's an anti-hero, something that doesn't shine through in the film. Eddie Brock's conflict about whether or not deciding to accept the symbiote is overshadowed in the plot and I believe that the film would have profited from an R-rating.
Sony should probably just let Marvel do all the work from now on. Having Hardy's Venom team up with Tom Holland's Spider-Man to take on Woody Harrelson's Carnage is a film I would like to see.
To conclude, don't waste your time with this boring attempt at an anti-hero movie.","

"TheMovieDiorama","11 October 2018","Oh dear. Superhero fatigue really is hitting hard this year. Sony is attempting every possibility just to keep the rights of a superhero intellectual property that is ""in association with Marvel"". Trying to kickstart yet another cinematic universe. I have no objections for these kind of blockbusters. As long as they entertain, they serve their purpose. This though, this is the complete opposite of entertainment. It's a catastrophic symbiotic mess. Eddie Brock, a well renowned journalist, loses everything by undertaking one interview. A few months later, he encounters a extraterrestrial life form known as Venom, where the two must stop another ""symbiote"" from destroying the world. Subjectively speaking, this is the worst blockbuster of the year for all the wrong reasons. But, let's start the review with some much needed positivity. Hardy, although incredibly miscast, commands onscreen presence and gives Brock a layer of likability. His schizophrenic-like behaviour with Venom manages to remain amusing, albeit frequently forced, reminiscent of the ""Buddy cop"" sub-genre. Venom, an anti-hero who suddenly turns into the world's saviour, maintains an enigmatic quality that feels alluring. Stan Lee's cameo is always a delight? I may be clutching at straws here for positive aspects, particularly with that last comment. There are so many underlying issues with Venom, that detailing them all would be a challenge in itself. Firstly, the narrative is tonally inconsistent. We have traits of the comedic 'Deadpool', action from 'The Incredible Hulk' and obviously the structure of 'Spider-Man'. It's not even inconsistent by scene, every act is so vastly different in tone that it doesn't feel like a complete film. Starting off as a generic romance, then breaking into the generic ""buddy cop"" action whilst also attempting to embed dark humour that forcibly feels negatively hilarious. The reason for this is the bad editing. Hardly any of the scenes have a narrative flow, with specific points in the plot being inserted at the incorrect time.This is particularly noticeable when portraying the antagonistic Carlton Drake, who's motives and backstory are thrown around like a ""symbiote"" on a rocket burning up through the atmosphere. One moment he wants to save humanity, the immediate proceeding scene portrays him wanting to destroy it. The horrifically written script, accompanied by unfunny quips that did not suit Hardy's acting talent, relies on an outdated superhero formula. Sony have failed to realise that these films have substantially evolved since the early 2000's. The ""save the world"" cliché and formulaic origin story are buried. Formulaic is an understatement, the story is atrociously predictable with its one-dimensional characters and heroic clichés that even the infrequent action scenes (all two and a half of them) couldn't generate any entertainment. The final showdown was a CGI ball of mess, making it particularly difficult to see what was actually happening. The motorbike segment was too pedestrian and lacked any excitement. Any combat scenes felt clunky and cumbersome, despite the innovative stunt choreography between Hardy and Venom. Ahmed gave a generically dull performance as the villain, one that I shan't remember anytime soon. Williams tried her best but again felt miscast as she attempts to create an emotional layer of depth between herself and Hardy. Oh, and Slate was underused, considering she has the most involving character. The slight comedic quips that Brock and Venom share are excruciatingly cringe inducing, trying so hard to make the audience laugh. There comes a point when Venom says ""pussy"", and I face-palmed so hard.Then we come to my favourite criticism of all. Plot conveniences. How did Drake know that Brock got the information from his girlfriend, leading to her firing? Venom was set on leaving Earth, how and why did Brock suddenly change his perspective? Why would he stay? (Don't even say because they are both ""losers""). How did Weying know to operate the speaker system at the launch pad? How did Venom survive? And why do megalomaniacs constantly keep killing their employees? Trust me, I really wanted to enjoy this. I went in with the best of intentions. But it's just not good. Completely outdated, utterly formulaic and so close to equalling the catastrophic disaster that was 'Fant4stic'. If it wasn't for Hardy giving a crazy Nicholas Cage performance by jumping into a fish tank brimming with lobsters at a restaurant, this would have nothing remotely amusing. Venom failed to find an antidote and instead succumbed to the poisonous traits of corporation cash grabbing by injecting no imagination or effort into the film, marking an all-time low in Hardy's career.","

"LoveofLegacy","12 October 2018","Venom has such potential as a character, but I can't help but feel the movie missed the mark. Even though it had some good moments and action sequences, the script was all over the place. I can't help but think that this movie didn't know what it wanted to be: action, horror, romance or comedy. It came off as a lukewarm mix of all four. I appreciated that they tried something new, but it's just not my thing.","

"nogodnomasters","15 October 2018","Rich man Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) brings back life from a passing comet. These life forms combine with humans and form a dual life. Reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) becomes one of those that combine with an alien. This is a different kind of superhero, more on the order of Deadpool who crosses lines of good and evil. Like most of the Marvel series, the film has great special effects, a long dragged out climax fight that is too long, humor, and a Stan Lee cameo. This one also has 1 F-word.","

"raskarl","3 October 2018","I went to this film with no real expectation beyond knowing that Tom Hardy was playing in the main role and Venom is from the Spider-verse. I walked away thinking what a fabulous job had been done to bring good mixture of action and comedy. I really enjoyed this film and am unsure why people would have rated it down. I've heard some say the acting was sub-par, that is not something I noticed to be honest. I don't go to these types of movies expecting Oscar worthy performances, but to be entertained for an hour or so. This film achieved that easily and surpassed expectations. I even had a few laughs thrown in for good measure.
If you are on the fence about whether to see this film, I would recommend you go see it - you're not likely to regret it. Also, I'm 80% there is going to be an epic sequel sometime in the not too distant future!
-Update; I went to see the film again for a second time...still hit the spot! Great soundtrack and there's a short clip about an upcoming animation film featuring some characters from the Spider-verse. It is literally buried right at the end of the credits (would have missed it unless I had to been told wait for it, so I'm paying it forward).","

"Andrew_Wiper","29 October 2018","Fun, wacky, over the top violence and a brazenly mad performance from Tom Hardy make this a pleasing experience at the movies. At under 2 hours it doesn't overstay its welcome. Ruben Fleischer who directed Zombieland, takes the director's chair For Venom and like Zombieland, makes a movie that you go to to have a good ol' time at the cinema! It doesn't take itself too seriously, has many moments of humour, and also many scary scenes too. Very cool visual effects! Tom Hardy only adds to the movie's likeability, because he knows how to play a down to earth character, and a mad man at the same time. The director and producers, it was said were paying a lot of homage to Films of David Cronenberg and John Carpenter. I couldn't help but think of The Thing while watching this, and yes if you enjoy movies like The Thing, and the crazy body horror of David Cronenberg, you will no doubt enjoy this. Take that and add it into a marvel movie about a hero/anti-hero and you have Venom. Sure they could have made it R rated, but honestly it didn't really bother me that much. It seemed like they pushed the PG-13 rating as far as they could go with this. A definite theatre watch! 8.5/10","

My entire group of 8 people thoroughly loved the movie, some even spouting that it was the best movie they'd seen in a few years. Now, here's the warning: you know how Marvel movies always have a clip after the credits?? Do NOT stay to watch the clip after credits. It is an ADVERTISEMENT for that terrible cartoon Spiderman that you'll likely see in the trailers. My group sat through 10+ minutes of credits to see what was after them, and we were lividly disappointed. It has nothing to do with Venom and it left us all genuinely angry. Please don't sit through the whole long list of credits only to disappoint yourselves. We all left the theater angry and ranting about it.","

"oliverriordan","1 December 2021","""Venom"" is a very unnecessary movie that does little to justify it's existence, with the movie banking heavily on the success of the character in the comic medium. In the end very little seems to happen, and while Tom Hardy is clearly giving his all, it doesn't save the movie from a bland and very mediocre final result.","

"hutomo_gates","3 October 2018","Nothing too special for the plot. A cliche plot for superhero movies, even though Venom is not a superhero. He is a Anti-hero. There are several dialogues that are not too strong to deliver the message. Some scenes should be epic but its ruined by some bad dialogues. Some actor's acting seemed futile with these deficiencies. The climax of final fight is not too 'wow'. The conclusions of final battle is not clear enough. Music score is not that specialSome positive aspects that can saved this movie are relationship between Eddy and Venom. Dialogues between Eddy and Venom can be ice breaker or melt the tense in some scenes. Some Eddy and Venom's interactions also generate some comedy scene and it's quite entertaining. Awesome final battle between Venom versus Riot. It's very exciting and the CGI is very quite stunning","

"Mccadoo","4 June 2019","I've suspected for some time now that many of the positive reviews on this site are bogus. Reading the reviews for this movie are the final proof I need;10 out of 10 reviews with over the top title lines like; ""Best movie ever"" or ""A masterpiece"". Hundreds and hundreds of them in which the reviewer writes a single paragraph, or even less at times, that does nothing more than tout how great the movie is and that you should ignore the critics and go see it. Something stinks here folks.And this movie convinces me because it got a whole lot of those 10/10 reviews and it is absolutely terrible. I mean, just awful. And yes, I know that here are a lot of brain dead drones out there who think any superhero movie is the equivalent of classic literature and gush over all of them, however awful they are. But not enough of them to account for so many 10's for such a bad movie.Why was it bad? Where do I start;Tom Hardy's character came across as a learning impaired teenager with a room temperature IQ. He talked liked a dolt, his actions throughout the movie made no sense, unless he was in fact at dolt. He was supposed to be a crack reporter yet his reporting style was atrocious and his sense of what reporters actually do was utterly absent. For a really good actor his performance was really bad.Michelle Williams; not even sure why she was in this movie unless it was for a paycheck. She was totally miscast and just not believable at all in her role. She couldn't pull of the funny bits (or what the director thought was funny) and she had zero chemistry with Hardy.The villain was about as villainous as a cranky high school kid. His actions in the movie were so illogical and senseless as to be stupid. You never understood what his motivation could possibly be because he didn't seem to know himself. And his staff were the most moronic bunch of scientists and doctors to appear on film since...well, since forever. As illogical and unmotivated as their boss was they were even more so. They were a bunch of sheep following along whatever he did. Oh, except for one of them, the woman who decided to turn whistleblower to Hardy's character then proceeded to do it in the most idiotic way possible. She may as well have come to work with a sign around her neck telling everyone it was her who let Hardly into the facility. Then she just sat in her office and waited to be killed. No one is that clueless.Humor; there was none even though the director and writer tried to inject it into the movie at every turn. Every single attempt fell so flat you could hear the thud in the theatre. The banter between Hardy's character and Venom sounded like the ramblings of two twelve year old's trying to be clever and failing miserably at it. It was immature and forced and just not funny. Michelle Williams character was just not clever, every time she tired to be edgy it was just embarrassing to watch. Trying to be Deadpool when you've already put together a putrid film is never going to go well.And finally, the CGI is this movie was truly awful. When I saw the previews I thought Venom looked like something from a kids Saturday morning cartoon show and assumed that in the movie it would be better. It wasn't, it still looked like a kids cartoon show. Venom was totally unbelievable as a real live entity, he just simply looked like a cartoon. And the non-threatening villain at the end even more so. They looked like special effects from a 80's or 90's movie only worse. Just absolutely terrible, I'd say it ruined the movie except that the movie was already ruined before Venom even made his first appearance.This is at best a mediocre children's movie, and I'm being kind. So yes, by all means DO believe the critics and avoid this train wreck at all cost.","

Yeah.. totally offputting.venom jokes are coolmain villain is god-awful level of ""i am bad so i'll do bad things like all bad guys do""Overall it's alot better than other SONY takes on heroes-genre (amazing sipderman crap ugh), but overall it's kinda meh.","

"The-Sarkologist","5 October 2018","Now that Spiderman is back in the hands of Marvel, well sort of, it looks as if Sony needs to start digging around with what's left to see if they can turn it into a franchise. Well, they've had two shots at Spiderman, one one of them did have Venom pop in as a sort of bad guy, but it seems that he now has his own movie, albiet a much darker one. Basically the story is that we have this evil billionaire who found some parasites in space and decided to bring them back to Earth. However the ship crashed and one of them managed to escape. The other three though made it back to San Francisco.
 Then we have our hero, who happens to be a reporter, and it seems that everything is going right for him, expect that he decides to start digging where he shouldn't be digging, and suddenly finds himself out of work and without a girlfriend. I guess that's what happens when an investigative reporter is just a little too good at their job, and also asks just one too many questions that they shouldn't be asking - billionaires, especially evil ones, have a really nasty habit of making life really, really difficult for you.
 However, it turns out that he is given another chance to start digging up some dirt on this guy, namely because one of his scientists decides that she really doesn't like, well, ignoring the rules, so she sneaks him into the lab, where he suddenly finds himself in the same room with one of the parasites, and is subsequently infected. So, he we have it, the Venom origin story. You can probably guess what happens from there though - he faces the bad guy, almost dies, but is eventually successful and things start getting back on track. Sure enough, we also have Stan Lee and a mid-credits scene that sort of teases us for the next film in the series.
 The thing that caught me with Venom though was that it didn't seem to be all that long. Look, that isn't a bad thing, and sometimes short movies can actually be pretty good movies, particularly since they drop all of the really boring stuff out of it. Yeah, this film was actually quite fun, though I did find that the Venom costume was just a little too tacky for my tastes. I would say that I liked the story, and the character, but when it came to Venom being Venom, well, it did come across a little bit too cartoonish, but then again I suspect that it is somewhat closer to the comics than the MCU heroes.","

"namikazedante","12 February 2019","I was expecting this movie to be terrible after so many was hating on it and today I finally got my chance to see it and I gotta say everyone especially in the media doesn't know what they're talking about.This movie is better than Spider-man: Homecoming. I really didn't like it. I mean it was okay but not even near what a Spider-Man movie should be like.Anyway ! This movie had jokes that were actually funny. A main character that you actually felt and cared for. I think they made a fantastic job with a anti-hero that would be very difficult to put in a good light. Especially someone as bad as Venom. But where was Tom Hardy when they made that awful version of Venom in the third spider-man movie? He is perfect as Eddie Brock. And I really hope they make another movie with Spider-Man and Venom.Anyway it was a exciting, fun and interesting movie. And don't listen to all the haters because this is a movie worthy a watch.","

"CANpatbuck3664","7 October 2018","In most big budget action movies, the first complaint you hear is CGI overload. This is one of the rare occasions where I can say the CGI being so impressive was one of the best parts of Venom. Venom looks awesome as a creature, the way they chose to animate his look and his movement was impressive. The movie is also shot pretty well, they shoot in a lot of dingy locations before Eddie (Tom Hardy) interacts with Venom to help ground the movie, and I thought the action was handled pretty well. I wish that we had got the R-rated version to really see the potential of what Venom could do as a villain, but I liked the majority of the action scenes regardless.We get to spend a decent portion of the movie with Eddie before we get introduced to Venom and while the overall plot isn't completely fresh, I didn't think it was as bad or as routine as the critics did. They aren't breaking new ground in the genre with Eddie's story from laughing stock to redemptive hero, but it gets the job done. We get some unique banter from Eddie and Venom that had me laughing at different times in the movie. It was also a little hit or miss (which is true for all the dialogue in the script), but I chuckled like everyone else in the theatre did. Did Venom have a few plot holes? Yes, it did but the movie doesn't linger on them and with Tom Hardy's crazy performance, I was able to go along for the ride Venom's cast features actors and actresses that I wouldn't have pictured being interested in this movie. Tom Hardy is a great actor and I think casting him was a good decision. He brings something to this role and he does as much as he possibly can with this material. My only note is that Eddie as a character seems to act like he's a little younger than Hardy, so he may be a little old for the part. But otherwise, he was one of the best parts of the movie. I really like Riz Ahmed too, he's transitioning to bigger and bigger projects and I've yet to see him in anything where he wasn't a standout (check out The Reluctant Fundamentalist and The Night Of). I think he's miscast here; the character calls for him to be a little more sinister and animated yet he's oddly reserved. He had his moments, he gives a speech to a test subject about the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac that was well delivered but they needed another actor. Michelle Williams rarely appears in blockbuster movies, she does her job capably, but she gets the short end of the stick. Her character is a little generic and aside from one scene, there isn't much for her to do here. I will also credit Jenny Slate who did a solid job in her scenes.The most pronounced criticism that the critics have lobbied against this movie that I can agree with is that the scene transitions in Venom are oddly sloppy. When I say that, I'm not referring to character decisions or to tonal swings (both have their off moments going into the final turn, especially with Eddie/Anne romance) I mean the movie just doesn't flow from scene to scene. There could be pieces missing that fill in the blanks (Tom Hardy's comments about the movie seem to indicate as much) but a good movie compares to an orchestral music piece. Despite so many elements being brought together, there's harmony. Venom lacks that consistency, you'll be wondering how characters arrived in certain places or how time is passing in an uneven way. I usually believe its poor editing, but I thought the fight scenes were cut together surprisingly well. I don't know whether to point the finger at the editor, the studio or the director but they could have done a better job, especially with such a big project.I don't want to make excuses for Venom but the last not I'll make was the movie was fun the whole way through. I never got the impression that the movie was taking itself very seriously (the interplay between Eddie and Venom was a little tongue-in-cheek) and that helped me get on board. Despite this not being a landmark for superhero movies, not every movie in the genre needs to be Infinity War and with the different vibe Venom goes for, there's enough here to keep you happy for the whole picture.Despite the negative word of mouth surrounding Venom leading up to the release, I was rooting for this movie. Walking out of the theatre, I thought of another film Ruben Fleischer directed called Gangster Squad. Similar to Venom, that movie had a lot going for it but tripped up in a couple of key areas (the worst being the horribly hammy dialogue). The character design, the CGI, the action and even the central performance are all good to great here, and I liked the fact that we're getting more anti-heroes instead of boy scout superheroes. But Venom also stumbles over corny dialogue, some miscast actors and actresses and a lack of polish that the top end superhero movies have. I would really like to see a sequel to this, maybe they'd be able to iron out more of the kinks on the second try and go for a little more edge. Venom is a mixed bag, but I think the good outweighs the bad easily and the critics were too harsh on this. I'd give Venom a 7.5/10 but I can't quite go to 8 on it so I must round down. If you're interested, go check it out but if you're not sold, waiting for it to be on your preferred streaming service isn't a bad idea.","

"BrickNash","8 October 2018","This is a highly enjoyable romp with quite a likeable anti-hero. Tom Hardy is both engaging and hilarious as both Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom, and the two and fro between the two characters is what really makes the film work.As a film though, it's fine, but relatively unspectacular. It follows a reasonably generic Marvel-style pattern which guarantees it's head is kept above water, but it also means that there is a little case of ""Seen it before"" happening. The script could be better and the CGI is pretty terrible and looks more like late 90s tier computer images.However the Venom personality, while essentially evil, becomes incredibly endearing towards the end of the film, and as such and ropy effects or script blandness were made redundant, plus I was left hoping for a sequel.If they can get a better script with sharper banter between Brock and Venom and have the film a bit less generic in structure then this could be a fantastic franchise all on its own. No Spider-Man required!All in all, a great start and a very entertaining film which has it where it counts.Recommended!","

"rgkarim","5 October 2018","Marvel holds many cards in the world of Hollywood, and despite the hope of a united universe, Sony pictures still holds off in giving us a united front for our superhero crew. Tonight, a new contestant enters the park, not so much a hero as an antihero, this creature has pulled in a noble fanbase and inspired a number of other characters in the process. If you've got the hints you know what I'm reviewing, so let's get started as Robbie K reviews: Movie: Venom (2018)Director:
 Ruben Fleischer
Writers:
 Scott Rosenberg (screenplay by), Jeff Pinkner(screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Marcella Bragio 
LIKES: The Dark Aspect: You'll see a lot of jabs at this movie, but this installment at least gave us a taste of the darker side of the titular character. The movie dips into how not everything is gold in the realm of superpowers, as well as how grey everything can really be in the complex world of humans vs. the unknown. It also allowed for some more intense action scenes to come into play, including some finishes the fanbase has been looking forward to for some time. The Action... sort of: There are moments in Venom that feel well at home with MCU level style of battling. Venom has at least two winning sequences for me that have explosions, choreographed take downs of extras, and some sweet utilization of CGI to bring out Venom's fluid, whip like movements to bare. It's not the most dynamic, but it is miles above his first appearance back in Spiderman 3. Sound Editing: Probably not what most are looking for, I enjoyed the sound effects brought by the movie team. You've got the alien slithering, the roiling growls of the hungry beast, plenty of speaker shattering booms, and enough effects to wrap together to make for the action scenes. Tom Hardy: The star of the show and perhaps the best casting call for this movie, Hardy is certainly the leading component of his film. His ability to play an awkward, down on his luck, vigilante reporter is quite spot on, as well as the uncanny ability to play a crazy person as well. It came off naturally, held good chemistry with the rest of the crew, and certainly was entertaining to watch him interact with a digital, altered voice of Venom. I've said it before, but Hardy's ability to play any type of role continues to be present in his acting. Comedy: Like most Marvel movies, Venom is loaded with comedy to get you laughing and ironically may be the biggest aspect of the movie. Both intentionally and unintentionally, the movie had me laughing, primarily at the banter between Venom and Eddie Brock through much of the movie. The insults are on point, the delivery of the lines, and even Venom's questionable morals are all entertaining for this reviewer and probably the biggest point one should go in wanting to see. The End Credits Teaser: Not fully relevant to Venom, the post credit scene is worth the wait and hints at a huge potential for the next Sony-Marvel production coming in December. A little teaser to see if you want to take a trip into that. DISLIKES: The CGI: Still better than anything I could do, Venom didn't quite have the same definition and attention to detail that its Disney infused brothers do. The graphic are a bit messy, for although fluid, looks like living spaghetti trying to take form in many ways. Perhaps an homage to the early 2000s graphic style, Venom needed some upgrading to match the graphic expectations that the movie fans most likely desire. The Story: Hinting and promising so much in the trailer, Venom's story department does hit the dark aspect that this antihero demands. Yet, it still took shortcuts for this film, skipping over a lot of build-up, character development, and even just plot development to get to the goods and comedy I guess. Other characters are very one-dimensional and shallow, relationships are very fickle and seem to switch faster than a light switch, and in many cases crosses into cheesy proportions that didn't work for me. Grandiose displays may be something that younger audiences like,, but the story element still needs some tweaking to get to the Disney level. The Other Symbiotes: I get this was the start of the franchise, but the advertisements really hammered into us the potential to see other creatures more than Venom take some screen time. Sadly, they skimped on these as well, forcing to barely touch on these creatures before moving on to another poor plot point. Even the main antagonist in this film didn't get much time worth warranting, once more digging at the weaker storytelling of this studio. Even Venom took some time getting himself on screen, a sad use of merchandising rights when it could have been so much better. The Anticlimactic Action: Venom does have some nice action scenes as mentioned before, but the problem is that they are often short lived or very carbon copy. The chase scene showed promise, and the first-time combat had its moments, but they utilized their tricks a little too quickly. The ending promised a potential to have a real, epic clash of the Symbiotic titans going, but again Sony cut the corners and left me wanting more to show off their powers. Venom was very underpowered in this film, and they did little to utilize the keys handed to them. The props for the mid-credit scene: Actor choice for the surprise guest at the film is 50:50 to me, but the props to make him come to life... not very good for me. Should a Venom 2 make it to the big screen, I'm hoping their wardrobe department makes some better efforts to get the next antagonist in. The VERDICT: Go in expecting a comedy and you will love this movie and have the most fun. However, in regards to the full picture part of the film, it still has more to develop before it meets expectations set by Disney. Hardy and some mediocre action scenes can bring some entertainment, but it doesn't quite hit the home run outside of that. It's a bit cheesy at times, a little overboard in terms of the comedy, and doesn't quite deliver on the action, other symbiotes or even the story. Yet, it has enough special effects kicks to warrant a theater visit, but only if you can handle the limitations mentioned. My scores are: Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0","

"classicsoncall","6 February 2019","I actually enjoyed this one pretty well and I don't know why. It's an average anti super-hero flick, and Venom (Tom Hardy) is every bit as snarly and drooling as his presence suggests on the comic book page. The movie version here bypasses any mention of his earliest association with Spider-Man, so it seems that that will be a sequel for another day. The tone of the story is darker than those of most in the Marvel universe franchise and a welcome break from the ones in which the hero saves the day just in the nick of time. I couldn't help feeling that the mastermind behind the Life Foundation was based on industrialist Elon Musk, who's many irons in the fire make him seem more than erratic at times. Riz Ahmed was somewhat one-dimensional in his portrayal of Carlton Drake, but what would you expect of an egomaniac who didn't mind squandering the lives of impoverished street people to achieve his personal goals?I'm a little conflicted on the character of Eddie Brock, nothing to do with Tom Hardy, but the way in which he's portrayed over the course of the story as that of a loser. Yeah, he lost his job because of his arrogance with Carlton Drake, but the guy had some integrity. However in becoming a host for the symbiote Venom, he's actually turning into a malevolent character with no qualms about taking out neighborhood scum. So it remains to be seen how the Brock/Venom dynamic progresses in the Marvel movie universe.My main regret, now that I've finally seen the picture, is knowing that this is the last film in which we'll get to see a cameo by the great Stan Lee, creator of many of the super-heroes in the Marvel Comics world. Before he passed on, he did get to voice his own cartoon character in the recent 'Spider-Verse' film, but this was his last physical presence in a live action flick. For those not in the know, he was the 'Dapper Dog Walker' near the end of the movie who tells 'both' Eddie/Venom not to give up on Anne (Michelle Williams). Physically he looked great on screen, which makes it all the harder to believe he passed away just a short month after the picture's release.","

"Justinpren","13 December 2018","Venom is a really fun movie. There's nothing serious or about the film - it's definitely not designed to portray a deep or meaningful philosophy of life or the vastness of human experience - it's designed to be enjoyable and exciting for people who like to pretend to shoot webs out of their hands or teleport down the street on their way to work or run at super sonic speeds when they're out on their jog. Venom is everything that makes marvel movies and comics what they are. Don't get sucked in by the negative reviews, spend an hour and a half watching Venom, you'll love it.","

"jackgdemoss","12 October 2018","PG-13. Comedic tone. Buddy comedy. This was NOT venom. This film is so difficult to give a fair rating. On the one hand, it stood very well on its own two feet. It was funny, well-paced, and had some really good-looking action scenes. On the other hand, it is being marketed as a VENOM movie. Venom is not some goody parasite that is willing to take orders from his host. 
 Most films benefit from tail coating on a brand name character, but this film was severely hindered by it. If you call this movie ""Symbiosis"" and market it as non-marvel, it is an 8/10 solid film for the whole family. I would much prefer a Venom title to be rated R, dark, gritty, and not holding back the punches. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and believe others should see it, but please do not go in with the mindset that you are about to see the Venom you know and love on the big screen.","

(especially at the end)As a normal viewer, your expectation of monster movie will be like the monster is a bad guy.However, this movie is really coming out of the norm. The monster looking like alien is actually a hero at the end and it was a loser. And it matches his partner on earth which is also a loser. So what do you get when you get two losers, double negative makes it positive. A hero therefore is born.Nice CGI, good story.This movie also has some fun dialogue and I enjoyed it very much. I think it is way better than all the spider man movies.I recommend this movie very much.I think the theme of the story should be. Scary is not from outside, it is from inside.

I mean sure, the CGI could be better, especially in the final fight between Venom and Riot, also R rating would make this movie even better, but it didn't change the fact that the movie is fun! The interaction between Brock and Venom was hilarious, and Tom Hardy is just, amazing.So, if you're hesitate to watch because of the horrible reviews, don't, we watch movies to have fun, not to try to find the mistakes the paid reviews says.

"rustonreviews","7 October 2018","I distinctly remember seeing Venom for the first time in the 90's animated Spider-Man series. I still own the VHS of The Venom Saga, which was the 3 part storyline that introduced the black suit and Venom to the show. Venom quickly became my favourite comic book villain. I wore out the VHS (I still own it for pure nostalgia) and sought out further Venom stories to devour. First appearing at the very end of The Amazing Spider-Man #299 (with #300 being his first full story), Venom immediately became a fan favourite and has since featured in countless classic storylines that have cemented his iconic status in comic book history. Sam Raimi's troublesome (yet over-hated) Spider-Man 3 introduced the first live action Venom to the big screen, with mixed results to say the least. Following the announcement of a stand alone Venom film (without Spider-Man and separate from the MCU), the general response from fans was confusion. Spider-Man plays a crucial role in Venom's origin, so his exclusion from the film felt like a critical step in the wrong direction. Nevertheless, Spider-Man's absence from the film is the very least of its problems. Journalist Eddie Brock (Hardy) has hit rock bottom. Following his investigation into the secret experimental trials taking place within the shady Life Foundation, he swiftly loses both his job as well as his relationship with district attorney Anne Weying (Williams). However, Brock soon finds himself ""bonding"" with an alien symbiote from another world, forging an odd alliance with the alien parasite to become the malevolent beast Venom. Together they must put aside their differences to stop Carlton Drake (Ahmed), the charming yet psychopathic leader of the Life Foundation, who believes he can use the symbiotes to upgrade mankind into a superior species. Venom is a disaster. Nothing in the film works. The script is badly paced with scenes that feel completely rushed and lazily constructed, and the storyline feels painfully underdeveloped. It all feels very first draft, and all sense of character development is sorely lacking. Hardy struggles to convey a solid Eddie Brock and gives a strange and sometimes goofy performance that does the character no justice whatsoever, and Ahmed's Carlton Drake feels disappointingly one dimensional. The motivations behind his villain plans are never made clear, resulting in one of the least interesting comic book villains in some time. A fundamental lack of chemistry between Hardy and Williams weakens the film. I never bought into their relationship and felt as though it added very little, if nothing at all, to the overall storyline. Although Venom himself looks fantastic on screen, it takes too long for him to finally make an appearance. Weirdly, the film introduces a strange ""buddy comedy"" element to Brock's relationship with the symbiote, resulting in some pretty awkward forced humour that feels as though it was injected into the film for the sheer sake of it. Unfortunately, the action sequences are also dull and uninspiring, and even the final battle feels criminally anticlimactic.The bottom line with Venom is that it's boring. It doesn't try to tell a good story, nor is it interested in making a faithful adaptation. Audiences who aren't familiar with Venom or his classic comic book storylines may enjoy the film as dumb popcorn entertainment. For those invested in Venom as a character, don't bother. Venom is a tedious viewing experience that makes me wonder just how they could have got it so catastrophically wrong.","

The action sequence are great especially the final battle but the human subplot drags it down a bit. Like maybe another swing at the script would have done good but oh well it's serviceable. Although humor drops the ball in some area. What I liked the most was finally seeing venom on the big screen.

"SeakDub","13 October 2018","Sony is turning Venom into another Spider-Man trilogy. Story - Boring and average. Certain parts of the movie were entertaining of the least. But most of the time you get emotionless dialogues that kill the vibe. Then on top of that the action scenes that if you blink you miss it parts. Way too much jumping around during the fighting. Looked like a bad CGI blur. Characters - Everyone in this movie was eh. Tom Hardy seemed to do the best job where everyone else was just an emotionless person with a Kristen Stewart face. Its like the movie cancels the good and bad out. Some moments it was cool and made you laugh. Then other parts were boring and wanting it to hurry up and move along. Besides Tom Hardy's character, everyone else you don't remember. And in my opinion, didn't like anyone.Venom - I did not know Venom's backstory much besides that I thought he was a villain and caused havoc. In this movie he was an anti-hero where you feel sorry for and wanted him to win. I was hoping after feeling sorry for the character Eddie Brock that he would turn into a killing machine and just destroy everyone. But no, he still has a heart that only kills the very bad, and that is a maybe. He was a villain in my mind but for all I know he could join the Avengers. I don't care that he is changing into an anti-hero but I was expecting to watch a man become a villain. Not the same ole stuff. Average - This movie is just average. I feel like I liked parts and other parts I didn't. At this point with all these superhero movies I was hoping for a different turn with a villain movie. But it ended up being just another superhero movie. You seen it once you seen them all. This movie deserves to be rated a 5 or 6 just for how plain it is. I decided to be nice and give it a 6. Judge for yourself but lot of people talking about how awesome this movie is. It is not. A slow build up backstory that has its moments but nowhere as good.All in all the movie could be a skip and you could wait for it to rent. I wouldn't rush this movie and just wait to rent it when you can. I just wished Venom was more villainous. It was suppose to be a different form of superhero movie and what we got was the same thing in a world of superhero movies. Skip theaters and rent it is my call.","

"jonnaharkenson","30 May 2022","A solid 8/10 rating. I am not a hardcore comic book guy nor am I one of those nitpicking film critics who criticize films too hard. The film was certainly entertaining and enjoyable, it was not a solid 10/10 rating like you'd expect from 'The Avengers' films but I personally think it's good and the story was creative.I grew up watching Marvel cartoons and collected their toys as a kid. This is a great spin-off film about Venom, which from my memory is supposed to be one of Spider-Man's prominent archenemies... though in this film, he is (or they are) the good guy(s) and not a bad guy.I liked the backstory of the film, and I really liked how the film was shot in San Francisco (they actually filmed on location for some scenes) and it's a nice change from New York City. The buildup and conflicts of the relationships of the characters were good: both the guy Eddie and Venom, and also Eddie and his supposed love interest, Anne (which was played by Michelle Williams whose acting was very good). And there's a good amount of humor between Eddie and Venom, and Tom Hardy who plays Eddie does an amazing job acting as both characters.There's a balance of action, humor, and a slight dark tone (though more action and humor). If anything, you'll at least enjoy the action scenes which were a combination of live action and CGI which looked pretty decent. The fiom is very easy to follow along with, especially if you have zero knowledge of any of the Marvel comics or films, there were no plot holes that I recall.Overall, I recommend this film.","

"arogalsky79","20 December 2018","Edge of your seat excitement, believable storyline, perfect mix of action, blood and wit, and you've got Venom! Don't understand what all the hate is for.After the autrocity that was Spider-Man 3, I have been patiently waiting for the redemption of a Venom portrayal that we all deserve. Although I was expecting a typical Spider-Man/Venom stand-off, doing a spin-off was the perfect move for this well-known and well-liked villain/anti-hero. Tom Hardy is, as ever, brilliant in his work and perfect for the choice. Though it might be too bold to say it was as good as Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight good, it just might come pretty dang close. My only complaint was that I felt we didn't spend too much time seeing Venom, and the movie ended somewhat quickly, despite it's running time. Not that it felt rushed or cut off, just that feeling of wanting a little bit more.While several people are pushing for the sequel to be R rated, I can see where they're coming from given the hint of Carnage at the end. However in my opinion, they will do better in the box office if they keep it at a rating adults are comfortable taking their under 17 children to. To me, more blood and violence isn't necessarily better. I would choose a good storyline and good acting over the blood and the gore. It may have worked for Deadpool, but not so much for this character. Alas, I am probably alone in this voice so it probably will be rated R, though I hope not. PG-13 is plenty. I felt this movie had the perfect amount of showing Venom's gruesome side without going completely overboard. I would like to take my boys to it when it when the sequel comes out.","

"scotty-27964","8 December 2018","There's some decent acting, some of the cgi is pretty good and the relationship between Eddie and Venom (Hardy acting with Hardy) has some entertaining moments. There's your three stars.
In all other areas this film falls woefully short. In a world where the bar for comic based films is constantly being raised this is a big disappointmen. The storyline manages to be filled with cliché, and be so simple and predictable and yet have huge plot holes.
-Charming genius millionaire (conveniently) owns space ships and pharmaceutical company, turns out he's bad.
-guy who's down on his luck but still friendly and generous, he's our goody.
the 'but no one will belive us' moment.-building with deadly things in has woeful security, bad thing gets out.
-For some reason this private security company are totally allowed to drive their huge 4x4s, chasing dangerously through the city without a single cop in sight (also they bomb a load of sh*t along the way, but no one seems to mind)
-some drawn out exposition that repeatedly hits the audience over the head with exactly what is happening and drops some serious hints at how it may be resolved.
awww the protagonist.who was bad has changed, he isn't bad!ooohhh millionaire bad guy is still bad!good guy (alien) vs bad guy (alien)good guys win, but for several minutes you think one has died.-He hasn't died, that would ruin the chances of a (very heavily hinted at) sequel.
That's about it. Nothing about it even hints at being risky, inventive or imaginative. From what I've read quite a bit of this film was left on the cutting room floor to bring its rating down from an 18 (R), to widen the audience and leave it open to a Venom / Spidey face of in the future, but unfortunately what is left is something that feels like a rehash of The Incredible Hulk, not the best foundation for a film.Plot holes:The whole symbiotic relationship is a bit muddled, they need the perfect host to live, but also a large test tube will do? Also why do they 'eat' the host if they need them to live?Why does Riot want Venom to return with him?The simbiotes plan to return to their planet and bring back more, why didn't they load the first rocket with more? Why allow the first humans to capture them In the first place? Why not enter the first humans and then load up the first rocket?There are a number more but you get the idea.I know it's just a film, and when it comes to comic book and sci-fi stuff you've got to forgive a few leaps of logic, but for me there's to much to forgive in this film.","

"BandSAboutMovies","28 December 2018","Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad), Venom has appeared on plenty of worst of lists this year. I held back judgment until I saw the movie. I can sum it up in one word: underwhelming. But after all, who was clamoring for a Venom movie after Spider-Man 3? Who was needing one in 2018? And after the magic of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, why do filmmakers feel they can still be so lazy with superheroes?That said, Venom is critic proof. After all, it was a box office success, ultimately earning $855 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2018.It all comes down to one good thing: Tom Hardy. It's like this dude has to have the craziest voices in movies. His Eddie Brock voice is just the most need to please accent ever, while Venom, in his own words, is a ""James Brown lounge lizard."" The relationship between these two characters -- who become one person -- is the best part of the movie. Hardy also improvised a lot, such as when he jumps into a lobster tank to cool down. I kind of love that the dude was pretty much making up his own film. The actor claimed that he based his performance on Woody Allen, Conor McGregor and Redman.Everything else -- from the villains to Eddie Brock's relationships -- is as generic as it gets. Big points for having Jenny Slate in here, even if she does nothing. It's like the film felt it had to give us an origin when all we want to see is Venom break stuff. The end of the film, where he eats a criminal and meets Cletus ""Carnage"" Kasady (and come on, who doesn't want to watch Woody Harrelson against Hardy in a battle of accents and overacting) is exactly what everyone really wants, not nearly two hours of generic soldiers and Venom battling Elon Musk.In the spin of selling this movie, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch claimed that ""Venom was considered a spin on a horror film, inspired by the works of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, but with more pop and fun."" People that say these kinds of things have never seen films by these two directors. Get their words out of your mouth and make better movies.The hard part of this whole thing is that there's a tease of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which will either make you say, ""I should have just watched that"" or ""Man, that was such a better movie.""","

"GunnersMate","6 October 2018","As the latest installment in a sea of Marvel characters brought to the screen, the bar is set high and the expectation for cinematic ""awesomeness"" is inevitable. While Venom was not as epic in scale and delivery as those in the same genre that have come before it, it was a fast-paced, visually intensive, funny, and ultimately entertaining two hours of story-telling. Eddie Brock was very human (and ultimately - as this is first and foremost an origin story - very alien) character with plenty of heart to overshadow his faults. Venom's strength lies in the fact that Eddie Brock's interactions with his lady-faire, the various people in his life, and his titular parasitic companion are interesting even without the obligatory bad-guy to fight. Some CGI in the film could have been stronger, but when it works, it works brilliantly; and while there is comic-book predictability to the plot, the story is enjoyable enough that the shortcomings are only a slight distraction to a movie which is ultimately worth a second (or third) watch.","

"Rectangular_businessman","15 October 2018","I honestly enjoyed Venom much more than most of those ridiculously overhyped superhero films from the recent years, which despite being inspid and formulaic tend to have raving reviews, while this movie got plenty of hate from the critics.But at least I am glad to see audiences genuinely enjoyed this movie, because, despite having a couple of awkward moments, this was genuinely interesting to watch, instead of merely being the same regurgitated crap of always: This must be the result of the inclusion of horror elements in this story, and while I wish this movie had been rated R as it was originally planned, the result is still satisfying anyway.I'm still not entirely sure about this whole ""Spider-verse"" idea (Why all the movies have to be part of a ""serialized universe"" these days?) but at least Venom was step in the right direction in my opinion.","

"flintridge0503","19 October 2018","I always knew Tom has acting skills when I first saw him on screen as the bad guy in Star Trek Nemesis as Shinzon. He stood out from the crowd and I knew he would get big one day. His portrayal of Brock is spot on and is worth the price of admission just to see it. But you'll also be entertained as well because this was a better than expected movie with good action scenes and the funny relationship between Brock and Venom. I can't express enough how talented Hardy is. It's not easy to keep transforming yourself into different characters and if you see his body of work, he is a different person everytime, and that takes major skills. Tom Cruise is always going to be Tom Cruise playing characters, but Tom Hardy will literally transform into that character, from the habits, to their accents, all the way down to the walk, posture, and stare. He must spend a lot of time studying these characters because he's almost a master chameleon of sorts. But enough about the talented Mr. Hardy. Go out and treat yourself to this great movie.","

"pjgowtham","28 December 2018","I was a bit skeptical before watching this movie. The ratings weren't like the other marvel movies. But this movie has a true potential. The dark humour was the highlight of the show. It was scary and comical at the same time. It's definitely hard for movie creators to pull that off.The writing was well thought and scientific. It does differ so much from spider man's version of venom. Eddie Brock's character pairs well with venom's making them an effective pair. Most marvel movies are just superpower and action oriented. But this movie had the best balance of story, psychology and action.Absolutely loved it.","

"knightofassassin","3 October 2018","I went to watch this movie on its first day available where I live, expecting something that I would rate somewhere between 6 and 7. But it went over that and here I am giving it a 9 (more like 8.5 but I rounded it up because it deserves it)While the story itself was not outstanding, the execution was fun and kept me engaged, and that is for me the most important aspect in a movie. Character relationships worked, and the jokes were well placed.Oh, and that kiss!! Omg that kiss! I loved it.The only thing that ever bothered me was that the image quality felt outdated, but I got used to it after 15 minutes in. Then there were the symbiotes, which didn't really blend well with their surroundings.All in all, this is one of my favorite movies of the year. It managed to be gritty when it needed to, and funny when it meant relief. Also, the action sequences were, in a good way, over the top fun.I loved it.","

"daviddilligaf","3 October 2018","This is a genuinely good movie which has been unfairly panned by critics. I went in expecting another Suicide Squad mess, but 90% of the movie was thoroughly enjoyable.Is it perfect and Oscar worthy? Of course not, it's a Venom movie. What it is, is a good fun time.To start with, the trailer completely misses the tone of the movie. This is a dark buddy comedy and you should know that going in.There's bad CGI, a forgettable villain and an anticlimactic final act. These are all true. However, if you want a funny, character driven origin story, this will be for you.Hardy gives one of my favourite of his performances; you can tell he had so much fun playing the role and his two characters (Brock and Venom) bounce off each other so well.Think of a very ""aware of itself"" Venom story with clear influences from both Deadpool and your favourite buddy cop movie, with a dark twist, and that's what you're getting. I genuinely did have a lot of fun seeing this movie and feel that you should avoid as many reviews as possible so you can go in with an open mind. Hopefully you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was!","

"brasierelectric","8 October 2018","Definitely liked this movie better than I anticipated. Not sure why the critics hated it so much. Pretty sure it's because it appeals to a broader audience, The creators of this movie went a bit safer with the content to appeal to a larger scope of audience. That said, it definitely pushes the limits for a PG-13 movie. Also, more humor than I expected as well ( which I enjoyed :) my oldest kid only gave it three out of 10 stars because he wanted it to be darker and harsher ( so, if that's what you're looking for, maybe you're not going to enjoy this as much as I did )","

"Tradniam","4 October 2018","I don't see enough things to believe this movie deserves the word of succesfull solo filming Spider-Man's famous nemesis. 
Venom is so light and predictable. 100% remaking of Spider-Man's origin plot. No surprise at all.
Hardy is so bright on his dark appearance. It is not in MCU yet, is it? Keep off the fun, what they should have done. I remember first look of Venom shows Hardy was in agony scene. But last night Brock was totally fine, cute and healthy. Brock is not desperate enough to have no choice but accepting cooperation with the alien symbiote. I don't know if producer has few parts cut down, because I lost the moment of thrill I have been thinking about this Venom since its first trailer.
Everything is mediocre here.
I believe Venom's CGI should have been better than Spider-Man's.
I believe Brock should have been darker.
I believe Drake's hitmen should have been meaner and more sophisticated.
I believe director should have brought totally new stuffs. I see Hardy as the way he is, he acts, walks, talks. And Riz Ahmed, start knowing him as he stars many good films. Same as Hardy. He doesn't improvise enough to be a villain. Exactly same gesture and look as his other movies. Why not learning from Irfan Khan. We can see he is totally altering for each of his role.","

"jboothmillard","15 October 2018","There have been a couple of anti-superhero movies before, where a villain or anti-hero is the lead, including Catwoman and Suicide Squad, the well-known Marvel character, enemy of Spider-Man, previously appeared in the not so good Spider-Man 3, this was his first solo movie, directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad). Basically, a probe belonging to bioengineering corporation Life Foundation has crash landed in Malaysia, after exploring space for new habitable worlds. A comet covered in symbiotic lifeforms was discovered, four samples have been brought back to Earth, one escaped and caused the crash, the other three samples are transported to the Life Foundation research facility in San Francisco. CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) learns that the symbiotes cannot survive without oxygen-breathing hosts, which often reject the symbiosis. Investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) reads a classified document about Drake's human trials, his fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), an attorney involved in preparing a lawsuit defence for Life Foundation, was in possession of this document. Eddie confronts Drake, leading to both Eddie and Anne losing their jobs, Anne breaks off their engagement and ends their relationship. Six months later, Drake is getting closer to achieving successful symbiosis. Eddie is approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate), one of Drake's scientists who disagrees with his methods and wants to help Eddie expose him. She helps Eddie break into the research facility to search for evidence, there he is shocked to find an acquaintance of his, homeless woman Maria (Melora Walters), has become one of Drake's test subjects. Eddie attempts to rescue Maria, but she attacks him and the symbiote possessing her transfers from her body to his, leaving her dead. Eddie escapes, but he soon begins displaying strange symptoms and reaches out to Anne for help, her new boyfriend Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott) examines Eddie and discovers the symbiote. Meanwhile, Drake executes Skirth for her betrayal by exposing her to the remaining captive symbiote, which ultimately dies, this means the symbiote inside Eddie is the only known surviving specimen. Drake sends mercenaries to retrieve Eddie and the symbiote inside him, but it takes over Eddie's body and transforms him into a monstrous creature that fights off the attackers. Taking shelter outside of the city, the symbiote communicates with Eddie and introduces itself as Venom, and it explains that the comet is an invasion force searching for new worlds where the symbiotes can possess and devour the inhabitants. Venom offers to spare Eddie if he helps the symbiotes achieve their goal, and Eddie soon comes to enjoy the superhuman attributes that the symbiote gives him. Eddie breaks into his old workplace to give evidence of Drake's crimes, but a SWAT team surround him on the way out, so Venom transforms him once again to escape. Anne witnesses this transformation and takes Eddie back to Lewis's office, where it is revealed that the symbiote inside of Eddie is slowly rotting his internal organs, Eddie also admits that the symbiote has two weaknesses: high-pitched noises and fire. Although Venom claims the organ damage is a fixable part of their symbiosis, Eddie uses the noise of an MRI machine to weaken the symbiote long enough for Eddie to separate from it, Eddie is then captured by Drake's men. Meanwhile, the fourth symbiote, Riot, has made its way from Malaysia to San Francisco by hopping from body to body, including an EMT (emergency medical technician) (Michelle Lee) from the crash site, an elderly woman (Vickie Eng), and a little girl (Zeva DuVall). Riot bonds with Drake, he agrees to take Riot in a Life Foundation space probe to collect the rest of the symbiotes and bring them to Earth. Anne reluctantly bonds with Venom so they can free Eddie, they are eventually bonded again, Venom states he has been convinced to help protect the Earth from his kind through his interactions with Eddie. The pair attempt to stop Riot and Drake with Anne's help, Venom damages the probe as it takes off, causing it to explode and kill both Riot and Drake, Anne believes Eddie is no longer bonded to Venom after this, and that the symbiote also died in the explosion. However, the Eddie and Venom remain secretly bonded and set out to protect the city by killing criminals, Eddie also returns to journalism, and is invited to interview incarcerated serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson). Also starring Scott Haze as Security Chief Roland Treece, Peggy Lu as Mrs. Chen, Malcolm C. Murray as Lewis Donate, Sope Aluko as Dr. Collins, Wayne Pére as Dr. Emerson, Bruce Almighty's Emilio Rivera as Lobby Guard Richard and Stan Lee as Dapper Dog Walker. Hardy is likeable as the reporter, and he thrives as the snarly voice of Venom, together they make an amusing twisted buddy duo, Ahmed is a slightly two-dimensional power-hungry scientist villain, and Williams is also a bit simple as the ex-girlfriend. There is no argument, the special effects to create the alien creatures and exciting sequences are brilliant, and there are worthwhile fast-paced chases and fights, but the overall film is a bit of a mess, the story and dialogue is a bit predictable, it shifts awkwardly between tones of tension and thrills, adding near forced humour, and sometimes it doesn't seem to know where to go, a reasonable almost below average superhero fantasy action horror. Okay!","

"MiroslavKyuranov","3 October 2018","What the hell are you? Well, the latest Sony ""wanna be great"" Spider related movie, which is not. I mean the main idea to build your own cinematic universe separted from the MCU, without Spider-Man, but with the future plan to cross with him it's kinda too optimistic for Sony. This movie demands to be R-Rated...or not, this is just unnecessary movie. I mean nobody wants it. People want Venom in the MCU with Spidey, not Sony making their own universe.Tom Hardy and the connection with Venom, is the best thing about the movie. There is some action, the story is blunt and there is nothing really special other than action scenes and some humor at the end.I really hope the second one to be a lot better than this. For sure, there're some people, which are not so invested into the comicbook world and will like it as a separated property.One of the credit scenes is good, but it was predictable and I don't know what the future of this universe will be.At the end my score it's still high...","

The female characters are dull, with no interesting dialogue and terrible acting, plus cliche roles! The 'bad guy' is laughable, he is not threatening or convincing in the slightest, total miscast. In fact most of the characters are mis cast.","

The scenes whit venom was to slow and bad filmed for my taste, maby cause I was expecting more of it, but it did OK.. Only bad about it was the length and the sudden Fit for the second venom when all others exploded? To little action for my taste, but have watched it 3-4 times already..
But still a bit bad for the venom scenes, the acting was good but it's always that whit the main man.. But nothing like the comic book you grew up with.. So hope they are on track with no 2 and 3, if not its gonna get forgotten fast.. Had been waiting for this one since I heard it was going to be a movie, but to short, to little Venom to say it was a success, but taste is a good thing, everybody has one...","

"firefox-68028","4 October 2018","Just to start I want to say my favourite super hero/ villain is venom so I may seem a bit biased but I tried to keep a level head going in and not let the fanboy out.My honest feelings were that the film is exactly what it needed to be. Thank god they didn't pull and amazing Spider-Man 2 and tried to set up a wider universe. Yes there is space too but I believe this film can stand as a stand alone movie.The opening to the point of Eddies first contact to me was really poor in the acting department and the story seemed very messy here however as soon as that symbiote hits it's full steam ahead! Tom hardy has always been an actor that I can really rely on in movies and after seeing legend, (an excellent film which I highly recommend) I had no doubt about his ability to form the two identities of Eddie and venom.The romance sub plot surprised me and I thought it was handled in a way rarely seen in superhero movies so well done on that. A big point of content was the jokes. Yes the ""turd in the wind"" line is a bit cringy but I think a huge amount of the jokes do hit home. For people who have seen the film a certain joke regarding an elevator that was short and sweet and had me genuinely laughing at it. Time to talk about venom himself! CGI on him is how I wanted venom to look in a live action version, that slimy, toothy, grinning look that looks like something straight from the comics.This film will definitely not be for those that aren't really into comics and I think this film may hit a special place in some fans hearts like me. At the end of the day I say go see the movie and see if you feel the same way. Something that I found really helped me was I went in not thinking of the MCU at large and Spider-Man at all and only when I was 1 hour in did I think ""I haven't thought about Spider-Man once!""To me venom is a surprisingly good film with some great action, visuals and comedy that occasionally stumbles, especially the clunky opening 30 minutes","

The plot of this film was like a bad TV pilot. The film was just 2 hours of cringe . How are Venom fans not disappointed by this film? It doesn't do justice toward the character because it's bodged down with some of the most lazy writing I have ever seen . I usually disagree with the critics toward Superhero movies but this time I have to side with them. My friends and I made fun of this piece of crap during and after the movie. This film also would've benefited a tiny bit with an R rating but a complete rewrite of the film would have helped it the most. The editing was really choppy and the first 15 minutes are embarrassing. It's one of the worst superhero films I've ever watched. I wasn't even expecting much and I was disappointed. I really regret seeing this in theaters because the more money this makes the more Sony is going to put out garbage content like this. Heck I saw this on a matinee and I feel cheated. I could have bought a $5 blu-ray and watched something good with my friends. I could have rented a movie for $3 and bought off brand soda. But I made a bad decision by going to this film and handing the man on the counter $5. I'm never gonna see my money again because Venom consumed it and my stupid brain let it happen.","

There is no build up, some scenes just happen for the sake of happening and lack of better character development.The acting was fine.Like most films they always have that annoying lead female character. This film is no different. The Lead Female has a couple moments where you want her to just die.CGI was meh.Overall the only good thing about the movie is the mid credit scene.","

"wellthatswhatithinkanyway","31 October 2018","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEddie Brock (Tom Hardy) makes a living doing online videos, attempting to expose big scandals. In his latest video, he has tangled with Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of a bio-engineering firm that has been involved in a number of controversial events, costing him his job and his fiancé. Drake has secretly got hold of a bizarre, shape shifting mutagen, and after breaking into his laboratory, Eddie unwittingly becomes its host, transforming him into the crime fighting gargoyle Venom.There's nothing like an adult orientated comic book adaptation, not least because it excludes the auditorium you're watching it in from any noisy, rambunctious kids, as well as just generally providing a more rounded, uncensored experience. They tend to be more obscure, little known creations that just have their own little cult following among their devotees, and no parents will be pestered by their offspring to take them along to see it, having never heard of it. These have ranked among some of my favourites, such as Deadpool 1 and 2 and The Punisher films (no matter what anyone says!) but Venom sadly falls short of this mark, while doing nothing aesthetically wrong, it's just too mechanical and ineffective to be one you'd want to see again.The first big disappointment is that, in spite of the 15 certificate, there doesn't seem to be anything more edgy than in your average Spiderman film, despite some rocky language. The host character, played charismatically by a wise-cracking Hardy, takes up much of the first half of the film, but the titular character takes too long to make his presence felt, and despite being physically impressive, with a seriously scary face, sounds too much like The Honey Monster from the Sugar Puffs ads. The action is shot too close up, with too many quick cuts and, even being an action film, is too loud. All the dialogue feels stilted and staged, and none of it sounds real or convincing. The wafer thin plot isn't strong enough to hold everything together throughout the course. Meanwhile, Ahmed is too weedy and nerdy to be taken seriously as the villain.It subtly borrows little pieces of other films, from more adult fare like Predator, to kids films like Super Mario Brothers, without having any kind of solid structure to stand as a film on its own. It's all rounded off with the title track from Eminem, who's gone from making personal, deep raps about his life to doing the soundtrack to superhero movies. I've just found out the character was created by that Todd McFarlane guy, the same guy behind Spawn, which this reminded me so much of. The film version of that was absolutely savaged by critics when it came out, but I loved it. This, sadly, doesn't hold up, but you just know there'll be an inevitable sequel that'll be even worse. **","

"thesupershadow","6 October 2021","VENOM - my review: Overall, I think it's one of the best anti-hero films to be released, this even despite being a separate version from the 'cannon' spider-man series/character. It follows a not too confusing and linear pace, but at the same time doesn't feel too rushed and allows for some really intimate and engaging acting unlike - Avengers: infinity war...Let me assure you, the curse of spider-man 3 has been broken! Venom can work as a violent yet funny character similar to deadpool, the CGI is incredible, the humour and script is well-written, there's even hints of Alien-film soundtrack and the famous French horn sound used as the theme for Venom in Spider-man 3 makes a return.This film could've turned out much, much worse. Don't trust those bad reviews based on other repetitive Marvel films, look at the winning financial viewing results, or better yet watch it yourself and decide. Tom Hardy has done this role JUSTICE!","

Cast did well, the dynamic between Brock and Venom is so much fun and absurd, the action's decent, along with the score, the mid-credit scene (Carnage) is intriguing and I LOVE the footage of Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse during the credits.BUT Venom is also another safe, generic and average superhero movie, yes, even down to the final CGI fight between (anti)hero and villain. So, I don't hate it, nor do I like it, it's right down the middle. Save your money and support Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, since that looks EXCEPTIONAL.","

"PradoCedric","25 October 2018","This is definitely the most disappointing and one of the worst superhero film since Batman & Robin, Catwoman, Fant4stic, and Suicide Squad. There are so things that get this film wrong and right.For the wrong, the tone is completely inconsistent and all over the place. The film desperately tries to be gritty but turns to be a joke, and its attempt to blend in with sci-fi, superhero, and horror genres makes it convoluted and had a hard time seeking its identity. Even the CGI, editing, and pacing is laughably bad. The worst offender here had to be the script. From its clunky, bland and nonsensical plot to its terrible lines, dialogue and one-liners, it clearly shows the film's banality as well its toxic and venomous conditions.Even the most charismatic and respectable actors are wasted in this film. Riz Ahmed is horrendously miscast, and combined with his hammy, stale and mediocre acting. The fantastic Michelle Williams is given no favors despite her very best in giving her performance of Anne Weying with depth and conviction but ultimately falls flat and is even forced to deliver a weak dialogue and acting.On the other hand, here's what the film got right. Tom Hardy makes an excellent performance as Eddie Brock/Venom, which at least redeem its Venom portrayal from the horrendous Topher Grace performance of Venom in the terrible Spiderman 3. The dynamic and chemistry between Eddie Brock and Venom along with Hardy's performance are the only of the film's saving graces, but it's not enough to redeem this cyanide trainwreck.The most disappointing of the film itself is the PG-13 rating, which effectively weakens the quality overall and even restrains its character development from going to its darker characteristics, which this film could have gone better with an R rating, considering the success of rated R superhero films such as the Deadpool films and Logan. Still, this is not the worthy adaptation that Venom character is truly deserves to and even the performance of Hardy as well its dynamic deserved better than this misfire.","

The conversation between Eddie and Venom work perfectly and stay true to the comic books.Stunning action scenes, the part with the S.W.A.T team is awesome, the bike chase is very cool and well filmed.
My only bad point was the end fight, it seemed to be over far to fast, I'd of liked to see it padded out a bit more.Great fun action movie that I watched with a huge smile on my face, I can't wait to see it again very soon.","

"Coventry","29 June 2021","My 12-year-old son is an avid Marvel/comic book adaptation fanatic, whilst his old man is a diehard horror lover; - so watching this ""Venom"" together is probably the closest we come to a father & son bonding session. With nearly two hours of non-stop digital effects, mass destruction, cool transformations and plenty of action, my son had a jolly good time. Me, being an old-fashioned guy and a hater of computerized playgrounds, had quite many eye-rolling moments throughout the film. Still, I found ""Venom"" much more entertaining than the average installment in the ""Avengers"", ""Spiderman"", ""Thor"" or ""Captain America"" franchises, simply because the pivot character is (initially, at least...) a purely evil and undefeatable extraterrestrial force. I tried to look at ""Venom"" as a traditional type of alien invasion Sci-Fi/horror, with the nasty looking symbiote being reminiscent to the creatures in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or ""The Thing"". Although far superior to human beings, the alien is a parasite and needs a bodily host. The fact that he fires off slick one-liners and develops a conscience is most unfortunate, but commercially inevitable, I guess. Oh well, at least the big, ugly and monstrous creep bites off a couple of heads. I'm always in favor of that.","

"deloudelouvain","17 December 2018","I have absolutely no clue why Venom has such a low rating. I understand that if you don't like Marvel movies this one isn't going to make you change your mind, even though I thought it was refreshing for a Marvel movie. But why would you watch this genre of movies if it's not your thing? I'm not a particular huge fan of Marvel, even though I watch them all, but I like those kind of movies because it's easy entertainment. Venom might not be a superhero but it's for sure entertaining to watch. Not as funny as Deadpool, but funnier than all the other superhero movies. Tom Hardy has the right character face to play this role. But the most positive point about Venom must be the special effects and CGI's. Those were on top and made this a proper action movie that you will enjoy from the beginning till the end. So just forget about those negative reviews, they just don't have a clue how an enjoyable Marvel movie should be.","

Boy I enjoyed every second of this film. Tom Hardy is not only funny but I can relate to him and his symbiote (not his parasite, never call him that) Venom! I love them both. Tom always plays serious and intimidating characters but in this movie, he is funny as hell especially his interactions with Venom. Now I am a certified Tom Hardy fan. There is no actor out there who can better portray this role. He was born for this role. The movie was a joy to watch, I got sad it finished too soon for me. I tend to ignore critics' reviews coz MY review matters most to me. I definitely will get the digital copy of this movie so I can watch it over and over whenever and wherever I want to watch. So for the ones who haven't watched it yet, better watch it now!","

Hardy is excellent as always, and while the story may be generic it's still a perfectly enjoyable film. The stunts are amazing, the car chase scene especially. Plot holes? Maybe one or two slight inconsistencies but again, nothing major. It's a perfectly enjoyable film and I would definitely recommend to see it and judge for yourself as the critics often get it wrong (The last Jedi, black panther etc)","

"silverathan","27 April 2023","Venom is a movie that should've been R-Rated, the character on the comic books is a bloody monster, a menacing villain and sometimes an anti-hero, but just sometimes, and even in those times, he keeps his brutality and ferocity. Here, in this movie, the violence has been softened, so what is left to the screenplay are some ""Marvel kind jokes"".Somehow, one or another are good, but they're not enough to fullfil the plot. Having a Venom without the Spider-Man It's a bad idea, but It can be sustainable, unfortunately It's not the case here.Even having good acting scenes with Hardy and Michelle, the storytelling is too goofy and childish, the sensation is that you're watching a comedy movie.The action is cool and the photography is okay. In summary, It's a good movie to watch when you're bored or looking to anything to watch.","

Deadpool proved without a shadow of a doubt that an R rated super/antihero movie will fill seats and studio wallets, yet for some insane reason they went with trying to make it kiddie-friendly. It didn't work. Everything just feels held back, as if you're actually just watching a really long preview. Venom needs to be unleashed, and you just can't do it when he's on the same shelf as Toy Story.","

I almost never have a desire to watch movie again, but I would watch this over and over again and I would be entertained every time like the first time.. The only thing that I personally didn't like was the lead actress, she was just plane for some reason, it kinda looked to me that her face is full of fillers so she couldn't do much with her face expressions, other than that for me it's a 10 and big recommendations.","

Venom is not jocular character. Carnage is the jocular character but mainly he doing psychopath jokes. And in this movie Venom is boring and doing too much joke.. I seriously suprised and said ''What the hell is this?'' First of all movie starts too quickly. Everything happens too quickly and skipping everything too fast. Last battle was a joke. I don't know why people like it. They was just dancing and skipping everything. There is no detail. Riot's death is the biggest joke. I don't like it. I don't care anyone say.

I never seen any shows or movies with Venom or know much about what I was going to see. But as the movie went along it quickly grabbed my attention. I loved how the plot was set up and there wasn't any time during the movie that lost the audience attention which is very important when making a film. The movie consisted of different camera angels such as bird eye view, close up, mid range, etc. which is key when showing action scenes and car chasing scenes. Eddie the main character in the movie is a casual regular guy that didn't have a lot going on (when he became Venom) which I think is pretty cool because most super hero movies the hero is usually a popular guy or someone wealthy. But In this film Eddie an ordinary guy which captivated the audience more in my opinion because people can relate more to it. I highly recommend this movie to someone who hasn't seen it unless you don't like action movies or a Nun. Michael Vinogradsky","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","22 October 2018","Venom's a beautifully bad movie that's all-out in its over-the-top nature and its overly oddball Tom Hardy. This movie exists purely as an overdue tie-in to 2007's Spider-Man 3: and boy does this ever show in the film's mid-2000s-inspired Hollywood aesthetics. It's got the hallmarks of a non-MARVEL Studios MARVEL film: stingy references related to the ONE central character in the movie due to rights issues and building up to sequels before even telling the story at hand.This film is an eccentrically empty action-adventure that's trying to tie-in with the modern superhero film craze taking the world by storm. Unfortunately, Venom isn't a very strong example of the genre's strengths: it's a movie made because 'it-had-to-be-done' for Sony (mind you it's not nearly as ATROCIOUS Fox's/Constantin Films' Fant4stic!). Venom's cynical but dumb fun, average story filled with 'ballsy' action sequences guaranteed to make fans of the character proud, but there's not a hell of a lot else to discover in this film.Venom gets 2.5/5 turds in the wind.","

But I am pretty sure that's the case... I've seen worse movies who had at least 50 points from them.Still, it's not the best Marvel movie out there, with Black Panther being the best and probably the greatest surprise that MCU has ever given to us, but it was enjoyable and I was really impressed with the portrayal of Venom, considering the storyline in the comic books. SPOILER ALERT: there's a lot of schizophrenia in this one :))","

The movies overall theming was too good and really epic for the young adults in the audience!I knocked off a star b/c of the use of foul Language spread throughout the movie. If you ask me, This is not really considered a child friendly movie! But other than that, the effects were amazing especially in 3D!!!!Heed my advise, if you have the extra money in the piggy bank lying around, go see this movie in 3-D or IMAX 3-D it's well worth it!The cast of the movie was just phenomenal and Venoms backstory really came to life and I couldn't asked for anything better.If you have little kids and they want a superhero, I suggest wait for Spider-man into the spider verse to come out before bringing the little ones! This movie is aimed toward the young adults and older adults!But overall, Great movie and well worth the wait!!!!","

One of the worst scripts written of 2018, surprising enough the same writer wrote the script for aquaman which was a film that I overall enjoyed but the script was my biggest issue and of course it had to be the same person. The only thing this movie has going for itself is the performance by Tom Hardy, he steals the show with his acting and performance as usual. Everything else was either bad or generic. Even the venom character was so god awful. (I'm not a fan of judging a film so harshly on CGI and I won't do that, in fact I thought it was solid work with the effects department, and it wasn't distracting me from the plot so I'm ok with effects, and if anyone uses that as a reason to bash this film I think it's unfair, if that's that case you should bash older movies back in the 70s for having effects that weren't good) but back to venom, his CGI was great, his character was so terrible, THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE TRANSCENDED THE GENRE TO NEW TERRITORY, think about it VENOM is a VILLAIN not a HERO. Sure I'm familiar with comics and he was a anti hero in some, but this movie missed the mark to create a unique film, this movie is so bland and generic I felt as if I watched it before, the characters are boring the villain is even more boring the CGI final fight was ehh, and the ending is ugh, the action is so repetitive and unnecessary, this movie was god awful and the soundtrack was even worse, this movie is the downfall as compared to Eminem's song for this movie which was probably arguably even more worse and annoying than the film itself. (AND IM A HUGE FAN OF SLIM SHADY) Venom should have been DCs joker. Taking a villain and making a compelling story of the villain landscape, but no they turn him into a forced PG13 freak forced terrible dialogue and a plot so boring and far from original that the only interesting thing this movie has going for itself is the concept of the symbiotic/human relationship which for me gets interesting with Tom hardy and venom
until it gets annoying and the performance by Tom hardy holds this film up. THATS IT. The acting is all around actually good as well, it's just the script that really holds the film so far back and it's the characters around Eddie that make it so boring that I don't even like the characters no matter how good their acting and performance is.Acting 7/10
Script 2/10
Plot 3/10
Screenplay 5/10
Cinematography 4/10
Soundtrack 2/10
Special Effects 7/10
Editing 4/10Overall Venom has its moments to be held and saved nearly by Tom hardy, but the film was shot so blandly the bad script takes over the film very much and the compelling aspect that makes a film unique doesn't even feel like it's there, feels as if the director forced it to be there. This film should have been such indistinguishable and more hah just another generic boring story. Am I saying they can't make a pg13 venom movie? NO, and I think going a anti hero route can be cool, but this movie isn't doing it folks, and I am sure if they went the darker direction into diving into the villain side it would have been much better, but no, Sony wanted that money and these people gave it to them for this garbage film. terrible film 5/10 and that's just being nice","

"evan-pahl","30 October 2020","Most professional critics didn't like this film but casual movie fans loved it. Venom as a character gets a second chance after getting entirely misrepresented in Spiderman 3 (2007) and gets it done in a way that can only be described as metal; the tone totally flipped the script and took the audience by surprise the moment Tom Hardy climbed into the lobster tank, letting you know exactly what kind of movie they were going to give you.
However, Michelle Williams' parts seemed like they were off-beat and held no weight for the plot or tone trying to conveyed. Marvel also tends to have a pattern of making the villain nothing much more than a evil, bigger mirror version of the hero; Sony fell for that same trap with this film, but only to showcase that power of the symbiotes as characters withing the universe, as Sony is seemingly trying to cash in on their own Spider-Villian-verse; understanding that much helps the viewer sit back and enjoy the CGI spectical of the film, which is pretty great considering it is a lot of very well done CGI. Overall this was a funny action movie for a popular Spiderman villian/antihero film that already has a sequel in the works. Expect big things from Sony after this film.","

"Slarkshark","14 February 2021","Close enough to the comics that it's respectable. I do prefer the origin including Spider-Man, but I believe they were able to pull it off without him. I would be lying if I didn't want Spider-Man to come into the picture at some point down the road, and hopefully within the MCU.This was definitely an improvement and much better casting than the previous live action Venom in 'Spider-Man 3'. Yes, it would have been better had it been rated R. Venom is just better as a no mercy anti-hero with gory finishes. The CGI looked good I thought and was entertaining as a whole.All around a fairly decent action movie. Nothing too critical about it, but also nothing extraordinary. Great Eminem track to cap it off with. Also, looking forward to Carnage!","

"dushchenko","9 October 2018","One of the most awaited premiers in 2018 was reboot of Venom by Marvel. It was released last week and I couldn't wait to watch it. So, I've went to my favourite cinema right away, but decided to finally try 4DX. And the movie is appropriate for it.
I can agree that it was definitely a great experience. The movie is full of action and immersion into it was pretty deep I'd say.
Will be Venom a good creature, or bad one? Will Venom control Eddie Brock by absorbing him, or the last one gonna be in charge? Is Venom a stupid bloodthirsty animal, or is he smart? These are question you have in your head before going to the cinema. The filmmakers tried to keep intrigue as much longer.
I'm a fan of Marvel movies and waited for this one, of course. In general, it's a cool film. Graphics is incredible. Venom and other species there look so real like in any other movie. And there is also my favorite Michelle Williams. But, Tom Hardy was on point as well. It won't be fair, if not to tell that the cast is just amazing.
But, actually that's almost all what I can say about it. If I haven't watched it in 4DX, I suppose that my impression could be even worse, unfortunately. Don't know what the authors did think about, 'coz the plot is so predictable. Why they decided to do it like that? Wonderful graphics, but simple plot. Hmm...
Of course, there is perfect humor like in other Marvel films, but not so much, like in Iron Man, or Deadpool, what you'd expect.
In any case, Venom is a great movie for watching in the cinema exactly 'coz of its marvelous graphics and action. And you'll for sure find something to like it for.","

"tbills2","29 June 2019","The Good: Tom Hardy shows that he can act with the best of them. I really appreciate Hardy's seemingly all out performance with this subpar material that is Venom. Hardy is one of my favorite male actors. He kills it! I love Tom Hardy! Michelle Williams is really great like she always is and the dedication to the story isn't so bad.The Bad: Venom. The Venom character isn't a total whiff, but Venom's like too big and I personally never knew Venom could attack like Stretch Armstrong with his hands and arms I mean I knew he could be like that but Venom's like Mr. Fantastic is this flick plus virtually every single other side character is bad and the lighting of the movie is God awful too. Spiderman should of been in it it like needed more characters! It is NOT very relatable to the audience and it's not very fun.The Venom: Hardy rules Williams is beautiful beyond belief I love symbiotes and my favorite male rapper Eminem has a sick title track on this soundtrack!'when somethings n ur mitochondrial cuz it latched on 2 u like Knock Knock let the devil n malevolent as ive ever been head is spinning this medicine screaming l-l-l-let us n!! l-l-l-like a salad bowl edgar allan poe bedridden should of been dead a long time ago liquid tylenol gelatin think my skeletons melting wicked i get all high when i think ive smelled the scent of elephant manure hell i meant kahlua screw it 2 hell with it i went through hell with accelerants & blew up my-my-myself again!! volkswagen tailspin bucket matches my pale skin ! mayo & went from hellmanns & being rail thin filet-o-fish scribble jam rap olympics 97 freaknik how can i b down me & bizarre n florida ! proofs room slept on the floor of da motel then dr. dre said hell Yea!! & i got his stamp like a postcard word 2 mel-man & i know theyre gonna hate but i dont care i barely can wait 2 hit em with the snare & the bass square n the face this world better prepare 2 get laced becuz theyre gonna taste my Venom!!!!!!!'Slim Shady is back this is one of Eminem's best songs ever.

"zardoz-13","17 November 2018","When Robert Downey, Jr.'s tour-de-force performance as irreverent arms manufacturer Tony Stark in ""Iron Man"" (2009) changed the standard-issue superhero genre, and The Marvel Cinematic Universe left the DC Universe wallowing in the dust. First, Paramount and then Disney appropriated the MCU, and DC is still staggering around in a hopeless daze despite their efforts to imitate Marvel. Second, a posse of charismatic Marvel show-stoppers ensued, and characters such as Thor, The Hulk, Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, Captain America, Black Panther, and Guardians of the Galaxy followed with great fanfare and success. Although all these heroes were slick, shiny, and sexy, Disney kept them as squeaky clear savory as their PG-13 ratings. Meantime, while DC struggled with the likes of Superman, Batman, and the Justice League, Disney's foremost Marvel studio rival Twentieth Century Fox sent their Marvel superheroes into action. ""The X-Men"" charted a far grittier path with director Bryan Singer, a notorious helmer who could never land a job with the Mouse House, any more than James Gunn will ever do again. Not only are Singer and Gunn originals, but they are also mutants in a sense. The rivalry between Disney and Fox is clear-cut, and Fox isn't as savory as the clowns at Disney. Unexpectedly, Fox shook up the Marvel Cinematic Universe with ""Deadpool,"" and Ryan Reynolds rocketed to fame as the snarky new kid on the block.""Deadpool,"" Reynolds, and Fox plunged recklessly into the rated-R zone, and they turned the MCU upside-down, enough to push the Wolverine epic ""Logan"" into the R-rated territory. Disney reins in their MCU with PG-13 ratings, while Fox has displayed greater flexibility with R-rated efforts. Sony, originally the home for ""Spider-man,"" has launched several other characters. If ""Deadpool"" took superhero sagas to the next level, ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleisher has taken it further with Tom Hardy in ""Venom."" Although ""Venom"" remains in the PG-13 zone, this new character shares more in common with ""Deadpool."" Despite the devastating critical reviews that mauled ""Venom"" in its opening weekend, the latest addition to the MCU soared to the top of the box office in its first week of release and came close to earning its production budget back in the first week.""Venom"" is a whole lot of fun, and Tom Hardy is far from restrained as he shares his body with an alien Symbiote. Tongue-in-cheek adequately epitomizes ""Venom,"" and this mash-up of an investigative reporter with alien pushes the envelope in a different but welcome direction. If you don't love ""Venom,"" then something is seriously wrong with you. The new origins epic about these two, who they are and how they came together is first-rate entertainment with a challenging villain and a hero who doesn't wear a spandex suit. Think of ""Venom"" as the flipside of ""Alien,"" with a sympathetic being from another world joining forces with a human, and you'll have some idea what to expect from this lively escapade that is flippant without being grotesque. Tom Hardy vanishes from sight once Venom takes over his body, which means that Hardy doesn't have to worry about a form-fitting superhero costume. Set in San Francisco, ""Venom"" chronicles the demise of Eddie Brock, an investigative journalist who loses his job when it goes off on a tangent with a billionaire megalomaniac who shoots rocket ships into space since NASA has powered down. Villainous Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed of ""Nightcrawler"") wants to explore the universe on his own terms, and this includes his dream of living on another planet in outer space. Drake's villainy knows no ends, and he is oblivious to the cost of achieving his dream. Literally, this guy has no qualms about doing whatever he wants no matter how illegal it is. One of his missiles brings an alien intelligence to Earth, and Drake wants to abandon the Earth that he believes is on a collision course with extinction. He wants to cohabit with an alien organism, so he can reside elsewhere in the galaxy.Imagine Drake's disgust when the only person that can survive fusion with his space organism is Eddie Brock. Earlier, Drake wielded his clout to get Brock fired from his job as an investigative television journalist. At the time, a naïve Eddie didn't realize the extent of Charlton Drake's power. Literally, our protagonist is taken down several notches, loses his job, and worse, his fiancée breaks up with him because he took a peek at her confidential files and used information from them to intimidate Drake. No sooner has Eddie been fired than he discovers to his chagrin that his fiancée, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams of ""A Thousand Acres"") has canned from her job as an attorney. Eventually, she finds another lover, Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott of ""The Veil""), but she still has feelings for Eddie. One of Carlton Drake's researchers, Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate of ""This Means War"") approaches a reluctant Eddie, who has not only lost Anne, but also had to move into a seamier apartment, about the unethical experiments that Drake is conducting on homeless people. Drake has deluded these poor people, and he confines them to a lab while he watches if they can co-exist with the alien creatures. The attempts repeatedly fail, until Eddie sneaks into Drake's facilities with Dr. Skirth's help and is absorbed by one of those things. Dr. Skirth calls these organisms 'symbiotes,' while Eddie refers to it as a parasite. Before long, Eddie realizes that his body is changing because of 'Venom,' and this creature can assert its power of him. Drake dispatches his henchmen to capture Eddie, and an adrenaline-laced, high speed chase through San Francisco ensues, with our hero performing some incredible acrobatics on a bike. Venom can talk to Eddie, but only Eddie can hear him. ""Venom"" qualifies as an unforgettable superhero epic. The scenes with the pistol-wielding thug who robs a convenience store where Eddie shops are fantastic!","

"james_mayer","21 October 2018","I just watched Venom tonight and OMG it was so amazing! A lot of action, intense scenes, and a lot of suspenseful moments. We don't see Venom until a while into the movie, but the build up was totally worth it! There are a few scenes where viewer discretion is advised, but it isn't that bad. There are a few curse words in the film, but nothing too bad. Not that scary at all, there are a few parts in the film where it gets a little intense, but nothing out of the ordinary. Also for those who have not watched the film yet, there is a scene after the credits, and its a pretty important scene. I really loved this movie and everything about it. It was a 10/10 in my opinion. I would definitely recommend for you to go see it. Not too graphic or scary, and not too plain and boring. Please see it because it is amazing!","

"oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx","8 October 2018","I guess the major feeling I get watching an MCU (Marvel Comics Universe) movie is, wow once the special effects industry was an auxiliary of the movie industry, now the movie industry is an auxiliary of the special effects industry. But I guess everyone's down with that these days? So I won't preach too hard about it, after all Méliès and his effects kicked it all off and so maybe we're back to the beginning of film, with all it's awkwardness and inappropriateness too.The movie was appealing to me from the poster and the trailer. A normal guy can become Venom, Venom don't take none of the brown stuff, he's gonna kick you ass right out of your face. So yeah a two hour holiday from the tediousness of the social contract.The film actually comes off as a bit of a buddy movie, inseparable parasite and host journalist Eddie Brock spends most of the movie bonding with comic effect. A main failure is that we're meant to believe that macho figurehead and multi-millionaire heartthrob Tom Hardy is playing a ""loser"". As usual with comic book stuff, you end up feeling that the resulting vigilantism is being given a bit more support than it probably should be getting (the effects of vigilantism are usually heartbreakingly stupid and tragic). The villain (I imagine Elon Musk probably didn't see the funny side with this one) and the antihero both basically have the same general activity, they do whatever the hell they want. But you have to get in bed with the devil to defeat the evil people, right? What popularised the ""work with your darkness"" nonsense, Dexter back in 2006? Or Jack Bauer back just after 911?So I enjoyed it, but probably ""needed a shower"" too. And like a chump I'll probably be back for a second serving of ""eyes, lungs"", and ""pancreas"", when they show the sequel.","

"DuskShadow","5 October 2018","SPOILER ALERT!I dont know how they got Hardy to do this, he has enough money...Another nail in the coffins for various comic book franchises. The movie had poor acting, hearing Tom Hardy try to sound american always reminds me of the joke from Family Guy where Liam Neeson tries sounding american in westerns.
There was no connection to spider man, though an allusion to the events leading Brock to leave new york (because of spidey in the comics) was dangled like a decayed carrot real quick.
The cgi was a tad lackluster, and the shading and lighting during most of the night and fight scenes were either under done or SUPER FAST-ONE-FRAME-MELDING-INTO-ANOTHER to try and overwhelm not only ones senses, but ones common sensibilities. Oh thingsarelame, but a quickly insertedexplative and the crowd just laughs... YAWN!There was no spidey reference at all, no logo therefore upon Venoms chest, so this must be in another universe as a franchise on its own. I didnt see J. Jonah Jameson, probably because his classic Charlie Chapman/Oliver Hardy ( no relation to tom) moustache would trigger idiots into going off about hitler. >,;,< BUt jameson's son was in the story, which was pivotal to the symbiotes collection by people, but it too felt so rushed and boring. The music was lame, the character development felt forced and bland. AND ITWAS ONLY PG-13. Oh and listening to Hardy talk softly most of the time in half whispers really made me laugh , even during attempted "" serious"" scenes. Aside from that and other lame elements that made me laugh out loud like a stupid little symbiote dog, I fought sleep often and was unimpressed with this movie. At least they went down broadway street for a hot second, but no boobs? YAh some people got their heads bit off, but no brains? Yahs ome people go sliced and diced, but no blood? They would move the camera far back during the killings that were supposed to be brutal and awesome.They made venom lame,weak, and too much of a try hard. And though I was expecting Cleetus Cassidy to be played by somebody big but unworthy, seeing Woody Harrelson with a red ""j fro""... he looked like a combo of Annie and Ronald McDonald. 5.8/10 for this cause Stan Lee had a cameo, and sexy lady venom moment. >,;,< Too many missed chances for greatness though.",NA

"gavinp9","4 October 2018","From the director of 'Zombieland' comes 'Venom', a non-Marvel Cinematic Universe film, featuring Spider-Man's arch-nemesis - but no Spider-Man (who's over in the MCU). Since it's a movie about an alien (""symbiote"") turning Eddie Brock (Hardy) into a superhero/antihero, you should suspend disbelief and expectations at the start. The symbiote is brought to Earth by Drake (Ahmed), a Branson/Musk-type who wants to colonize space. He's obviously evil.Anne (Williams) is Eddie's ex and has some scenes, as does Skirth (Slate), who's experimenting on the symbiotes. We finally get to see Venom about 50min in, after quite a bit of unnecessary build-up, and all hell essentially breaks loose. There's a pretty good car chase - we're obviously in San Francisco so the cars can get plenty of air - and some solid action/fight scenes.While it's all quite daft, and some of the scenes have the camera moving way too fast, overall it's Hardy, his charisma, and how he interacts with Venom that make it enjoyable and not totally stupid. The CGI's quite good and it's fun to see some of his powers. There's a few jokes - but definitely don't expect another 'Deadpool'.",NA
